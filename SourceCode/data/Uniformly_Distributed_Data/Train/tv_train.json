{"Title":"Good Alternative to Large CRT Screen","Author":"TT","ReviewID":"R3O7R39EWT76O2","Overall":"good","Content":"While shopping for a large screen television, I had considered the 32\" and 36\" Sony WEGAs.  However, this 43\" Sony projection TV had key advantages over the CRT WEGAs.KP-43 Advantages: Thinner  (shallower depth) than the 36\" WEGA; Lighter (about 100 lbs) than the  36\" WEGA; and Larger screen viewing area (43\" vs 36\").CRT  Advantages: Wider viewing angle (both vertical and horizontal); and Shorter  minimum viewing distance.Although the KP-43 projection TV has a larger  screen, it is lighter and can be moved more easily.  It also is a good  choice for apartments or other smaller living spaces.If picture quality  is critical to you, then you should be aware that you may lose detail in  the shadows since the black levels do not seem to be reproduced as  consistently or accurately as a professional monitors.  To calibrate  your TV for your viewing environment, I recommend renting the \"Video  Essentials\" DVD.  In general, you may need to decrease the PICTURE  (contrast), BRIGHTNESS, and SHARPNESS settings to achieve the best picture  quality.  With the factory settings, you may notice blooming and additional  noise.  You may also notice all the noise from traditional cable and  broadcast signals.  Therefore, you may wish to subscribe to digital  services.  There is a single component video input on the TV, which may not  be enough if you have digital cable and a DVD player.  You may need a  separate component video switcher to accommodate multiple component video  sources, or you could sacrifice some picture quality and use S-Video  connections instead.","Date":"December 15, 1999"}
{"Title":"Excellent Choice","Author":"Naim Hasan (naimh@mtrx.com)","ReviewID":"R3RCUYE8QSS9LZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was recently in the market for a larger screen TV set.  The 32 to 36 screen was going to be the perfect size given my family room deminsions. I was considering the Sony WEGA XBR, Toshiba, and Misubishi. Then one day as  I walked through one of the retail stores in my area, I saw the Sony 43'  Rear Projection Set.  The compact size, the Larger Viewing Screen, Picture  Quality, Enhance Digital Features and The Price, were very impressive.  My  search was over.  It's been a week since the TV was delivered to my home  and I can truly say that it has been a wonderful experience.There are a  couple of things to be aware of:  * Getting all the components connected  can take a little time.* Limited space in the Stand for adding  components.Overall I think Sony 43' is a great investment if your  considering 32 to 36\" TV's. You'll get excellent picture quality at a  better price point.","Date":"March 14, 2000"}

{"Title":"Studio dwellers - there is hope!","Author":"\"vachicago\"","ReviewID":"R1GCR9R88GZDTZ","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a GREAT TV!  The picture (depending on source) is phenomenal.  The size (video picture and physical object) does not overwhelm you.  The TV can be viewed comfortably without being on a TV stand.  The design of  the TV & remote is excellent.  I had an opportunity to view this model  in a store, and my eyes were drawn to its picture quality (and I had to  remind myself of its physical size).This TV fits well in a room size  13x13.  It can be viewed comfortably even sitting a couple of feet from it.  There are five picture modes, 2 of which can be programmed to the viewer's  preference.  Because of its size, widescreen movies are enjoyable (before,  when choosing a video as either VHS or DVD, I would pick VHS if the DVD was  in widescreen format).  There are 4 video displays, three of which can be  programmed to accept 8 different components.Sony has included a lot of  programming choices in this model.  Connecting a receiver, VCR and DVD (and  getting them to work) took about 4 hours.  The TV needs to be off when  connecting a component.  Each component should be added one at a time,  rather than plugging & connecting everything at once and then turning  the TV on.  Apparently the TV needs to 'read' each component before it's  recognized.  The manual was somewhat confusing (because there are usually 2  to 4 combinations to use), but after a component was added you just follow  from the previous example for additional components.  P.S.:  the more  components you add, the more every cable & power cord needs to be  labeled.The remote is comfortable to handle.  There are problem with it  though: 1) in order to use a component, more than just one button needs to  be pressed; 2) you still need to use the remote that came with the  component.This can easily replace a 27-inch to 36-inch TV.  It weights  ~150 pounds and the footprint is small (20 D x 37 W x 42 H).  As the source  of the picture increases in quality, especially from the local TV stations,  this model will be enjoyed more and more.  Then a viewer will have a true  movie experience at home.I chose this TV based on: 1) picture quality;  2) video size & physical size; 3) design; 4) price [remember what you  paid for your current computer? It will outlast it! ] If you can find a  vendor, buy it!  Do not wait!  It will be the best investment!","Date":"December 14, 1999"}
{"Title":"A good TV for small rooms","Author":"Richard J Kelly","ReviewID":"RY52X7FDHB3K9","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased my TV about a week ago.  The picture quality is very good, most people think it is a direct TV not projection. The built in screen protector gives the picture more clarity.  And the TV definently  benefits from a digital source such as satellite tv.  Hooking it up is  somewhat confusing if you have a number of components.  For the money I  don't think you could find a TV of this size with better picture quality.  My only complaint is not with the TV, but with the optional matching stand.  The stand is pretty much useless if you have more than two components.  You cannot put two components side by side because the stand is not wide  enough.  And even after removing the shelf, it is not tall enough to stack  components on top of each other.  The stand needs to be about 3\"  taller and 4\" wider.  Sony's designers obvivously did not put a lot of  thought into the stand when it comes to function.","Date":"January 22, 2000"}

The set is in a nice, compact case, and the cabinet (extra, fits under the  TV) available has room for a DVD, VCR, Tuner, and Cable Box, making all of  those components fit in a neat presentation, without, wires and boxes  hanging off the set.

{"Title":"Too much of a good thing?","Author":"Amy E. Jones","ReviewID":"R218RS8136KCTL","Overall":"good","Content":"This set is surprisingly good in the following ways:After owning this set for four months, I am astonished at how BAD other televisions look. When my friend bought a 32 inch WEGA (non XBR) and had us over to take a look, I was appalled by the overdriven picture, extensive red push and large gap between scan lines. It was like watching television through a set of venetian blinds. The same with another friend's Toshiba flat tube set.Further, if you're a gadget-type person. you'll appreciate the fantastically in-depth service menu. Every conceivable internal setting of the television can be accessed through the remote. We have dropped the red push altogether and the picture is considerably more pleasing than when the set was new.Finally, the resolution of the picture tube is so much better than standard televisions that flaws, edits, and manipulations in NTSC sources can easily be detected with the naked eye. This could be a turn-off for some casual owners; other television sets are too blurry and inaccurate to reveal the flaws in a broadcast. Not the XBR! With this set, the difference between high quality and inferior broadcasts is as plain as day.To sum up, this television is superior in every way. In fact, its superiority makes some common NTSC programming look pretty bad. Some owners won't like it, preferring to hide the flaws in the signal by watching through an inferior set.","Date":"April 19, 2002"}

The XBR series absolutely blew me away at 25 ft.  The difference was even more astounding the closer I got.  Nothing, not even the other Sony WEGA models compared to the XBR.  I had to stick my face to within serval inches from the screen in order to notice the razor thin horizontal scan lines. I wasn't really planning on spending that much on a TV but I did not hesitate for a moment to reach for my check book for the XBR. With a little bargaining, I think I got mine for about...  I've had it now for almost a year and I still marvel at quality of this unit. It has more AV I/Os than most users will ever need (component, s-video, and composite) 6 in all.  I even replaced a fairly new DVD player for a model that had progressive scan so I could take advantage of the 480p feature of the XBR (\"fabulous\").  Also, my new XBOX (w/ the HD AV kit) really looks super on the XBR too.Go, shop, compare, see for yourself.  I think only the LCD HDTVs have a better picture quality but they're still too expensive and have very little content to offer today and, I think It'll be a while before they do. So, 4:3 is still the way to go.  Besides, the XBR is HDTV ready.  I just wish that I could have bought the 36\" XBR but it wouldn't fit into my entertainment center.","Date":"December 19, 2001"}

I wasn't intending on buying this TV when I went shopping but once I saw the picture and other features compared to the \"regular\" flat screen TV's I had to have it.  The picture's incredible, the colors are perfect and the skin tones are right on the money.  I havent hooked it up to a home theater system yet but the TV audio on its own is wonderful.  I connected a DVD player that has the progressive scan feature (only works with HDTV TV's) and I used the component video cable connection.  All I can say about the picture quality while watching a DVD is WOW!!!!  It's crystal clear.  It was just like being in a movie theater except that my recliner is much more comfortable and the picture was actually better.  The picture-in-picture feature is better than any I've seen.  It's called Twin-View and instead of a small box in the corner of the screen it comes up in a split screen so both channels take up half the screen.  Then you can resize either one you want and as one gets bigger the other gets smaller.  You can also use the picture-in-picture mode while viewing a DVD, VHS, video game system or any other input you have hooked up.  There are also plenty of in-put jacks (6) so you can hook up just about anything you want.  Overall it's just the best TV I've seen.  The ONLY reason I didnt give it 5-stars is because of the price.  I paid the same price thats advertised here but I got the stand included.  Oh ya and it's HDTV (ready) so when all broadcasts go over to HDTV in a few years you'll be all set.

Coupled with a progressive scan DVD player (we have the Sony DVP-NS700P, also a great product), the picture is nothing short of amazing. Even VHS tapes look better with this TV, thanks to the line-doubling up-conversion process the signal goes through. The sound quality is also excellent--even has treble/bass adjustments--and has surprising bass output for a TV set. The picture-and-picture feature (scalable side-by-side twin views) is really cool; however, be aware that you won't be able to view two channels at once if you get satellite service. (You can still view different sources simultaneously, though.) The unit also has plenty of inputs, including two component video inputs (for high-definition sources) so you can hook up a DVD player as well as an HDTV receiver. While the price is high, for the quality, features and flexibility, you can't beat this Sony for 32\" models. I would recommend this TV to anyone who can afford it.","Date":"March 11, 2002"}

{"Title":"Exceptional HDTV and Progressive Scan DVD images","Author":"Mike Wazonek","ReviewID":"R39GAO25A0TL29","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched RPTV's for over a year and my decision ended up coming down 2 RPTV's - the Philips 46PP9302 and the Hitachi 45F500, I looked at a number of manufacturers including Sony, JVC, RCA, Panasonic. My decision to go with the Philips was based on the extra video processing enhancments that come with this TV and the \"classy\" styling of this unit. As far as the picture quality goes both units provide excellent video but the Philips just seemed to provide a more stunning picture on HDTV and DVD progressive scan. The picture adjustments that can be made to tailor the picture to how \"you\" want it to look are seemingly endless - each input can be adjusted the way you want it. One other notable thing about the philips is the picture with satelitte - This is one of the few TV's with which the satelitte picture looks even good - and when it comes down to HDTV images it is downright amazing. One thing anyone should consider when buying a RPTV is the ability of the TV to provide some sort of screen protection from phosphor aging as I found out from my research there are some Tv's out there that have only lasted 3-4 years before the black bars wear into the screen. I have found that the 4.3 format is what I am using the most to view programming from satelitte so you get the black bars on either side of the screen so the black bar burn in could be a potential problem. The Philips auto format screen sizing is also one of the best available and not many of the RPTV's I looked at even had anything auto period! - you had to use the remote to fill the screen and the resulting picture was quite unporportional. Another deciding factor with purchasing this TV was the dealer I bought it from offerd me an additional 2 years parts and labor warranty as his comment was \" We have very few problems with any of the Philips TV's we sell and that's why we offer the extra 2 years\" . On the downside , (if any) this television as with most RPTVS is the viewing angle - it is very location sensitive - you need to view it sitting down and not to far off center - I have found that about 8-12 ft out and no more than 3-6 ft off center on either side is about maximum.A highly recommemded HDTV RPTV.Mw","Date":"April 18, 2003"}

{"Title":"Excellent piece of equipment","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2RQCH7XBBWG9U","Overall":"good","Content":"I've recently purchased this rear projection television and I'm very impressed to say the least. I've owned a Samsung 40 rear projection prior to this, which was also a very good TV, but nothing compared to this JVC bad boy. Some nice features include a DVI jack for future (some present) digital connections, a center channel input (although I've tried it and the sound is less than acceptable, perhaps its my receiver), numerous multiscreen displays including dual tuning for split screen, and most importantly exceptional picture quality. I believe it's the internal line doubler that creates such sharp pictures, or so they say. The clarity is really astounding for a projection TV, and what's more, the clarity is not limited to HDTV broadcasts, but the picture on regular cable is amazing as well. Let's face it, most of us do not spend most of our TV viewing time having access to HDTV broadcasts and receivers. Albeit a fortunate handful, but for the rest of us this television has excellent picture quality across the board. I highly suggest watching the Monsters Inc. dvd with a player using component connections. The clarity is breathtaking, many picutres truly appear to be 3 dimensional. But instead of relying solely on reviews, go out to your local electronics store, and take a look for yourself at this television against other manufacturers. And don't listen to large chain store electronics sales employees, they don't know what they're talking about. Happy shopping!","Date":"December 3, 2002"}
{"Title":"JVC AV-48WP30","Author":"Ronald Gmiterek","ReviewID":"R74YGVBD2F7QO","Overall":"good","Content":"Just got it on Saturday July 13, 2002.The picture is amazing. The only downfall is, to have that amazing picture, you have to watch DVD's. I have BEV as a satellite supplier. Most of the channels are clear, except for some, it seems the picture is too big for the channel.Now, I've upgrade from a 10 year old JVC 27\" (Best TV I've ever had). The picture just looks huge, I'm sitting approx. 11 feet away. The ideal viewing distance is suppose to be 9.5 feet.It's just so huge. Now, that may just be because I upgraded from a lot smaller to a lot bigger TV.I've watched approx. 10 movies on it, and WOW, I would never be able to watch them on anything else (unless it's bigger).Other little tidbits, is that when the movie is in letterbox (2.35:1), you still have the black lines on the top and the bottom. You can zoom in even more, but then you lose some of the picture. (my wife is very disapointed with this).To use the full screen when you are watching a 4:3 tv show or movie, the picture seems a little bit stretched, just takes a little of getting use too.If you are watching the TV from angles greater than 30 to 40 degrees, you really can't see very much.Besides what I've mentioned, it is a great TV for a great price, and a big plus, you can use the speakers for the Center channel of your receiver.I've also played my PS2 and XBox on it, it just blows your mind how detailed the games are now.I'm also having a technician coming in to make all the fine tuning on the TV (I don't want to lose the warranty, if I do it myself). So I will let you know if it makes it even better.I would give this TV a four and a half star, it lost its half a star because of the things I've mentioned above. And that is an assesment based on three days of having it. Give me a year, and I'll let you know if it has improved.","Date":"July 15, 2002"}

{"Title":"Excellent TV for being an 'early' HD model.","Author":"Ed Hurtley \"geek\"","ReviewID":"R2FZ3FRH0W8OZB","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought one of these used.  It is my first HDTV (not counting watching HD TV through my computer.)As these reviews are almost all from when the TV was new, I figured I would write a review from the current perspective.First, the downsides:It only handles 1080i, not 1080p.  Plenty for everything I've thrown at it; but those who have Blu-ray may want a 'real' 1080p TV.It has two 1080i-compatible component connections, and one DVI.  No HDMI; although the DVI port works just fine connected to my HDMI-output HD DVD player via an HDMI to DVI cable.It has dual (now obsolete) NTSC tuners, but no digital ATSC tuner.  Therefore, the tuner is essentially useless.The picture-in-picture can handle two HD inputs, but it can be a little flaky.It is a rear-projection TV, which means that it has a rather limited viewing angle.  The picture looks great as long as your eyes are level with the top of the screen or lower, but playing Wii games that require standing up on it are difficult, because the picture dims very quickly when viewed from above.  Likewise, the sideways viewing angle is about 90° to be at full brightness.  It drops off quickly thereafter.Now, the upsides:Finding one used can be cheap.  Potentially significantly cheaper than a new HDTV.The CRT-based projection system means that it doesn't have a high-power light bulb to burn out.  The one I bought is now six years old; and the picture is very bright. (when viewed from proper angles.)In spite of the admonitions that the DVI port isn't computer-compatible, it works perfectly with my MacBook Pro.  It supports 720p, or 1080i; with excellent picture reproduction.But, the DVI port does not have sound, so even through an HDMI adapter, you still have to use analog stereo audio (or use a receiver.)The picture looks wonderful, wether from an ATSC tuner (in a VCR/DVD Recorder, connected via component,) HD DVD, computer, or Wii.The sound, while only stereo with faked surround, is good.  I have found no need to re-connect my receiver.  Good volume, good tone, and enough bass.","Date":"August 8, 2009"}

{"Title":"Would give it ZERO stars if that were an option...","Author":"M. Wolford","ReviewID":"R318XU73QMK0MU","Overall":"bad","Content":"We purchased this television in April 03 and loved everything about it until  a year and 3 months later.  As we were watching t.v. one night, all of a sudden we heard a loud pop and the screen went blue.  My husband got the manual out and tried to get it working but to no avail.  Unfortunately, I did not buy the extended warranty because I thought that it was covered for more than a year.  I called JVC and was told that I would have to call and have it repaired myself.  We ended up having to send it to a shop and paid an extra $500.00 for the repair.  I was more than upset because in my opinion, when you purchase a $1600.00 television, it should last longer than a year before needing repair unless you damage it yourself, which we did not.  The receipt for the repair says they had to replace an output and install a CRT insulator kit.  I swore then that I would never buy another JVC product again, but was at least glad that our t.v. was working again.  Now, two and a half years later, it is going out AGAIN.  This is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent and I am so disappointed with JVC.  I am not usually one to write reviews, as a matter of fact, this is the first I have ever done, but I felt compelled to do so because I am so disgusted.  For those of you who have already purchased, I hope that you never have to go through the ordeal that we have had to go through.  For those of you considering purchasing, I would look into buying another brand.  Instead of wasting another $500 to have this t.v. fixed for maybe another two years, we are just going to buy another t.v.","Date":"March 4, 2007"}

I purchased my TV in Nov of 2002.  It had to have a part replaced in Feb 2003!  Of course, it had to go in the shop for two weeks until the part they ordered was received.In all, there have been about 5 service calls, with 2 trips to the shop.First, the TV would shut itself off.  No, I didn't have the AutoOff function turned on.  Then we noticed the clock was way off all the time (it would lose several minutes a day).  Then, sometimes when we turned the TV on, there would be sound with no picture.  We had to unplug the TV for several minutes, then try again.Finally, after all that, the TV appeared to be fine, until recently when we noticed the menu would go all pink.  The picture was fine, just the menu was off.  I was afraid this was a symptom of a larger problem, so I made yet another service call.  Once again, the TV is in the shop, and has been since Dec 1st.Now my initial warranty period is over.  I expressed concern to JVC but, in typical fashion, they spouted the company line.Question:  how many times does the TV have to break before JVC realizes that they sold me a lemon and should replace it?Warning:  never buy from JVC.  They are crap.","Date":"December 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"One word...WOW","Author":"\"greatone222\"","ReviewID":"R292N4RT7WJMZ6","Overall":"good","Content":"I shopped for a new 36 inch TV for 2 weeks. I went out to 4 different stores and looked at all the new models, from JVC, to Panasonic, to sony WEGA and XBR. I finally decided on THIS TV. The Model # is Fv300. This is the 2nd model down, (below HDTV) in the WEGA 36 inch line. The features such as infared headphones, picture in picture, \"WoW\" sony simulated surround sound, and a 3D DIGITAL COMB, as opposed to 3 line digital, which appears in almost all average price TV's. The 3D Digital does make a difference, and only beging in WEGA in the Fv300. There are two S video connectors (1 rear, 1 front), and plenty of A/V jacks in the rear (19 of them). Heres the catch, the stand. It cost me 219.00 bucks. Im not sure how much you can find it for, but that is the proper WEGA stand, custom made by SONY for this TV. Let me say...it is one SOLID stand and LOOKS like its worth over 200 dollars. It really does make the presentation. The cheapest quality stand you could find will still run between 99.99 and 169.99 anyway. So I suggest doing as I did, and just going for it. Another issue is the weight of this thing. It's easily 240lbs, some websites claim its more. If you plan on taking this home, your gonna need someone with an SUV or a truck, the box is enormous. I would suggest getting it delivered so you can have them put it right on the stand for you. Me and my brother are weightlifters, so we didnt have too much of a problem getting it in and on the stand , but I would suggest ATLEAST 3 strong people. All the weight is in the front, too. When your past all the setting up, your gonna be happy with your TV. The audio out connection is easy for a home theatre system. I connected a Sony system, and Im attempting to dual connect Klipsch 5.1's. So youve read about the TV, what are the differences in the different models of 36 inch WEGA? FS100- basic model, cheapest, no PIP, No 3d digital comb, No Tru surround sound...basically lacks important features.FS200- Adds PIP, and other basic features, but very similar to the FS100.FV300- This is the model I bought. PIP, 3D digital comb, free infared headphones (which allow you to listen to TV from a distance), etc etc etc...it's loaded.FV500- HDTV model, includes all features of the Fv300, but adds the somewhat \"gimmicky\" HDTV feature. It looks nice but you'll need an HDTV sattalite connection, or some other form to use it. ALso, not all stations broadcast HDTV. It is TV of the future, but its not here yet. Save the 500 bucks. Sony XBR- A step above WEGA, HDTV capable, and 40 inch. Runs double the price of the FV300.Ok, I just wanted to provide you with some insite after my purchase. I'm happy with the Fv300, and I know I made the right choice. Cant beat SONY, Trinitron, and WEGA all in one. I've got two trinitron computer monitors and I was SOLD on the TV just as quickly. They are the best.","Date":"November 24, 2002"}

I can't say enough good things about the KV-36FV300.The picture quality is outstanding. The filtering creates an image that will amaze you. Lines of resolution are almost unnoticeable and dot-crawl is minimal. We hooked up our digital cable with S-Video and the picture is excellent. I even saw a hint of pixelization during movement on one of the digital channels. This is of no concern because we don't have the HD converter box, but that shows how close this set comes to HDTV.Used the component hook-up for our DVD player. WOW!!! You can get buy with S-Video here but you'll not acheive what this TV can do for you. (Pay a little extra for the component cables!) Sony allows you to select either a 16x9 enhanced mode or Auto for widescreen dvd's and I've found the auto mode allows a bigger picture in widescreen with no sacrafice in picture quality. There are multiple sound and video modes fore each input to tailor each program, so you don't have to mess with settings constantly. Once you get the Clear Edge VM (velocity modulation) and the DynaBlack settings set the TV never stops blowing you away.The sound is impressive! It has a 15-watt subwoofer for deep bass when using just the tv speakers, but I prefer my Yamaha theatre system most of the time. The wireless headphones were a nice surprise! The quality is better than expected but the range is limited. These are great for watching those late night games when everyone's asleep. (sports fans, are you awake?)TV broadcasts through cable, particularly live sports, are simply outstanding. DVD signals are even better!!! And you can't find better sound from a TV anywhere else.Unless you want to struggle with an HDTV (at least until analog signals are outlawed),  BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!!(Advice: ...have it delivered, it's worth the money.)

THIS IS NOT A HDTV!  It will take the signal, but will have to \"dumb it down\" to display.  But that display is absolutely gorgeous: sharp colors, wide viewing angle and NO artifacts.  As for using the display as a computer monitor, I would be hard pressed to recommend it any higher.  As with all viewsonic monitors I have owned in the past, apps from word processing to the newest games are just perfect.  I connected my cable to a media center computer I built, and now use a nifty program called Snapstream that puts the old TIVO to shame!  Now my wife can tape her soaps, easily burn her favorites to DVD, check her E-Mail, surf the web, video chat with her mom, play Tetris (O.K.---she's a little behind the times in her gaming!), find that song she has been looking for, etc----all from the comfort of our bed.  She's now happy as a clam, which any guy will tell you pays the ol' hubby dividends far greater than the sub 3K cost of the unit.  And I must admit, I can't wait for Halflife II on a big monitor with the display settings jacked to the max!  Two caveats:  Again, no HDTV.  Perhaps more importantly, if you are going to set this unit up yourself, you ought be an enthusiast.  Trying the many input choices enabled me to decide on the best option for myself, which proved to be the DVI for the computer, and the S-Video for all TV functionality except for DVD playback, which benefits with progressive scan connections (you know, that red blue yellow thingy).  If you rely on the manual alone, you are apt to be left confused, as it is far too brief and poorly written.  If you feel, as I do, that the PC is the future engine to drive home entertainment, this unit is an excellent partner!","Date":"February 3, 2004"}

That's why Plasma's are considered monitors instead of T.V.'s  What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50% of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up, or what others call the RF adapter.  Regular T.V.'s can make up for this signal loss plasma's can't.  So for all you out there do some research before you buy a Plasma.","Date":"October 17, 2005"}

Biever","ReviewID":"RFG5M1X9IWQHN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Note: I would rate this product and company with zero stars if given the option!Do not buy this TV.  I owned another Tatung television  and tried to have it repaired under warranty.  The TV, however, must be shipped to the company for repair - at the customer's expense.  So their warranty requires $200+ right off the bat.  So after my first disappointing experience with their customer service, the set quit altogether.  Of course, the warranty period had expired now, but we still had only owned the TV for 2 years.  I contacted customer service again and was told I could have it repaired by shipping it to them and paying a mere $700.  So instead of wasting my money repairing this lemon, I plan to take my money and purchase a TV from a reputable company like LG.Congratulations to those of you who enjoy and appreciate the products and service of the Tatung corporation.  The rest of us suckers now realize we should not waste money on their rubbish.","Date":"July 10, 2007"}

I bought my Tatung TV about a year and a half ago. Mine was actually a bigger one than this one but same brand. Right from the begining it had problems with the screen going out whenever it had an all white background on whatever show or commercial we were watching. I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves. I would NOT buy anything from this brand ever again. Try Goodwill, you will probably get more for your money.","Date":"July 5, 2007"}

LCD, plasma, and LED flat-screens just weren't easily available or too costly.  That was 2003.I expected this TV, like most CRT technology TVs, to last for at least 15-20 years.  It didn't.  That's a complete and utter failure by Sony as CRT should easily last decades.As to the performance - it was great sound and picture when it worked.  I have no complaints about the actual performance.  There just wasn't enough of it.That brings me to the real issues.  1) It's impossible to reliably repair.  2) Repairs are expensive even though the parts themselves are under $100 - Sony service is too costly and doesn't come with any useful warranty.  3) This TV is a monster to move or get rid of.  It's 325lbs just for the TV.  The stand adds another 100-ish lbs.  Getting rid of this takes a team of people.

Within a year it failed to turn on (makes clicks, flashes the standby light, but does not turn on).  Being under warranty, Sony sent a team of guys (yes, it's that heavy) to load it onto the repair truck.  The unit was repaired, but failed again (this time the warranty was expired) with the same symptoms.  Turns out the reps replaced the defective components with new components, which are plagued with this problem. A quick search on any major search engine for \"Sony Trinitron Flash Error Codes\" will reveal a vast consumer base plagued with this problem.  There is no permanent fix as the parts needed to fix it are themselves the problem; any parts replaced will eventually result in the same failures due to the problem being in the defective part design and/or manufacturing process.  Sony is aware of this, and is probably thankful the warranties on these units has run out.Do not buy this unless you have a team of guys to move it to a place where you intend to throw it away after it fails.

The only regret is not buying it sooner! In fact, so impressed am I with the picture and the sound that I have already recommended it to a friend who is in the mkt for a new tv. After some research of his own and his own personally conducted \"eye-ball\" test, he came the same conclusion and purchased the set 1 wk after my recommendation. I believe the HD microfocus lens and picture tubes really work to produce a superb picture -- such that it's hard to believe that it's rear-projection and not the standart CRT which are purported to be clearer, but that in this case it's not! Also, the $3000CAD that we paid included the tv stand which makes it a great value when compared to other rptvs of this size. I watch only cable tv on this set and I am still amazed at the picture. I also watch DVDs on progressive scan and am very happy with the PERFECT picture -- which goes to show what it's capable of, given a superior signal.

Watching sporting events in HD is like having a seat inside the stadium / arena(This set is a football lover's dream. ESPN HD is the coolest!). We looked at a bunch of different models, including some of the bigger screens, but this one is just the perfect size for us, and the Sony was the most highly recommended by salespeople(they always noted how busy repair guys were with some of the other models). A good store will have HD pumped in on all their TVs to help with deciding which unit has the best picture. The Sony was sharp, the sound was good, and the remote was easy to learn. Also, watching DVDs with the progressive scan is like going to the movies. With the different audio and video setups, multiple inputs(including a convenient front input), and universal remote(included), you'll be very pleased with this set, whether you're watching the latest movie on DVD, catching the playoffs, or watching your favorite show in HD.

The picture and sound was impressive.  Moving it around was easy as it is not as heavy as it looks.  The manual was easy to read and connecting everything I had on it was simple.  As the years went by I began to notice that the left and right side stayed brighter than the center of the screen giving it the appearance of a layer of film over the screen which was not pleasant to the eyes.  I opened it which I do not recommend you do but I am electronically trained and the parts are very sensitive and can be dangerous to tamper with without little knowledge in electronics.  I dusted of the mirror and screen and gently wiped the 3 lens inside with a professional cleaning agent and the t.v. was back at it's original performance that I was able to enjoy for 8 yrs now until the convergence chips went out on it just yesterday :(  I love the t.v. so much and it has been with me for so long that I ordered the parts to repair it myself and hope to keep it another few years before I am able to save up enough money for a larger better t.v. in the future.

Having started out leaning towards the bigger name brands the service tech did a fine job trying to keep me in the higher priced models.  I'm not sure who wore who out.  As I read more about the different models I found them to be very similar in their offerings, however, I kept leaning towards not what the descriptions said, but where I felt it mattered most, in the visual presentation of the picture I saw.  I also found that visual presentation to be equally as personal.  I asked others (in the showroom) their opinion and no surprise, I got as many differences as there were people.  For example, I viewed some that looked to be naturally lighter and some darker and some with the hues more sedate than others that were more brilliant. We all saw them differently, yet the specs were all the same.  My decision to buy this Samsung plasma screen wasn't scientific, I bought it because I've had great success with Samsung products in the past and I found the picture to be as pleasing as the more expensive models.  With the money I saved, I upgraded to the Bose audio system and still had plenty of money left to buy DVDs and the popcorn to go with them.  I would strongly recommend this plasma screen and feel confident that you made the right decision.

I originally had a used Daewoo plasma from sams club and it sucked big time, heated up the room like crazy, and constantly had ghosting. I returned it at sams club and bought a samsung spn4235 at circuit city because they had a promotion (2,700 dollars) plus a 300 dollar gift certificate. They were getting rid of the model to get in new ones. The only thing I was let down about was it was EDTV but I found out HDTV models were a heck of a lot more expensive. When I first got the model it had this weird clayface effect and the picture wasn't what I expected however I adjusted the settings with Avia home theatre setup and I was very impressed with dvd picture. I thought this was as good as it was going to get but recently I ordered HDTV through dish network. I thought the standard channels looked like crap but I was able to set my settings at 1080i and 16:9 and hdtv channels were amazing. The picture was very lifelike and colorful and it fit my whole screen without stretching. I watched the discovery channel and the DNIE option is great for hdtv viewing. The unit does decent with blacks but not the best. The set definitely can provide a great picture but every tv can only provide as good a picture as the source it gets from. My suggestion is if you go hdtv use either component or dvi and avoid svideo and rca cables. The price is great and if your looking to save money and have a good picture I recommend the unit. There is a slight buzzing noise but I haven't noticed it. Don't bother with the side speakers go with surround sound it will enhance your experience much more. Overall a very good unit and I am definitely not disapointed.","Date":"January 25, 2005"}

I too have looked at many plasmas in the stores and compared.  I have to say this one has a beautiful picture.  Compared to true HDTV plasmas in the store, this EDTV has a great picture.  It is hard to spend the extra money for subtle differences that are hard to see even side-by-side.  Most of our viewing is cable or DVD movies so I can't rationalize the extra money. Even with a cable input, the picture is great.  It is clear and has little \"noise\" or \"graininess\" considering it is a cable signal.  Friends come over and remark what a great picture.  Internal amp for speakers is fine.  The Virtual Dolby does give good impact to the 2 speaker sound.  For DVD's I use my separate surround sound system.  One thing Samsung forgot on this model are audio output jacks to connect internal tuner sound to your surround sound system.  So many other inputs, I don't know why they forgot those outputs.This is one of the few Plasmas that comes with a 2 year warrenty in home!

{"Title":"Excellent value, good first plasma","Author":"Joel Risberg \"Geek\"","ReviewID":"R2SVYKUFSQ1KEI","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this TV via Amazon in 2004 and have been very pleased overall. At the time it was one of the cheapest 42\" plasmas available at around $2800, and now it can be had new for closer to $1500 thanks to the rapid developments in plasmas. If, like us, you don't have HDTV service or immediate plans to upgrade, it's a good choice. DVDs look excellent and standard channels (we use DirecTV and Tivo) look as good as they possibly could.Keep in mind, though, that this isn't a top of the line and will have some trade-offs. Most notably, the resolution is not true HD even though the TV can accept all HDTV formats and will display them at its own maximum resolution. Also, there are no built in speakers or HDTV tuner, but this isn't an issue when most people will use the unit with a surround system and cable box/satellite receiver. We route all our video sources (DirecTV, DVD, VCR, video game) through a $300 Sony surround system that routes the video into a single cable to the TV and the audio to 6 satellite speakers. If you have HDTV service the set does support the DVI connector but not HDMI, so you may need an adapter.She set emits an audible buzz that's loudest when the unit first turns on, but never goes away fully. It does not have a noisy internal cooling fan, though, as some early plasmas did. The set also radiates a lot of heat and draws a large amount of power -- more than 350 watts according to the specifications.Many people mistakenly fault plasmas like this one for premature burn-in when what they're noticing is only temporary. If you see the shadow of a previous image on the TV you need only watch something else for a few minutes and it's gone.Picture quality will be astounding for those upgrading from a standard CRT TV like us, but it's not perfect. Darks lack clarity and night scenes are often hard to make out. Bright scenes look excellent. We watch standard TV in the \"Panorama\" mode, which gradually stretches the square image to fit the rectangular screen. We prefer this to watching with gray (not black) bars on the sides of the image, but that mode is available too. DVDs will display in full 16x9 widescreen mode and look beautiful.","Date":"September 26, 2006"}

I've had this set for 2 years and have come to learn is does have problem. When you adjust the volume, an image of a volume bar appears on the screen. Over time, this image will burn itself on the screen. Make sure and select a set that lets you turn off the volume control image or moves it around on the screen to avoid screen burn-in.After weeks of reading about HDTV I came to the conclusion that eventually, you simply must make a choice and go with it. I feel like a made the right choice with this set. Viewing DVDs, the image quality looks every bit as good as I remember seeing it in a theater on the big screen. Older movies don't look quite as good but then again, they don't look bad either. For example, a new movie like X-men 2 is stunning while an older movie like Silverado is not quite as crystal clear. One nice surprise, regular cable TV looks very nice and the settings on the set allow you to display \"normal\" 4:3 format in the wide-screen mode with little notice of distortion.  The back of the set offers many connection options. While the set is heavy, it comes with hidden casters that make it easy to move. I was somewhat concerned about the condition of the set on the day it was delivered as it was freezing cold and I worried that might harm the set. I let it adjust to room temp before I powered it up but the convergence was fine. Right out of the box I was totally pleased with the picture quality.I want to add that my set came fully assembled.

The sound was also excellent - the best I've heard from any projection TV without using a Home Theater system.  However, I purchased mine as a \"factory reconditioned\" product which had not been repaired properly and still had a problem when it was shipped to me.  I've since returned it to the vendor and am awaiting a credit on my card. Once the credit is received, I plan on purchasing this model once again because it is a great TV.  I've compared it to other brands in its price range and also some much higher priced and still prefer this Toshiba.  This time, however, I'll purchase through Amazon, brand new, not reconditioned.  By the way, the set comes in a big box, which is cut open, removed and then you have a FULLY ASSEMBLED TV which gets plugged in.  IT DOES NOT COME IN PIECES.  Toshiba is not selling \"puzzle piece TVs.\" The guy who says it comes in pieces is either in need of treatment or has a gripe against Toshiba.","Date":"March 23, 2004"}
{"Title":"excellent quality, superior value","Author":"Orlando \"mcmachete\"","ReviewID":"RUKP77LNU9RL6","Overall":"good","Content":"Back when I purchased this TV, I installed and repaired home theater systems and home electronics. I currently work in the TV industry in Hollywood. I know my TVs. I know picture quality.After EXTENSIVE research on HDTVs and widescreen projection televisions, I bought the Toshiba 51H83. Just do yourself a favor and visit a local electronics store and see for yourself: the picture quality is crisp and vibrant and it stands out head and shoulders above all other rear-projection TVs. While most rear-projection TVs tend to be dark and difficult to watch from angles not directly in front of the TV, Toshiba's proprietary technology is much more forgiving and provides a more immersive experience.Also, the sound quality of the speakers is fantastic. They have great depth and range (something uncommon with most TVs) thank to SRS WOW, which makes a mere 20-watts-per-channel over achieve. I own a 700-watt surround sound system that I now combine with the TV's excellent speakers, thanks to the ability of the TV to use its speakers as the center channel when in surround sound mode.And it, of course, has all the features you would come to expect from a high-end TV (PIP, etc.).I reserved writing a review until I used it for some time, and after almost a year, I'm as in love with it as I was the first day I bought it.Disregard the reviewer who gave it one star, the television comes completely assembled, unless, of course, you buy from the same guy that sells cigarettes from his trunk.","Date":"November 16, 2004"}

Although it theoretically handles 1080i, it's too fuzzy to usefully perceive much more than 720p in practice.The biggest problem I have with this TV is actually a significant design flaw.  Apparently, Toshiba thought they would be cute and put the remote control sensor inside the TV, behind the projection screen.  That's fine if you're using a remote control from across the room.  However, if you want to set up any sort of hardwired remote control system (e.g. a computer controlling all the hardware in your entertainment system), you're kind of stuck because any placement of the IR transmitter that actually works also blocks part of the the screen.  The only real option appears to involve drilling a hole in the TV and putting the transmitter inside somewhere.  This falls squarely under the category of \"clever tricks that seemed like a good idea at the time\".  Guess it's time to drill, baby, drill.  *sigh*","Date":"February 4, 2012"}

First off, know that you have to assemble this television.  What?  Are you kidding you ask?  NO!  You have to assemble this television.  I bought the tv from my local Rex electronics store and I took it home expecting to be able to watch it that night, but it was in the box in pieces.  I called the salesman at the store and asked him what had happened, I figured it was an error, but he said that was the reason the price on the tv was so low.  Toshiba is cutting labor costs by putting the tv parts in a box and I have to assemble it like prefab furniture.  Un-Freaking-Believable!  I have to figure out this diagram with lenses and mirrors and somehow manage to put the whole thing together with my own tools.  I finally got it put together and everything is captioned in Japanese.  The audio works fine, but there are Japanese characters all over the screen that, as best as I can tell, are subtitles.  They do not appear during commercials, only during a network broadcast so I can only guess they are subtitles as I don't understand Japanese and cannot imagine what else they could be.  Again a phone call to the Rex and again the standard \"you got the tv cheap, what do you expect?\"  Lastly, I cannot watch anything after 8 p.m. on this tv.  If I try to watch tv after this hour, it will play for 2 or 3 minutes and then a message comes up on the screen, in english this time, suggesting that \"It is late.  Why don't you spend time with your family?\" and then it shuts off.  I have no family.  What else do I have besides television to keep me company?  I tried taking the television back and the people at the store told me that because I had assembled the tv poorly, they would not take it back.  I am now stuck with the tv.  I have denied the charge on my credit card and called Toshiba to see if they will assist in this matter as I have been completely screwed.  I will post again on this forum if I get any more information.","Date":"February 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"BIG TV, has all the current features, user friendly","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R24YCNQPVYMDJM","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is a strong solid performer.  It's Consumer Report Magazine's #1 ranked projection TV.  It has all the up to date features a HDTV needs ... it has the DVI option for HDTV, has Component Inputs for your DVD player, has S-Video for your satellite or similar, has several standard A/V inputs for your VCR or game system, etc.,.  It has everything you need for your basic entertainment system.  Additionally the picture quality is one of the best for a projection system.  But be weary of that concept, this TV is huge...57\", and with this amount of size, the picture quality on \"smaller\" objects is not going to be super crisp or sharp using even a satellite digital feed.  But that holds true on all TVs this big...I think.  So for example when watching basketball and you get the half court view the players are not real super sharp ... you can't really see those little details like face features, etc.,.  You know it's KOBE but you can't pick up the eyes, etc.,.  But for \"regular\" shows that usually don't have such small images, it's wonderful.  Toshiba has made the remote and TV use very easy and user friendly.  You can easily access video 1,2,3,4 etc.,. for the various electronic components you have.  So all good.  BUT ... one drawback was the amount of time it took for delivery from Amazon.  It took a month although the initial advertised estimate was 1 to 2 weeks.  I notice now, though, it says 1 to 2 days, but I notice it's coming from J&R not Amazon and the shipping jumped like $200 so maybe that isn't an issue now.

This is what motivated us to purchase this TV even though we had read alot of negative feedback from buyers who experienced breakdowns soon after purchase and long waits for part replacement.  We shrugged off those reviews by rationalizing that out of the thousands of people who buy this TV, probably only the ones with a bad Toshiba experience take the time to write one.  One week after buying the Toshiba however I turned on the TV and when the screen just showed solid green I had the sinking feeling I should have listened to the nay sayers a little more closely.  It is two months later and all I get is \"the part should be shipping Monday and then it will be 3-5 business days after that\" followed by \"I'm sorry sir, the part should be shipping Wednesday\", and finally, \"It's not going out this week but we show it should be shipping on Monday\".Toshiba customer service was unable to provide any help at all and they generally don't see a problem with someone spending $2000 for a T.V., using it a week, and then having them wait weeks and weeks to get it fixed.  Again, it is a great T.V. if your are willing to risk having it break and waiting months for a replacement part.  I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying a Toshiba projection TV to think twice and read some of the things other people have written.

Other than the slow shipping, when arrived, it was amazingly easy to set up, with automated focusing to line up the 3 cathode rays.  The picture is incredible.  We don't even have cable or satellite, using just an aerial antennae, and still, just an incredible picture.  The image is even viewable from side angles without much degradation of the picture.The one gripe I have is that for some unknown reason if a wrong button is hit on the remote by accident, it has changed the default input setting from antenna to cable.  Mostly a minor annoyance.  Other than that, the menus are easy to navigate and the front panel with the video 3 inputs are nice.  Component video on the back is really nice with a progressive scan DVD.  Makes a big difference!  I'd recommend it to anyone and am pleased so far with the quality from Toshiba.  Other information, we've had the tv about 3 months now with no issues, paid 1799 through Amazon directly, shipping was very slow though, took about a month and a half total.","Date":"December 9, 2003"}

Since much of the TV we all watch is not broadcast in widescreen, viewing in 4:3 is required if you don't want to add 20 pounds to every actor/actress (well, that might not be all that bad these days..) or stretch scenery to where it looks unnatural.DVD's look AMAZING, especially if you have a DVD player with a DVI output.

Definitely an improvement from the behemoth Toshiba that I had. I did do some research prior to purchasing and this is what I found.Overall everyone seems to like the pic quality. Sony is the closest competitor; if you manage to set the pic correctly there should not be any difference. Switching to satellite from cable supposedly improves pic quality. Since I bought it just yesterday, I cannot say a lot about my experience - the pic is truly great.However, some also complained about the bad Samsung customer service. Moreover, the bulb needs to be changed every 8000-10000 viewing hours and one can probably do it (according to the manual) without calling the service personnel. The bulb costs around $250. Some customers had a bad experience with the bulb within the first few months of its operation.Overall, I tend to have no regrets about the purchase and really looking forward to the experience.

{"Title":"We love it, except for the analog cable channels","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R6ZB4U8P8JCNE","Overall":"good","Content":"My wife and I had to buy a new TV to fit our living room cabinet after the big power blackout: Our 13 year old 27\" Panasonic set finally failed (The picture was beginning to buzz out prior to the black out).  We guess the set was over-taxed during the brown-out we had here in CT.  I was glad the rest of my hardware was well-isolated behind surge protectors.My wife and I were content to buy a simpler 27\" or 32\" inch set, but when we saw this set in the showroom, we both agreed we ought to buy it.  We both enjoy DVDs, and we believed we would come to enjoy the set's extra quality.  The set seemed to outperform all the other 32\" flatscreens (CRT-based) we looked at. The price was good for the features supplied too.Well.  The set just fits our cabinet (the TV has wing-like speaker panel projections), and the image quality with our CD player and VCR is stunning. We have digital cable, and for the high-number channels (those >100), we get terrific picture quality. The sound from the extra-wide cabinet's wings is also quite respectable.  This is convenient as my wife gets frustrated turning on all my assorted audio gear to produce TV sound.However, for the lower-number CATV channels, the incresed screen size makes cable signal imperfections more obvious.  I bought an exotic power conditioner for all my components to offset noise, but the CATV signal is still lousy. Apparently, with some digital CATV services, the lower-number channels are delivered in analog format and are subject to a lot of distortion.  All this makes a good case for satellite service(or a better capital improvement program by the local CATV supplier to make the system digital end-to-end...{Hope some product manager from Cox reads this some day}).The TV set also accepts memory sticks.  I have a new Sony DSCV1 digital camera, and it's fun to plug in the memory sticks and watch slide shows.The set has lots of programmable features, an easy to read manual, and a high-tech remote.  Regrettably, my CATV remote does not talk to this TV.We've had this set for a month now, and we're delighted.","Date":"September 19, 2003"}
{"Title":"Pircey, but wow!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R33XYNVERF4A3P","Overall":"good","Content":"This is by far the most I have ever spent on a TV.  But I was ready to upgrade my old set, and wanted to buy something that would allow me to eventually go HD.  This set has everything and the picture is simply amazing - HD or no HD.I orginally bought an \"HD-ready\" TV from another brand.  But I returned it because I was not sold on the quality of manufacturing (I had what apparantley is a common defect in that set).  I paid several hundred dollars more for this Sony set because I am 100% sold on the quality of Sony electronics.  So - while I wasnt happy to pay more than I needed to, all I want is to plug in the set and forget about it.  Given what these sets cost, I am fine to pay more for that peace of mind.In searching around the web, I found one review that mentioned that this set does not show non-HD tv signals well, and specifically that satellite tv signals (which is what I have) look awful.  When I first set up the tv, I had the picture mode set to \"vivid\" and did find the picture to appear quite pixelated.  I fixed this problem by connecting the satellite signal through the Monster Home Theater \"power conditioner\" and set the picture display to \"standard\" instead of \"vivid.\"  The picture is now simply amazing.  It's so good, in fact, I feel no need to hurry to upgrade to HD.Bottom-line: a bit pricey, but worth it.  You can probably get a good HD-ready set for less, but if you're going to spend in the ballpark of this set, I suggest you consider manufacturing quality along with picture quality and features.  I've never gone wrong with Sony electronics and am happy even though I paid a bit more for it.","Date":"April 11, 2004"}
{"Title":"The best video gaming TV there is. Period.","Author":"\"electrofunkchild\"","ReviewID":"R11J1JBDOPUX5H","Overall":"good","Content":"HDTVs come in many forms these days, and they can get quite confusing. LCD, CRT, Plasma, Projection... you have many options to go with if you're planning on making the HD jump. But if you're like me, and are an avid video game player (past systems to the new crop), you owe it to yourself to scoop up this TV. I have many friends that have different brands of HDTVs and I also work at an electronics refurbishing place that sees its share of TVs through its doors, I can fully attest to Sony's quality. No other brand comes close to the sheer perfection of the colors and picture on this set.First of all, please have at least 2 friends handy whenever you pick this TV up from whatever store you're buying it from because its the heaviest TV ever made. No joke. It almost gave me an instant hernia. This baby has 7 inputs of all varieties, 2 components and 1 DVI input. Being that this is a 4:3 TV, and not a 16:9 widescreen model, let it be known that your black bars will not being dissapearing from your favorite DVDs. If you're strictly a DVD buff, this TV is probably not for you. Likewise, if your into watching TV, more specifically an HDTV signal being transmitted in 720p or 1080i, this TV is ALSO not for you. Your picture will be letterboxed, not only on the tops and bottoms, but also on the sides in some cases. This is because 720p and 1080i signals are meant for 16:9 TVs and take advantage of that aspect ratio. Don't get me wrong, DVDs actually do look GREAT on this set, its just this TV is so high quality it brings out ALL the imperfections when viewing movies in progressive mode. Plasmas and the like do a better job of hiding these imperfections and smoothing out artifacts. Movies in 2.35:1 aspect ratio look especially nice on this TV, the TV itself has a great built in 16:9 enhanced mode. I tend to find movies that have lots of action and people on the screen at once, look reall good. The Lord of the Rings series and LEGEND look awesome on this TV, some of the best ones I've seen in my library of over 150 DVDs.NOW.... what this TV does do the best is the displaying of VIDEO GAMES! If you're like me and don't give a flying fudge about watching an HDTV signal, or any TV period, this is THE TV for you. Ninja Gaiden in 480p mode is quite possibly the best looking, most fluid video game that will ever grace your eyeballs. The textures used in that game in 480p JUMP off the screen and it's almost as if you can touch them. This TV feels like it has the most insane refresh rate ever, I run my computer games in 1600 x 1200 w/ a refresh rate of near 90 Hz, and this TV seems to be at least that if not higher. Everything just moves so freakin' SMOOTH. Gamecube games run w/ the component cable also look incredible (Check out Metroid Prime). Thanks to the DRC chip inside this baby, now all your older video games can also look greater than ever. The DRC claims to upconvert all 480i signals to 480p -- now I don't know if my Sega CD and Playstation are running in progressive mode, but regardless they look better than they have ever looked on a traditional CRT TV.Couple this TV with a top notch surround system, and you got yourself a killer home theater for under 2000, that would make even your friend with a 60 inch plasma drool his pants. Don't be fooled in thinking just because a 60 inch plasma is 6000 dollars that it's a superior set, because they simply are NOT, they have their uses and advantages, but most of that price tag is for the convenient thin size. Regardless of the HDTV you decide to buy, go with Sony, there is simply no substitute.","Date":"April 27, 2004"}
{"Title":"Lots of features and Amazing picture quality!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3MRM4XA7A5PB8","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this set for 6 months and absolutely love it ,The picture quality is crisp & vibrant, even my standard analog cable signal looks very good,I seriously think those who complain about its upconversion on non-hd content have signal strength issues,it is well known a weak analog signal can look horrible on any HDTV, Standard tv sets are much more forgiving about this, to be honest some channels look near DVD quality for me, I also noticed having the DRC mode set on Interlaced looks best w/ analog channels.  As for gaming you simply wont find a better 32\" in fact its the main reason I purchased it ,Gamecube & Xbox games look amazing even in the lowest progressive mode (480P),so many details that were lost on my previous analog tv are revealed with the 32HS510, thanks to its lack of visible scanlines and higher resolution tube.  If you don't have a home audio setup you wont be disappointed by the built in sound on this TV, I have a 5.1 audio setup so I wasn't really considering the sound quality when buying this TV But I was impressed by it ,the sound is clean and can be turned up loud, it's also got a built in subwoofer mounted in the rear wich delivers a decent amount of bass. I also like the 'Steady Sound' auto volume option wich attemps to keep the volume at an equal level between channel changes, commercials etc.  DVD's look superb on this set just remember its a 4:3 model so you'll still see the black bars, I'm used to this so it doesnt bother me. The best way to view dvd's is to set the dvd player on 16:9 aspect,Then on the tv options set the 16:9 Enhanced option to Auto,this way it will automaticly enable 16:9 'squeeze' when viewing widescreen content, this actualy increases the overall resolution and it looks great.Bottom line: Highly recommended OR if its to pricey you might take a look at the recently released 32HS420 model,It's a lower priced version of the HS510 with less features (lack of 2-tuner PIP,No subwoofer etc.) but supposedly it uses the same picture tube wich is a good thing =)","Date":"June 23, 2004"}

It ended up costing $350 to fix it.  I'm still not convinced that repairing it was the right move, but that's what we did.  Maybe I just expect too much from these modern day electronics.  It just seems to me that a $1300 TV should not need a repair for many years.  If I was to purchase a new TV today, I would definately not purchase this set.  It is extremely heavy and bulky.

Recently, the power on the TV shut off while I was watching the evening news.  A Circuit City technician looked at the problem and decided that one of the circuit boards needed to be replaced. After he installed that board, he decided that another circuit board was needed.  To date, he has spent nearly 5 hours working on this TV and still has not fixed it.  In the meantime, I am now going on my 12th day without the TV working, and it will likely be many more days before the new circuit board arrives since it had to be specially ordered. I use the TV only for viewing TV programs and for nothing else.

{"Title":"Not great for Standard TV: Soft, grainy, compressed","Author":"David Siegfried","ReviewID":"R2K1WK61VKR0E9","Overall":"good","Content":"This model is now discontinued but has been replaced with the very similar Sony model KV-32HS420. I purchased the last one from my local Sam's Club for $650, a great price. It is bulky and very, very heavy (176 lbs.) It nearly killed my neighbor helping me get it up a half flight of stairs. It is so big and deep that it crowds my small living room and feels too close, viewing from 6-7 feet away. After a few days, we got used to that.The picture quality in HD mode is excellent, but the reason for buying a 3:2 set is because 90% of programming is still standard definition 3:2 format, including the channels I watch most such as IFC, CNN, & Comedy Central. This TV upconverts the 420i standard TV signal to 1040i, which effectively quadruples the image density, so that you don't see large pixels. The problem is that in doing so, a lot of compression is used and the resulting picture has obvious artifacts similar to those found in highly compressed JPEGs. Many people won't notice this or won't care, but for me it's very annoying and I find myself constantly looking for the little particles and extra lines that appear in faces and particularly around text. The compression also makes SD images look softer and more grainy than on a conventional TV. I prefer my 20 year old JVC 27\" to this! Wide screen DVDs look much sharper and cleaner, possibly due to the 3:2 pulldown and/or 16:9 enhancement which allows for higher resolution from widescreen sources.If you have a large room and are going to be viewing at a  distance, this might be a good choice, as the artifacts are hard to see beyond 10 feet or so (but the images are still too soft). If you are going to be watching mostly wide screen or HDTV signals, the image is great, but then you might as well just get a 30\" - 34\" wide screen set.  It has no stretch or zoom functions, but you can view 2 sources side by side. The built-in tuner is only a standard NTSC tuner, not an HD tuner, so you can't get over-the-air HD programming out of the box, another huge drawback. I'm not fully satisfied and will probably return it.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

{"Title":"Plasma qualify without the price tag!","Author":"C. Fernandes","ReviewID":"RPSPW9T1CV40V","Overall":"good","Content":"I first saw this TV at BestBuy and was quite hooked on it. The clarity is exceptional - with a good quality signal input (HD, DVD), you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this set and an HDTV plasma.I did lots of research before finally buying it from a reputed dealer on ebay. But I found out lots about this type of TV (DLP). I won't go into details of DLP, there's a very good site for this: [...]But DLP is what makes this TV so wonderful. Remember, this really is no ordinary Rear projection TV. It has a 100W light bulb - this is the only component that needs maintenance (life span of the bulb is 8000 hrs, about 4 years). The screen does not 'age' or 'burn in' and there's no calibration of lenses, etc. So essentially, when you replace the light bulb (about $200) it's as good as a brand new TV all over again.As for the TV I purchased - it was plug and play. Simply wonderful, even with ordinary (Not digital) cable. (My cable provider is Comcast). The Tuner on the TV, even though sophisticated enough to have fine tuning, did not give as clear a picture as my Sony VCR Tuner (connected to one of the RCA inputs at the back of the TV) - so I watch cable through my Sony VCR. But it's clear enough.I use a JVC DVD player and I hooked this to one of the component inputs at the back of the TV - the picture is just awesome!The sound is not that great, but okay - the TV has this 'BBE' (Bass Enhancement) option that gives a good punch.I was able to program the remote to work both my Sony VCR and JVC DVD player, not bad!Update: I've had this TV for about 3 months before I realized that my old DVD player was not giving a progressive scan output. So I bought a new DVD player with progressive scan output and the picture is even better!Also, where inputs on this TV are concerned, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better TV. This one has it all, as listed below:1) ONE DVI input - you definitely want an HDTV with this type of input, it's the clearest form of HD signal you can get today.2) TWO High Definition component inputs (they can handle 1080i and 720p) - this is also a very high quality HD signal, but it is analog as opposed to DVI which is purely digital.3) ONE regular component input (handles only 480i).4) TWO S-Video inputs5) TWO regular (RCA jack) video inputs6) ONE VGA input used for your connecting your PC to. This is nice if you want to do a presentation from your PC using the TV as a monitor.This TV may drop in price, but is really becoming popular for obvious reasons. If you see it anywhere on sale, go ahead and buy it, I highly recommend it!","Date":"January 12, 2004"}
{"Title":"Wow!","Author":"WT \"the woodshow\"","ReviewID":"R1M793KDA0BDLL","Overall":"good","Content":"I finally took the plunge and purchased the Samsung 50\" DLP. And \"wow\" is pretty much all I can say. The picture quality is unbelievable. I finally understand why everyone is oogling over HDTV. I hooked up the DVD player (an old Sony, non-progressive scan) and I sat there dumbfounded. I started the \"testing phase\" with Apollo 13. Wow. I could tell very little difference between S-Video and Component Video, and while Component gets the slight edge, you have to be picky to care because the picture quality is outstanding either way. Hooked up the digital cable box... and again, two wows! The first wow is for how bad a standard television signal looks! It was embarrassing... I can't believe we've been watching this junk for decades! The second wow is for how much better the digital signal looks.I then ran out and upgraded my cable box to a HD box.... ok, this is a big wow! It's so good it's almost stupid. I sat there mesmerized by this almost surreal picture. Travels through Italy, Hogan's Heroes (who knew this stuff was in HD?), Three Days of the Condor, and the College World Series... it was almost like being there... actually it was better. I may never leave the house!Hookups are great. Plenty of component, s-video, and even a DVI (which I haven't used yet, although my cable box does have DVI, hard to believe the picture could be better). As integrated speakers go, the Samsung sounds great. It has a simulated surround sound mode which I tested with Apollo 13 and, while not high end surround sound, I was quite impressed. This ain't your daddy's tv speaker. Out-of-box experience was as good as it gets. It was well packed, easy to unpack, and everything worked perfectly. The remote will not win awards for revolutionary design, but it was intuitive enough for me to get to everything I needed.My only real world experience with big screen tv is my dad's Sony rear projection. What impressed me with the Samsung compared to that experienece is... you can't get too close (no tunneling), it looks great from the side, from the floor, and standing up.... you do lose a little brightness, but it's still very watchable. It's not as good as plasma, but it's not far off. One of my pet peeves with big screens is the finish on the glass... I much prefer the \"matte\" non-reflective finish of the Samsung. And when combined with the superb brightness, you can watch (and enjoy) the picture even in a brightly lit room.It wasn't easy for me to pull the trigger... I've spent the past several years of lusting over big screen televisions... never passing up the opportunity to peruse the aisles at BestBuy and Circuit City... watching the evolution from rear projection to plasma to LCD... and nothing really impressed me (ok, the plasma did impress me, but the pricetag was beyond comprehension). But there was always something that turned me off... my dad's Sony projection is cool, but when I watch a movie on it, I can see \"CNN\" and \"Live\" burned into the corners of the screen... and then I learned that you can get burn-in on plasma as well. Yikes. Then I saw the DLP... and I came close to falling in love.If you're thinking about going HD and you can afford it, you will not be dissappointed with the Samsung.","Date":"June 10, 2004"}
{"Title":"Think long term -- HD vs. SD","Author":"cotasm","ReviewID":"R2IN3OV2HDMMBO","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought the newer version of this TV (Model# HLN507W, which can also be found at Amazon) from a local store.  It was the DLP technology which sold me on it.  I brought it home, hooked it up, sat down in front of it, and turned it on.  However, I quickly saw why many people (on other sites) were giving this TV a bad review.  The biggest complaint was that a digital non-HD picture (known as standard definition or SD) didn't look as sharp as they'd hoped for a high-end projection TV.  They were right!  So, disappointed, I got up and walked away from the TV towards my wife and said, \"bad picture.\"  She replied, \"I think it looks GREAT!\"  I turned around and it DID look great!  After doing some reading, here are two very important tips that I've learned:1) Distance is key for achieving a good picture from a non-HD source!!!Even the manual gives you a mathematical way of determining appropriate viewing distance.  I've never seen anything like it.  I could see the picture falling apart if I just took a step or two inside the recommended distance, but it looked excellent otherwise.  I should probably note that the distance issue is almost eliminated when you are viewing from a HD source like a HD tuner or DVD player that has progressive output.2) Think long term!!!This TV was not built to impress those who are satisfied with a SD picture.  Any complaints about the TV that I (and most others) have had deal exclusively with a non-HD picture.  This TV's picture when viewing from a HD source is second to none!  It's far better than any plasma or LCD screen I've seen -- thanks to DLP.  The day is fast approaching when all transmissions will be in HD, and when that day arrives, then there should be NO complaints about this TV.  Its HD picture is simply stunning!","Date":"February 5, 2004"}

I also purchased Direct tv, monster cable, my wife's tv (ideal if you are really into sports - she gets hers, I get mine).  But I digress.  If I had the choice of a plasma, LCD, or DLP it would be DLP hands down.  Get the stand that goes with it and you don't have to worry about mounting anything.  It's only 85 pounds for goodness sake!  No 50 inch projection is going to weigh so little.  And if you are mounting a 50 plasma to the wall, are you sure that whoever puts it up there knows what they're doing?  Are you willing to put your $10 grand on it?  Stop reading reviews, get the DLP now.  I don't care where or how, just get the DLP.  Last words - 50 inch DLP and Bose surround sound is friggin' perfect.  We watch movies at my house!","Date":"February 28, 2004"}
{"Title":"AWESOME!","Author":"Eric W. Lampi \"ericlampi\"","ReviewID":"R1NP7UAXNKRXXS","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for 2 weeks, I am very, very satisfied.  HDTV channels are fantastic.  I have been a little skeptical thinking that I was going to find something that will disappoint me, but it hasn't, it's one of the best purchases I've made in a while.  I spent a lot of time looking at different models and types of TV, Plasma, LCD etc...  This is half the price and it looks just as good, if noo better than all but the most expensive LCD or Plasma.It's also has a 3rd generation DLP chip, so you're getting the latest and greatest technology.One thing to note, if you buy this TV and think you might want to upgrade the DVD, Samsung also makes 2 models that have DVI out, there is a remarkable difference even from component input.  They run from $200-$250, very reasonable and the results are WELL worth it!It will actually up-res the image to 1080i and process out the jaggies in the DVD.  Simply amazing.  These DVD players also have upgradable firmware.  You download it from the Samsung site, burn it to a CD-R, pop it in and it upgrades the software!  Easy to use, and well thought out.Do yourself a favor, go to a store and actually see it.  I sent back a Sony Wega because of some problems, and I have to say nothing beats a Tubed set for contrast and clarity, but this TV comes pretty close.Oh yeah, it's pretty narrow too.  About twice the depth of a Plasma, and less than half of a regular TV, AND it only wieghs 85 pounds, so most people can manage it themselves...  My 40\" Wega wieghed 300...  BLAH!Ahhh 50\" beautiful inches of Hi-Def goodness!","Date":"January 14, 2005"}

{"Title":"A good \"budget\" DLP TV","Author":"Electronix Junkie","ReviewID":"R3UPV1T01JCF1S","Overall":"good","Content":"I picked this TV up at Best Buy in November 2004, and I've been pretty pleased with it.  It's easy to set up and lightweight (approx 70 pounds), and isn't as fragile as it appears.I'm running a DVI cable from a digital cable box to this TV, and the high-definition picture is spectacular, especially for sports.  This TV only offers the 720p HD output, but I've had no difficulties with conversion from the 1080i signal.  The analog signal (non-digital channels), unfortunately, is mediocre - and certain stations that have poor signals (think TBS) look terrible.  It was explained to me that all DLP televisions have lousy analog pictures because they don't deal well with the 480i output that standard TV uses, but it doesn't matter why - just be aware that it is a problem, and if you want a very good picture across the board, this TV does not deliver it.I have a pretty high-end Sony DVD player and I'm a little disappointed in the picture from it.  I'm using good component cables and used a calibration DVD to improve the picture, but I still see a lot of artifacts and fuzziness on most DVDs.  However, I can't totally blame the TV - high-quality DVDs (The Lord of the Rings movies come to mind) do look good.  I guess the TV just doesn't do much to improve an average or lousy signal like the 32 inch Sony tube TV I had before it.The setup is pretty easy to use, and the TV is packed with features (impressive PIP in particular).  Menus are easy to navigate.  My only criticism is that if you have several devices plugged in, going from one input to another can take a good 10 seconds as the TV's \"reaction time\" is very slow when you want to go from TV to DVD to X-Box, etc...Overall, it's a good, not great, TV.  I'm happy I bought it - and if you can still find one (they're 3 generations old, having been replaced by the 5063 and now the 5085) at a clearance sale, it might be your best bet.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}

With the 10% off coupon plus $200 sale the price went down to about $3450 (no tax in Delaware). Not bad at all! With much lower price than most plasma TV with similar size I can still buy accessories like monster DVI cable, HD DVD player and voltage stabilizer. Also fits in my van!The TV is being hooked to Comcast HDTV and to Samsung HDTV DVD player. The picture is awesome and excellent. White color really looks 99.99% white, thing that I believe cannot be reproduced by regular projection TV. Besides, this TV is much lighter than even my 32\" Sony WEGA TV. So far so good. I don't have any complaint. I am even thinking to buy the larger one (61\") to put in my bedroom. Oh btw, don't buy those accessories like monster cables, etc, in Best Buy, Circuit City, etc., they are more expensive.

{"Title":"You may want to know more than what the manual tells you...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3TPKQXMF7TTCI","Overall":"good","Content":"I really like the TV.  I like the way the picture looks, considering that I spent $1500, and not $5000.  I've had my TV a few days, so I can't tell you how it holds up over time (I'll be back).  This review is a \"tell you what you may want to know from day one\" as much as it is a review.  I hope I can help prevent you from damaging your projection TV by telling things not mentioned in the manual.An earlier review (different website) gave the TV one star out of five because he said after eight months he had side bars permanently burned into his screen, and he felt the manual's \"don't use 4:3 mode more than 15% of the time\" wasn't enough information.  Keeping this in mind, I never use 4:3 with gray side bars (I can live with the \"Just\" stretch.)The manual says nothing about a break in period (it didn't say \"this TV has new technology and doesn't need a \"break-in\" either).  I've read several internet articles that recommend special treatment the first 100 hours--have the contrast turned down.  This TV doesn't list \"contrast\" but I'm assuming \"picture\" is the same thing.  One said 250 hours (most said one hundred).  Everyone said turn down the contrast (or in our case, I think `picture').  One said to turn down other things (well, you need some brightness, or else no light gets to the screen and that can't be a good break-in either J.  Several articles on projection TVs said \"Wow, after the breakin the picture became really great!\"  My second day I thought it was looking better than the first.  One site said \"don't just turn on your TV for 100 hours and say `I'm done!'\", that the turning the TV on and turning it off (so that the components warm up, then cool down, etc.) was a part of the conditioning.As delivered, the TV setting was on \"vivid\" which has the highest picture.  I turned that all the way down.  I hooked a computer LCD monitor up to my DVD player through an S-video, and ran component cables (red, green, blue) from the DVD player into the TV so I could compare the pictures.  The TV seemed to error on too much red (people skin color), so I changed color temperature to cool, and there was too much color, so I turned down the tint.  This gave people a more natural looking skin color.  This isn't a criticism of this particular model--one website named three TV brands and said they all give you a TV with the contrast (or picture) turned high and probably too much red.  For comic relief, one guy mentioned that the stores put the most expensive TV's in a category on \"vivid\" so they look better than the less expensive TVs.One site said that the large the projection TV, the more likelihood of problems like burn in .  I'm paranoid about the TV logos in the lower right corner if the logo is solid white (I sent ABC an email pleading with them to change to something half transparent so the colors underneath come through.)  News channels with a running ticker at the bottom of the screen-never!  Right now while I'm breaking the TV, I'm not playing any cartoons.  My understanding of the break in is to run the circuitry without a heavy load on the lamps (like driving your new car 50 miles an hour on the highway).  To me, the cartoons are very very colorful, equivalent to playing a normal movie on vivid.  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the break-in?  I hope to find something about this on the internet.Biggest complaint- I've already seen with two of my widescreen DVDs that they don't quite fill the screen from top to bottom (slight slivers of blackness at top and bottom) and none of the zoom modes will fix this.  Those DVD's are now banned from the TV(I'll play them on my computer).  One review site said the problem was that this TV only has four Zoom options, and other TVs have more.  Maybe later I'll get a new DVD player that can send out a signal with various zooms and then I would just put the TV on standard aspect (no zooming) to accept it.  Perhaps this is my biggest complaint against the TV, that the basic \"zoom\" can't make it zoom all the way in each direction.  From reading the manual, I would have thought it would zoom completely.TV gets 4 of 5 stars for excellent price to performance ratio.  I wanted to give 5, but if all this stuff I found on the internet is true, then when I bought the TV, I could have read the manual, turned it on, and misused/abused it during the first few weeks of use.  I don't know how much new lamps cost, or what I would pay for the labor.  The guy with the problem of the burned in side bars said that one would cost $500 total (parts and labor).","Date":"January 3, 2004"}
{"Title":"Gorgeous image","Author":"E. Cove \"arzec\"","ReviewID":"R1MHFF6GFSXN3M","Overall":"good","Content":"Since I just got this, I can't comment on its reliability, but mine looks and works great.  First off, the PT-53WX53 seems to be pretty lightweight - relatively speaking - compared to other 53\" HDTV's.  The image was pretty good right out of the box.  It has some brightness presets, and mine was set to \"Vivid\" which is probably too bright for most situations.  I changed that, and also brought down the color saturation.  Once I did all this, the image looked very good.  All I have right now is analog cable, which looks grainy on many channels.  But DVD's are crystal-clear: sharp, gorgeous color and contrast.  I did a little homework, and a couple of other RPTV brands (Hitachi and Mitsubishi) consistently came up as having superior images, but I think the differences are negligible - only hardcore videophiles could have a problem with the PT-53WX53's image.  I highly recommend this television.Added: I've since upgraded to digital cable with HD.  The regular digital cable images are fine.  But HD on this set is fantastic!

When he was done, I was left with a sparkling, amazingly clear picture.  The one drawback: once you've seen HD, you can't go back.This unit is an excellent value.

{"Title":"Panasonic PT53WX53 or PT47WX53. Why pay more, for less?","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3LMPT47C34NUT","Overall":"good","Content":"If you want a nice HDTV and have the room, I recommend the 53\" rear projection PANASONIC.Take a look at the Amazon reviews, Circuit City (or Best buy, can't remember which has reviews between BB and CC). The reviews were so stellar that I actually bought it sight unseen and shipped it from Amazon. And man!, were they right....the features and clarity is amazing (remember to lower brightness and no game systems for 1st 100 hours to avoid burn-in...also, avoid playing in 4x3 mode with vertical black bars for same reason).When you do all the math, it is cheapest to buy from Amazon (but only with an Amazon Credit Card) becuase it sells for $1499 at Amazon plus $119 for shipping... but then there is NO TAX (most states) and with the Amazon CC you get Triple point for Amazon purchases (and for every $2500 points you get a $25 Amazon Gift code in the mail), so that gets you *almost* enough points for $50 in Gift codes. Even with free shipping promo's or the $100 GC from BB, Amazon beats them becuase of the no sales tax.IMPORTANT: Everything I have read and heard from tech people in the industry (not you minimum wage CC or BB sales clerks) say that Plasma is too young of a technology, doesn't generally come with a tuner or speakers, costs a ton more and has a lifespan measured in hours (instead of years). My research suggests your plasma will last 5 years (and start to get fuzzy in about 2) and the rear-projection will last approx 20 years (but will of course need some maintenance over that time frame). Also, I have also heard that you should stay AWAY from LCD Projection TV (just get the standard 3 gun projector type) becuase the LCD type is driven by a bulb that costs $200-$300 and blows out every 5000 to 8000 hours (but indications are that your first one will happen in approx one year...which seems even faster than the the hourly guestimate). In fairness the bulb (on some models) is user replacable and the bulb may come down in price if the technolofgy catches on, but i wouldn't bet on it.The panasonic 53 inch has a native resolution of 1080 (and I believe you need a converter box to scalle the 720 broadcasts....it does regular old cable without a box , but becuase it is digital the picture ain't amazing with regular cable...but that doesn't matter to me...I wanted the HDTV for DVDs and when I eventually feel like shelling out more $$ for HDTV cable.).BTW, My last box was a rear-projection and died in about 6 years, so I was NOT ready to buy another rear-projection. But after research I found that my old box was notorious for a very high failure rate...there was even a class action lawsuit. I would mention the manufaturer, but it wouldn't matter becuase it was branded under multiple names and they don't make it anymore, so I don't want to prejudice people against a brand becuase of one particulr (defective) 6 year old model. However, I will say the manufacturer was NOT Panasonic. Suffice it to say, that I was all gung-ho for plasma and NOT looking for rear-projection, but after all the research and info I got, rear-projections in general, and the 53\" panasonice model specifically, won the contest hands down !If you have info that counters all this, please post for others to see...These are just my opinions based on my experiences/research and this is a big purchase...the more opinions the better.

{"Title":"Panasonic 53\" HD ready TV.  Best set for your $$ hands down.","Author":"Jeff Simon","ReviewID":"R3M7A9MSGDU21T","Overall":"good","Content":"I had a long time to research which TV I was going for and if you want a theater style experience with lots of great features, and fit it into a budget, get this set.  The biggest consideration in my opinion AFTER image quality (which is outstanding, but that's been dertermined in other reviews) is Aspect Ratio and how the TV deals with the two different formats.  (There are several aspect ratios, but I'm speaking on 16:9 \"theater\" & 4:3 \"television\")  This set does a good job of giving you several basic formats in which to choose from.  If you're looking for a TV that you can completely fine tune your picture with several zoom settings, this may dissapoint.  I found that they've included the perfect mix and I constantly find a perfect aspect ratio for me.  One setting titled \"JUST\" takes a 4:3 image and keeps the center 2/3's in original aspect and gradually stretchs the remaining 1/3 equally to the edges, this gives the most pleasing results for TV viewing.  On another note, Please read the manual for any TV you purchase.  The manual of this set says to not use the 4:3 drop down (which will make a television (4:3) signal display in the correct aspect, but will leave you with bars on the left and right of the screen) should be used LESS THAN 15% of the time.  If you don't you'll get image burn in.  And nobody wants that.  I would recommend Panasonic TV's to anyone, this is my second, and I will continue to purchase them in the distant future.","Date":"May 14, 2004"}

{"Title":"Wow","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1XR3DCDW1LMI","Overall":"good","Content":"Purchased this TV at Amazon.com after fiasco with an un-named online retialer. The TV is great. I spent about 3 months researching the field before I made my decision. I made at least 7 trips to Best Buy (not to confuse with bestbuyplasma.com grrrr...) looking at all the Sonys, Samsungs, Sharps, Hitachis, etc.  I have no clue how Best Buy can sell so many TVs these days. Prices are SO MUCH higher there than on Amazon. People either don't do research or too affraid of online purchases. I did pick up Samsung HD DVD player there though, only $20 more than online. I don't remember DVD model, the one that does 720p up-convert and has DVI out.This TV is cheapest you can find in 32\" 720p category that offers tremendous bang for the buck. Some reviews mentioned over-saturated red color, some mentioned flaws in picture quality. This is not true, plain and simple. This TV requires some tunning when unpacked from the box. Duhh... It took me about an hour to go through calibration and tuning. The results are amazing. Use DVI. Use DVI. Can I say it again? DVI is digital connection. Throw away all your fancy Monster Cables. It is unfortunate and makes me feel sad when people say how great DVI Monster cables are. I understand that analog Monster Cables are of high quality while perhaps being too pricey. With digital connection you either have a picture or you don't. There is no \"in-between\": no noise, no color change, no blurring is even possible. I am yet to see a DVI cable that would not transmit 0 and 1. $15 cable from Menards(!) worked just beautifully. Any and all DVI cables are equal.I went with gold plated S-video cable ($10 from Menards) for my older satellite dish that does not have DVI output (waiting for my HD pack now :) S-video is analog signal and requires some care, hence gold.Now bad things (not enough to reduce to 4 stars though): 1. Only one DVI input. I will have to buy DVI switch box.2. Setup: it takes some time to figure out correct set of modes(menus) for true digital (DVI) connection. The trick that helped me resolve the problem was connecting TV via old-fashioned composite cable along with DVI. This allowed for tracking menus even when no pitcure can be seen on DVI input.3. Speakers: I am not a great fan of elephant ears in TVs. TV looks much cleaner without them, fits very well in my not very large room. Combined with ($600) Infinity Total Solutions(TM) 6-Speaker System (TSS-750PLT) this TV is a peice of art in a frame. The downside was that I still had to pay for speakers that now sit in my garage.(...)","Date":"June 18, 2004"}
{"Title":"4 stars for movies, 5 for PC and video games.","Author":"SpaceMonkey","ReviewID":"R37L8J03A5U98G","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm no expert on Televisions, but I've read enough about them to write a useful review for you.  First off, as stated by another reviewer, the response time (16 milliseconds) is one of the fastest available and should be a big selling point for this screen.  Similar screens by other companies such as Dell for example have response times of 20 or 25 milliseconds.  The higher the number, the more \"lag\" or \"ghosts\" will be seen while watching movies.  Be sure to ask about response times of any LCD screens you look at.  I bought this TV over amazon.com and overall I'm very satisfied.  I mainly view DVD's, video games and surf the internet with mine.  I don't watch television much so I can't give you a review of that.  From what I've read, LCD screens are not the greatest for regular television viewing; however, HDTV will look awesome as soon as it becomes the standard.  Here is the equipment I'm using:  I have a samsung HDTV dvd upconverter player.  It's a newer dvd player that enhances standard dvd's up to minimum HDTV standards (720p or 1080i).  I used the DVI connection via a $100 monster cable which can be found on amazon.  It doesn't pay to own this TV if you plan on viewing anything with composite (S-video) connections.  The component video is extremely better especially hooked up to a progressive scan dvd player (480p).  When viewing DVD's through my player, there wasn't much difference between picture quality using the DVI input (720p or 1080i) or the progressive scan component connection (480p).  This is only true because of the DVD player I'm using; DVI is still the best connection you can get for any TV.  The DVI input for this TV should be a major selling point because it will be used for any HDTV signal.I rate movie viewing 4 stars because of a few flaws.  The flaws can be seen while watching older dvds.  Most movies looked great from start to finish except during certain scenes:  I watched \"Good morning vietnam\" in (480p) and the picture experienced some lag.  The actors lips were not moving along to the audio; the picture was trying to catch up to the dialogue - very annoying.  The same thing was experience while watching a newer dvd entitled \"Cabin fever\" in (720p).  Whenever a movie had fog or rain or mist in the foreground around the actors like in \"Master and Commander\", the image would get somewhat grainy in (720p); however, the rest of the movie looked great.  Aside from that, other movies seemed to look great from begining to end.  All three Lord of the Rings movies looked stunning in (720p) - hardly any flaws; the same was true with all three matrix movies.  Overall, it is a good set to watch movies on, but it depends upon the quality of your player, the connections and the quality of the DVD.  Older dvd's experienced alot of lag along with a few newer ones.  But, a majority of newer dvd's (from the last 5-7 years) looked great.  They looked better than a CRT model - using my set up.I feel that the real great thing about this TV is the ability to hook it up your computer.  You no longer have to sit in front of a little 15, 17 or whatever sized screen.  You can sit on your couch, put the keyboard in your lap, and surf the net on a 32\" just like you were watching TV.  If you use a computer often for the net or typing or even PC gaming, this is definatly the TV to buy.  The computer image was flawless.  I play simcity4 and it looks amazing.  Again, the equipment you hook up can play a big difference in the results you get.  I have a 2.4ghz Dell 4600 with a DVI output.  I haven't hooked up the PC via component connection yet and I don't know if you can. This is more than just a TV, it's a huge computer monitor and this was the main selling point for me.  Highly recommended for PC use.Lastly, video games look amazing as well.  I have my Xbox hooked up through a high definition pack via a component connection.  Games such as Halo, Tigerwoods 2004, Unreal Championship, Splinter cell etc. look crisper and cleaner than on any CRT that I've seen.  I've played xbox on a samsung 30\" HDTV CRT with the high definition pack and this LCD screen still looks better.  Overall, This is a good buy.  I have a few complaints about some movies, but most have no problem with lag.  This could have something to do with the player I'm using so don't let that discourage you from buying this.  One thing to keep in mind is that as time goes on, dvds will increase in picture quality up until high definition dvds comes out.  As soon as that happens, this TV shouldn't experience any lag at all - hopefully.","Date":"June 8, 2004"}
{"Title":"Handsome quality, still takes getting used to","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1P4SYEQTZQ0QQ","Overall":"good","Content":"This screen is a total indulgence for me. I waded through a lot of the jargon to familiarize myself with the technology, but in the end, it was still a sort of irrational decision. The box is huge, but the set is optimally sized, with the case not much larger than the screen. The detachable speakers have stayed in the box, which was a selling point for me. Wish I could have bought the screen more cheaply without the speakers at all. The connections are pretty robust, yet it took me several attempts to bring up an image. I'm neither the biggest geek nor the biggest technophobe, so getting the devices to communicate was less obvious than I may have preferred but ultimately do-able. So many options can turn into a tragedy of riches.Picture quality is quite good but quite different from the blur of a CRT. It's very bright, which works well for dark images, and it gets over ambient light very well. The composite connection yields really poor results, but who really expects to use that? The component connection is far, far better, but even that reveals screen artifacts unknown in a CRT, such as the distortion of lines moving across the screen. Progressive scan DVD players are reported to improve this (I don't yet own one).Without a lot of video sources or comparisons to other LCD or plasma, I can't reliably steer a potential buyer toward or away from this product, but aside from a few minor quibbles, I'm quite happy thus far with mine.","Date":"March 5, 2004"}

{"Title":"Super beautiful HDTV if you have the room for it !","Author":"gtippitt","ReviewID":"R2VAGXLPC179IF","Overall":"good","Content":"UPDATE after 18 months -I've been using this TV with a home theater PC running MythTV software for the past 18 months.  It really is a wonderful TV.  I can surf the web and email from across the room in a recliner or watch TV with really great video quality.  Adding an inexpensive used PC with a usb TV tuner lets this display really show off what it can do!..........I recently bought a SONY KP-57WS510 TV and love it.  It is a 57 inch HDTV.  It only has two major drawbacks.  The first is that it only has an analog NTSC tuner and will not tune in ATSC digital broadcast channels or cable clear QAM channels.  You must use a cable or satelite box or a digital tuner for OTA digital.  The TV is HDTV ready in that it can display 1080i or DVD 480P.  The TV's 2nd drawback is that you cannot hang it on the wall like a picture frame, because it is lots bigger than a flatpanel and weighs about 150 pounds.With a 16:9 HDTV display that is 57 inches diagonally. This is a really BIG DISPLAY.  It is 50 inches wide and 30 inches high.  For a non-flatpanel, it does not take nearly as much space in the room as I was afraid it might.  I was replacing an old 32 inch TV with picture tube.  The display of this rear projection TV is twice as wide as my old TV, but the cabinet does not stick out into the room as far as the old TV did.  The cabinet of the Sony KP-57WS510 is only 27 inches deep from wall to front of display.Before looking at this TV, I had always hated rear projection TVs, because they were fuzzy looking if you were standing less than 20 feet away.  The picture on this TV is not only huge, but sharp and crisp from only 5 to 10 feet away.  If you try to watch it from less than 7 feet away, it is somewhat tiring on your neck, because you must turn your head from left to right to see the entire picture because it is so wide.  When my old 32 inch TV died, I could not afford a new flatpanel that was as tall as my old display.  I started looking at large-used TVs that had been replaced with flatpanels (by people with more money to waste than I have).This TV rolls easily on its own wheels.  The seller and I were able to lift it onto the bed of a pickup truck.  I was able to unload the TV easily by myself at home by using some boards for a ramp to roll the TV from the back of the pickup onto my front porch and into my living room.  In less than 15 minutes after getting home with the TV in the back of a pickup truck, I was watching a DVD on the TV and in awe of its beauty.  It cost me less than the sales tax would have been when the TV was new.","Date":"March 27, 2012"}

{"Title":"6 1/2 years, a few repairs!!!","Author":"Kawa Jaan \"THE GAMER\"","ReviewID":"R2H5XYZEUBCEQY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this TV for about 6 1/2 years. About 3 years ago, one of the convergence chips broke and had to be replaced. Then, 2 years ago, the other one went bust. The total repair cost for both was about $250.When new, we paid about $2700 for this TV. Back then, I wasn't a huge online shopper and I didn't do any comparison to see if I was getting the best TV or the best deal. Anyway, the picture quality of the TV is still pretty good. DVD Movies look sharp and clear, especially in a dark room, and the speakers produce good sound quality. My only other complaint -other than the fact that it broke twice and had to be repaired- is of the TV's remote control. It has not been easy to program the remote with various media devices; even my DVD player, which is also a Sony, cannot be controlled by this remote! Other than that, the lack of an HDMI input is also a negative. But I guess back then when this TV was made (2004), TVs didn't come with HDMI connections. However, the TV does have connections for all the Component Video and DVI devices that you can possibly have, (I have had up to 4 devices connected to it, with the S-Video, Component, DVI, etc). So, overall, this is a good, big-screen TV that produces good sound and picture and, if bought today, is very inexpensive for a 57\" TV.","Date":"December 2, 2011"}

{"Title":"Sony Rear Projection TV Model KP-57WS510","Author":"tg","ReviewID":"R33UTG5EAZJI0L","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this model Sony rear projection HDTV in 2004. It is used daily and often on for several hours. It's 2012 now and I still watch it. But I must advise anyone who has a rear projection tv to keep the rear vents vacuumed and dust free. Dust will accumulate inside the tv and should be cleaned every few years. This also applies to all electrical devices (pc's, vcr's, dvd players) because electrical components attract dust by laws of physics. I'm very ashamed to admit this but I did not clean inside this tv for seven years. It's amazing it did not overheat something or quit altogether. Goes to show how durable Sony made this tv. But I know better now after seeing the inside of the tv. I never imagined how dusty it could be until I removed the rear vent panel. If you have pets as I do there'll be more accumulation than normal. NOTE: if you are not comfortable doing this yourself, hire a service tech if you can. There's always risk of damaging parts or electrical shock from a capacitor or something. But I promise the cleaning will be well worth it and lengthen the tv's life.  I used a soft brush attachment on a vacuum cleaner, gently brushing and lighty touching the dust to stir it loose and into the vacuum. Spray camera lens or eyeglass lens cleaner onto a soft cloth and gently clean the three lamps. DO NOT TOUCH the large projection mirror above because it will scratch just from fingers touching it.Anyway, after assembling the panel and turning on the tv, I was absolutely amazed at the picture quality. 100% better. It was like getting a new tv. The dust had accumulated so slowly I didn't realize the picture had become that bad. As with all Sony equipment, this tv model will provide years of great service if treated carefully and kept clean. Do as the owners manual advises, ALWAYS HANDLE WITH CARE!Enjoy!","Date":"March 23, 2012"}

I love how lightweight it is, and it's perfect for a tight space. The base allows you to adjust the vertical and horizontal angle, so you can angle the TV up & down depending on where you've got it in the room.  My biggest complaint is the noisy power supply unit.  It makes a consistent high-pitched ring tone when the TV is off.  Sharp says this is common with all electronics, but I've never heard it this loud on any of my other equipment. Because the TV is in the bedroom, the ringing keeps me up at night. We've even had it replaced with no improvement, so now I have to unplug the TV every night. If you have sensitive ears, this TV may not be good for your bedroom.  I've got a Sony 42\" flatscreen downstairs that doesn't make this annoying noise at all.","Date":"February 5, 2004"}

It's just too small for today's modern human eyes.  For a typical living room, the minimum TV should be a 37\" Panasonic plasma set.  42\" is another good choice, although for most people 50\" would be an overkill.This Sharp 20\" NTSC TV is perfect for the bedroom.  It takes up very little space on the nightstand, and it sports sharp and high-contrast image quality, making watching TV pleasant rather than eye-straining.  This model is not widescreen, but that's ok for me because at 20\", widescreen would have made images too small for me.  This model is also not HDTV, but rather EDTV (extended definition), which it means it fully supports progressive-scan DVD playback.  Hook this up to a progressive scan DVD player -- I have the super-compact CyberHome model I got at Radio Shack for $45 -- and you'll get some great-looking DVD movies in your bedroom.As a secondary TV for your bedroom or kitchen or study, this Sharp delivers great quality and great value.","Date":"September 27, 2004"}

{"Title":"Vivid colors, crystal clear DVD picture and great value","Author":"karnog \"Paul\"","ReviewID":"R253SDYAGDO0O2","Overall":"good","Content":"When I first laid my eyes on this set in the showroom, I couldn't believe it. I had just been ogling over a $10k plasma set an aisle away, thinking I would never be able to get a set with such crystal clear clarity and vivid colors. Then, I saw the 42WE610. Sony truly came through with an affordable combination of existing technologies (LCD and rear projection) to produce a value-conscious high-end set.Now that I am through gushing, I have had this set for about 3 months and will attempt a more objective review. I have watched many hours of DVD movies as well as analog, digital and high-definition cable. The only video type I haven't watched is VHS. The Con section below may seem bigger but it is only because I am trying to be more descriptive. Pros: Bright, vivid colors. Incredible clarity (over 3 million dots of resolution.) DVI input. Slim, sleek design. Light-weight, proportionate to its size (approximately 45lbs.)Cons: Reasonable angled viewing but still has some problems when being viewed from wide, side angles or from above horizontal (i.e. 90 degrees, or above the set, such as when standing or if seated from a perched position.) Speakers are mediocre but I would think almost anyone buying a set like this has at least some sort of home theater system through which they will power it. Analog cable is a disappointment, not because the set is directly to fault but the resolution of analog cable is so low. The picture looks grainy and just plain unremarkable. If you plan to watch a lot of regular (analog) TV then you may want to reconsider. Digital TV is noticably better and HD TV is great. One last con is that I still struggle with 16:9 aspect ratio sets. It's in between true wide screen and a regular TV so either the scene is stretched and cutoff in places or there is that annoying strip missing across the top and the bottom. That is really a personal quibble though and any set with this ratio is like that.Summary: Without being too repetitive, this is a great set at a great price, given the quality. Hook it up to a decent sound system and enjoy great digital broadcasting and DVD movies. I suggest getting at least a 2-3 year extended warranty since this is still new technology and its lifetime is unknown ...better safe than sorry. Watching traditional CRT TV's will never be the same after you watch this for a while. It is life-like and mesmerizing when displaying high quality DVD movies. It actually puts the theaters to shame since the colors and clarity are far superior to anything they can put on a big screen. I hope to see more technology and prices like this coming out over the next couple years.","Date":"November 3, 2003"}
{"Title":"Worth Every Penny","Author":"Henry H. Pan \"figmund\"","ReviewID":"R1Z0G2ALX9MCEW","Overall":"good","Content":"After spending months looking at traditional big screens, plasmas and the Samsung DLP, we decided on this technology.  I just wasn't impressed with what I saw from the DLP televisions. Few plasmas are true HD, and the DLP image seemed soft to me. The picture on the Sony Grand Wegas is crisp and clean, never soft (unless you want it that way - Sony provides several settings).  One of the greatest things about this type of TV is that there's no burn-in issues, so I don't have to \"zoom\" all the traditional NTSC. I much prefer to have black bars on the left and right than have, everyone look fat. The 480p off a DVD is stunning - and I can't wait to get an HDTV tuner hooked up. The black levels are quite good, it works well in our sun-lit living room, and the viewing angle is very wide. Strangely, the viewing angle gets better after the TV has warmed up a bit.  We happen to have a Sony digital camera, and with the memory stick feature, my wife can watch photo slideshows on the big screen - a bonus feature she really likes.","Date":"November 21, 2003"}
{"Title":"Plasma with Reliability","Author":"David A. Riley","ReviewID":"R1RNR2XN94NZ60","Overall":"good","Content":"If you want to hang your TV on the wall I understand the attraction of Plasma.  If not (I believe the majority of people out there do not hang their TV on the wall yet)this is a real alternative with significant advantages.  If it breaks buy a bulb, not a whole TV as you would with Plasma.  Burn in is very unlikely with this technology, whereas Plasma is very prone to it.  Picture quality is better in my opinion in normal conditions, additionally you do not have to suffer the irritation of pixel distortion that currently is a fact of life with Plasma.There is no comparison with CRT, just the 60lbs of weight and the fact it measures around 14\" in depth make it worth the change for me.  The picture is truly excellent and unlike non LCD projection TV's the light conditions in the room have a minimal effect.  The viewing mode can be adjusted (vivid, standard etc)to taste and used to enhance the mood of a movie or offset light conditions.Freeze frame and PIP are cool allthough I don't see me using them very much, my brain can only watch one thing at a time unlike other people.  One bonus I did not know about when I bought it but love, is that I can insert the memory sticks from my digital camera and watch a slide show of my pictures in seconds after getting back from a trip.If you are a non geek you will love how easy and quick it was to set up, with no knowledge I hooked it up in minutes.If you want to move it any time you do not need to hire a fork lift and three big guys to help you, at a push I can carry it myself limited by size more than weight.At the end of the day it's just a TV and compared to CRT a very expensive TV at that.  But if you want Flat Screen, HDTV, that is big but light and has outstanding picture quality but you don't want to take on the Plasma risk this is one great package.","Date":"May 11, 2004"}

I was thinking of a Plasma screen but found too many negatives about those. I really hesitated to buy this TV at first. I heard that the bulbs go bad within a month of purchase. Luckily mine has been running for 4 months without a problem.With low quality TV broadcasts you do have a little bit of the screen door effect. It's not that bad at all and you can barely notice it. I just probably sit too close to the television. It's magically disappears when you watch movies, or least I myself just can't see it.The picture quality is amazing with DVDs, especially Pixar films. I don't use the built in speakers much but they sound just fine. I suggest getting a good calibration DVD for this unit, such as AVIA or Video Essentials. It's a pretty good investment.I have a Playstation 2 connected to the TV with component inputs and widescreen mode in games make everything look so much better. I was worried about ghosting, but I have no noticed any of that and I do play fast paced games such as Gran Turismo 3 etc.I'm trying hard to come up with some negatives about this TV. There isn't many at all. When turning on the TV it takes 30 seconds to get a good image, but that's normal. If you accidently turn off the power and turn it back on it takes even longer. Not more than a few more seconds.The remote is well made. The TV has 6 input channels and I wish there was a way to instantly switch to the one you want instead of having to press 'input' up to 5 or so times.I also should note that at first I was worried that DVD players with upconversion and DVI connectors wouldn't work on this unit. They do work just fine, but stayed with my old DVD player when I realized it wasn't worth the $199 upgrade.UPDATE: June 10th 2006Had my first EVER problem with this television. The picture would come up and then disappear after 5 seconds. When I turned off the TV the red light would flash 5 times. All I did was a little research and I found out I needed to replace the \"Lamp Driver\". It cost me a couple hundred and I did it myself. Problem fixed!

Well, compared to comparably sized plasma and DLP sets, the 42WE610 is inexpensive.Cutting to the chase - This set will appeal to you if:-You desire a very bright screen (this set is BRIGHT!) which can perform even in daylight-You would like a slim TV (much smaller than CRT, about a foot deep)-You see rainbows on DLP sets-You don't have $4000 or more for an HDTV plasma (not EDTV panels which are cheaper)This set's cons are:- a somewhat lackluster black level (which can be tweaked very effectively by either professional calibration or online research)- sporadic reports of problems, which all seem to be resolved as of mid-2004.Subjectively, I feel this set outperforms plasma screens, as the pixel structure is not as easy to see, and for the brightness levels achievable (wouldn't want to burn in that plasma!).I also feel it outperforms DLP, because the picture is less noisy  and there are no rainbow effects (trails of color on high contrast images caused by the viewer's perception of the color wheel which separates 1-chip DLP white light into colors). DLP has slightly better blacks, but they're very close. In my opinion, the Grand Wega generally produces a picture which is less noisy and more \"film-like.\"In summary, anyone would be pleased with this set's overall performance.

One thing I also liked about the lamp is that it never caused the picture to go dim or gradually distore the picture quality. That may be inconvenient for some people but I always plan ahead and I had bought a replacement lamp after the 3rd year so I was able to quickly replace it. When the lamp goes out it also has a small red light indicator on the front panel of the TV which tells you that so thats a big plus!Now to the technical aspects of it, the picture and sound quality is vivid, clear and amazing, it doesnt matter if you have a well lit room or a darker living room, One thing I didnt like too much are the 3 different picture adjustments options it gives you, when you try to adjust it from the remote control its hard to really get it just right, but once you get it just right it gives you a beatiful picture. I only tried the HD for one NFL season since it was a lot more back then to get HD then it is now but during that time I experienced amazing HD quality which almost puts you right in there.Sonys are a bit pricier than some phillips, LGs, Mitsubishis and other brands ive seen out there but its worth every dollar. Everytime I walk by the open items section at best buy or see returned items at other stores or online you always see all those other brands expect for Sony. If you are going to spend alot of money on a Big screen TV you want it to be not just good as far as quality but also durable and that is what you will get with sony. Ive always heard many good things about Samsung which is probably the next thing I will try since they are much more affordable now but in my main livingroom I will continue to enjoy my grand wega TV. One other convenient thing about this TV unit is that its very light, you can move it around easily to connect extra devices or simply to move around. The screen doesnt connect much dust and doesnt get affected by it, a small dry towel is all you need to get the dust off and keep it clear.Hope this is helpful to anyone looking to get this particular model. You wont be dissapointed.","Date":"December 25, 2009"}

(I was not aware there was a problem with the current TV)  After an hour of drooling in the plasma section we rounded the corner & both of us said, LOVE IT!! It had the best picture there.  Now, a year and a half later, I am still amazed at the picture quality. It seems like you right there with the photographer!  Occasionally it powers on with a crazy screen but turn it off & wait 10 minutes or so & it is fine.  (Service stated it is like your computer-sometimes it mis-loads upon powering up) We would certainly buy it again! We have been happy with Sony products in the past but they out did themselves this time.December 2009 - it has been 5-plus yrs & one bulb replacement later, the screen is just now showing discoloration in the background.  If you look hard at the background behind the picture, you can see color spots starting to appear, especially evident on a white background.  However, considering this is the primary TV and watched every day for the last 5-plus years, I think we have more than received our money's worth.Now on to researching a 60-plus inch to \"fill the gap in our entertainment center\".

However I took a leap of faith and purchased one anyway. It took me 2 weeks to finally find one as every store in my area was completely sold out of them (from 42\"-60\") & some store are still sold out to this date. That excited me more as I was not the only person who liked this tv. You can make the pictures the same size in PIP mode which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience as I play my xbox and watch my favorite shows. I have do not have HDTV in my area yet but I did hear it's night and day difference. However most cable company's do not offer a lot of HDTV channels, thus the low cost. But I do watch the discovery channel a lot so I will benefit from it. This tv is HD-ready: Fully capable of high-definition display when connected to an optional HDTV source. Conventional analog TV reception is provided via a built-in NTSC tuner. Equipment:TV: Sony Grand WEGA 42\" KF42WE610Video Monster 3: Coax Cable & Component Cable WARNING, WARNING, WARNING!Component/Coax wires do affect the quality of your home video experience. The best DVD player connected to the best Plasma/LCD/DLP/LCOS TV will have negative effects on picture quality if you are not using the best grade of Component/DVI/Coax cable. Yes, you will have to shell out more money for theses accessories (in my opinion Monster Cable has proven itself in my house). However, this is the only way to achieve your large screen TV's maximum video performance. It appears that it's not only necessary but simply required! I get mad every time I read negative reviews on this DVD player or my TV when they never invested in high-grade video cables or, their TV is only 480i compatible & not 480p compatible (they can't properly use the DVD player's progressive scan feature). Please check your manual to verify 480p compatibility for your TV, as some are only 480i compatible while others are only 780p to 1080i compatible!!! Here is a tip to improve picture quality for analog cable/antenna viewers:Use a A/C powered, 2 port, coaxial, Electroline Drop Amp to improve analog cablereception. The 18 gauged Satellite coax cable runs from the cable co. to the Electroline Drop Amp in my house. The 1 Meter Monster Video 3 coax cable (gray colored wire) will run from the Electroline Drop Amp to the TV thus improving picture quality.

{"Title":"Broken after ONE WEEK","Author":"Jason","ReviewID":"R822SOPDLH5AB","Overall":"bad","Content":"WARNING!!  My 42\" SONY KF42WE610 worked well for one week and then we lost all of the red color in it.  It took hours just trying to reach someone at SONY--they have over 1 hour wait times when you call for technical assitance.  Usually they will not even accept your call if the wait is over one hour long, so it may be days before you get to talk to a tech at SONY just to troubleshoot the problem.  Unfortunately we could not return it to the online store like we could if we bought it locally.  So, we had to use a Sony Preferred TV Repair store, of which they had only 1 store in a city of 120,000 people.  And unfortuntately it has turned out to be not the most efficient store, for it has taken almost 3 weeks just to order the part we need now.  So, please heed this warning, I would not go with a SONY product anymore; not only over 1 hour waits just to speak to someone, but also for the lousy back up service as well. We even bought the extended warranty and this what we get!  This is not anti-SONY propaganda, this is a true story.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}
{"Title":"Just bought.","Author":"Altruism Is Dead \"Random reviewer\"","ReviewID":"R2PVVBZV2M32DM","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought this tv acouple days ago. I had been wanting a plasma screen television for quite some time, and when I seen the price of this for alittle bit under $2,000 in a local advertisement I had to take a look at it.When I went there I was quite impressed with it, visually it looked great, the design of the case and the picture quality itself. I asked the sales person alot of question but he didn't really know too much about it so it made me question the integrity of SVA, a brand which I had never heard of at the time.I went online to try and find some reviews and information about it, but could only find these same reviews below on abunch of other websites, which didn't really help at all since you have 2 people saying they like it, and 1 person that posted twice about how it sucks and not explaining a reason why. After abit more research I read that the picture tube is made from a Samsung picture tube. I heard of this before where other companies like Dell import pieces of plasma screen tvs and construct them in one of their factories to keep the price down.After visiting the store again, this time with my brother to decide on final purchase, me and him went over all of their plasma tvs and gave them our own bare eye inspection. Both of us thought that the SVA had a great picture quality compared to all of the other plasma screen tvs they had on display, and in alot of cases it looked even better than alot of the tvs on display.When I bought it, the only thing that was bad was the stand was broken on it (which we recieved another stand) and for being a plasma screen tv and how thin it is, it is very heavy. The other thing is that it has no controls on the tv itself, there is no volume, channel, video select or even a television power on! (Although there is a main power turn on/off) So if your remote control breaks (and you don't have a universal remote programmed for it) it sounds like you'll have to order a new remote.I read from a different review that someone was having problems with the remote control and that it had a \"mind of its own\". I haven't came across this problem at all, either that person had a faulty remote control, or was talking nonsense.But still, like I mentioned before, I have recently bought this plasma tv, I haven't had any problems with it yet, and I had been looking up information about preventing burn-ins since I hear it plagues plasma tv's and I play alot of video games and intend to use it as a pc monitor as well.Also another nice addition was that included ALL the hook ups you need. I am not sure about the exact amount of cords, but it include acouple of the same ones like 2 a/v cords, 2 normal left/right audio cords, 1 component, 1 s-video, 1 pc cord, 1 pc to component (which is really cool), 1 analog(?) cable, and 1 audio (you know like a head phone jack) to left/right audio cord.  I thought that this was very cool since alot of tvs I had bought and other people bought didn't include, or only included maybe 1 or 2 cords.I gave this a rating of 4 because like I said, I had just recently purchased this tv and still am testing it out. I wrote this review to help people get alittle bit more knowledge about this tv since I couldn't find much help about it online either. My biggest suggestion for anyone interested in this tv is to go to a store and take a look at it and compare it to other plasma tv's, make sure to check for burn ins and everything. When I was checking it out at the store they did not have the audio set up, only the picture cables were hooked up, when I got it home and tested out the audio, I was quite surprised at the quality of it since I heard alot of plasma screens with speakers didn't give good quality. But still I run all my audio through my reciever for surround sound, which the majority of people that purchase plasma tv's do as well, so you wont be worrying much about the audio on this... which I believe by looking at it, it has 4 sets of speakers, I could be wrong... but it did give off some nice sound for when I was testing it out.","Date":"July 4, 2004"}
{"Title":"Best priced EDTV plasma with everything you need.","Author":"Linda Kirk","ReviewID":"R1XVJAN6GAXNP3","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, I'm not new to plasma's. I bought my first HDTV plasma more than a year ago! It is the Pioneer 433cmx with approx 1072x760 pixels. This is true HD, but although the Pioneer works great, it cost me $4,200 total. So now I've learned that the difference between the EDTV units and the HDTV units is the pixels. When you watch a DVD on a EDTV plasma like the SVA unit, it will look slightly better than a HDTV plasma because the pixels on the EDTV unit closely match the DVD and when you play HDTV signals on a HDTV plasma, the HDTV will show a slightly better picture than the EDTV. So is the HDTV worth $2000 more??  I used my eyeball test and compared the SVA Plasma to the other EDTV plasmas in a local store and decided on the SVA. Amazon has a great price and the unit comes with everything, cast iron desk stand, great speakers with base and treble controls, a tuner for cable or RF signals, 2 composite video inputs, 1 component and 1 15pin computer monitor input. I don't use the PIP feature but its there. I use this in the bedroom and its great! comes with a 1 year warranty. Thanks Amazon! I gave this a 4 only because of its weight. With the stand it weighs 135lbs and I needed help lifting it on to its viewing table.","Date":"May 2, 2004"}

It is on for at least 8 to 12 hours a day. We have not had a single issue at all so far. I run a replay dvr unit into this plasma and it looks great. DVD's look great at 720. I have friends who have much more expensive units that they bought last year, including Sony and Dell. They are all very impressed with the picture quality. The replay has a slide show on 'pause' and it looks great on the screen. The static picture (10 second slideshow) gets excellent reviews with no flicker or dead pixels. It really looks great. Even in fast action scenes in adventure movies do not cause image issues on the screen. I almost bought a Sony or a Fujitsu since I didn't really want to think or do research about the quality of the unit. One of the costco home workers said that over a 100 had left the warehouse and only one was returned (and it was not returned for a failure). I cannot speak to other issues about customer service since I have not had to deal with them. I have been saving a lot of money by buying dvd's and watching movies at home with this plasma and the surround sound. It is really awesome and I wish I had bought this thing last year when I first saw it. The only issue I have is the component video input via the 15 pin dsub. One of the two silver retaining screws (just like any pc card has) fell out. Therefore the vga connection is not super tight but it still works. As another reviewer mentioned, this unit is heavy and I have it about 5 feet in the air on a hearth. So, only when I have someone help me lift it down will I replace it. Other than that, it is pretty cool. Buy this unit and save the money you would spend for a name brand!UPDATEOver one year later and still going strong.  I don't detect any burn in or any dead pixels either.","Date":"August 10, 2004"}

I own this Plasma as well and find it's performance is unmatched by any other product at this price point or more and Yes it does use a Samsung plasma screen. The unit is well built. Picture quality is fantastic with DvD and Tv is actually good for cable signals better then CRT DLP or LCOS. Unlike other projection units DLP LCOS and so on this unit has even brightness and colour not seen in rear projectors as well as it doesnt have a beamy picture like dlp and LCOSAs for the other reviewer saying he cant turn it on after shutting it off . It says in the manual DO NOT TURN ON WITHIN 2 MINUTES AFTER SHUTTING IT OF! Might be why u have a issue U need to read the manual This is why they have it. Sure the manual isnt the best but it covers the most important features. Anyway I think u all should give this unit some consideration. In a few years this comapny SVA will be just like Samsung.

{"Title":"Only EDTV, poor contrast, questionable reliability","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"RHEUJB60UIL9V","Overall":"bad","Content":"SVA is a large TV manufacturer based in China, while the \"heart\" of this plasma screen, the plasma panel itself, is made by Samsung of South Korea.  This means two things: 1) questionable build quality and durability, and 2) subpar image quality.You may be attracted by the attractive price on this set, but believe me, there's a reason why it's so cheap.  Unlike state-of-the-art plasma planels from Pinoneer and Panasonic, the SVA exhibits poor contrast, no matter how you try to adjust the settings.  There's also significant pixelation when viewing fast-action scenes, such as sports.  The exterior also feels rather flimsy, which is not surprising given the low-cost market the company builds its \"reputation\" in.For two grand, you only get EDTV meaning the resolution tops out at 480.  A little more money will get you HDTV entries from Gateway.  Given 720p is pretty much a must given how fast the HDTV industry is evolving, I recommend against an EDTV no matter what.  So what if you have a 42\" screen?  Remember the concept of \"dot pitch\" from the computer monitor world?  A low resolution looks especially bad on a large screen.  An older-technology-based screen like this SVA-Samsung is really not worth the savings, because in the long run you suffer, as you find yourself having to upgrade to true HDTV, not the least because all your friends have HDTV!Recommendation:  stay away from this cheap set with poor screen quality and unknown reliability.  I always think that if you are going to spend a lot of money on a TV, you might as well go with a good one.  Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips, Gateway, ... you have many choices that are much better and give you more bang for the buck.","Date":"October 20, 2004"}

I had found a deal on a satellite receiver that could tune the local channels in HD and connect to the bigscreen with S-Video.  I had decided that I would not upgrade until I found a 60 inch or larger with a better picture.  I saw this Sony on display showing Discovery HD, and had to have it.  Since I got it home, I have been glued to it watching anything available in HD.The Set:  It is an LCD-projection system using a very bright lamp to project thru the LCD and onto the screen. It never needs converging. It is not affected by speakers or magnets.  It has seven inputs for sources such as a DVD player, satellite receiver, etc.. Four inputs (one on the front) accept S-Video or composit video plus two channels of encoded audio. There are two inputs for RGB component sources, and one DVI input for the highest grade connection.  The internal tuner will tune any broadcast tv channel, analog or digital, and offers picture with picture(side-by-side) and can adjust the size of the two pictures to maximize one and minimize the other.The picture: It's like standing at a window and looking at the world.  Simply breathtaking. There are several modes to take less-than-HD sources and fill the screen. With movies on DVD, it's better than the picture in a movie theater. and DVD players are only 480I/P sources.  A 1080I source provides the best picture.The Sound:  The internal sound system provides excellent sound with several modes.  The Trusurround(tm) mode will provide a very good impersonation of Dolby 5.1 surround, minus the sub-woofer. I frequently hear sounds behind me and turn to realize the home theater system is OFF, and I am listening to the TV's sound.  For most people, the onboard sound will be enough.  For those that want all of the theater experience, you will probably want a home theater system. I have a Sony DAV-FC9 home theater system for full enjoyment of movies.Other:  This set weighs 225lbs in it's carton.  Sony recommends no less than 4 people to move it and has provided some hand-holds for that purpose.  It needs a sturdy base to sit on.  Sony's base is overpriced, in my opinion.  I found a nice base from a home theater collection at a furniture store.  It has room for DVD recorders, satellite receivers, or the home theater receiver.  The screen protector is a solid sheet of tempered glass about 3 inches larger than the screen. It makes the set a bit front heavy. Read the manual for more info ([...]  The glass has a front-surface anti-glare coating to cut down on reflections.  It should not be touched, except for gentle cleaning.  If you are watching a dark program(outside scene at night) you may still get some reflections from light room objects, but not overwhelming.To Sum it Up:  I am very happy with this HDTV receiver.  I still have not found a better picture on anything bigger than 60 inches. I apparently am not the only fan.  I had to order it from a local store by placing a 20% deposit and wait for the next shipment. My one complaint, if that, is that with this sharp of a picture, you can see the flaws in lesser programming.","Date":"March 11, 2004"}

I had a repair tech come out and he told it had a bad optical assy and that I should contact Sony as there was a known issue with this part. I contacted Sony and they claim that while there is a known issue that \"my particular issue\" wasn't the specific issue covered by the extended warranty. Bottom line is they want $1,400 to repair it. So I am stuck with a peice of junk KDF70XBR950 that I paid more for then my car and Sony refuese to stand behind it. Buyers beware - Sony does not stand behind their products. I can buy a new 73 inch Mitsubschi for $3500 so why pay for the $1400 repair for a product that will just fail again....There will never be another Sony product in my household!","Date":"August 14, 2007"}

No buyer's remorse what-so-ever.  I still have not seen a better TV at this size, and I have looked at DLP, LCD-RP, LCD-directview, plasma, CRT, and also front projection.  Five of my friends have gone out and bought this TV (or the 60-inch version) after seeing it in action at my house.  I cannot say enough about how stunning the picture quality is.The 60-inch version of this TV now uses LCoS instead of LCD, and I think it has higher resolution, so I may wish to upgrade if they ever come out with the 70-incher in LCoS.I have heard two complaints about this TV in the HD forums.  One of which is completely bogus.  The other may be a concern.1)  The big sheet of plexiglass in front of the screen causes too much glare.  This is the bogus complaint.  If they had put a lenticular screen in front to cut down on glare, you would lose both brightness and viewing angle.  Give me the ultra-bright, super-sharp, wide-angle-viewable screen any day and I'll do whatever else can be done to cut down on the glare.2)  The contrast drops off sharply at dark grey.  Yes, LCDs have contrast problems below a certain brightness level.  You will definitely see a sharp drop off in detail in darker areas of the screen when watching this TV.  It is inherent to LCD.  No way around it.  In my opinion, there are at least as many drawbacks to the other technologies (DLP, Plasma, CRT).Go get one of these before they are all gone!","Date":"January 3, 2006"}

{"Title":"LG Delivers on its promises","Author":"Gregory J. Dedominick","ReviewID":"R1J8P629486T55","Overall":"good","Content":"I had been eyeing the LED market for a year in preparation to replace by HD Projection TV I bought back in 2003. Samsung was first on my list, but after some independent reviews (CNET, Consumer Reports), I decided to go with LG. This unit has all the bells and whistles at a competitive price point ($1,800 at the time of purchase) and the LG brand is gaining a good reputation.I was concerned about damage during delivery after reading the only other post on Amazon at the time I ordered, but the unit came in a timely manner and the person delivering insisted on opening the box and looking the unit over before requesting my acceptance. While I can see how the stand could possibly damage the front of the TV if significant force was put on the front of the box, my delivery had no issues.Granted, I had not formally seen the display on this specific model when I purchased it. I had seen the 55LE5400 in local stores, but the 55LE5500 was purchased sight unseen. I could not be more thrilled with what I got. I have the TV in a large room with lots of Florida sunlight. A minor tilt of the TV on the wall unit and I have no significant glare. The image displayed on the screen is great. High Def channels are pristine. Low Def channels, while they do show some blocky edges at times, are more than adequate. (The only Low Def channel we need if for some children's shows and the quality is more than enough for my 2 year old.)There are plenty of display controls to fine tune the screen for your room. The widgets are nice, but I wouldn't consider them a reason to pick this unit over another. 240Hz was one aspect I thought I wanted, but the TruMotion 120Hz on this unit has kept up with any fast panning motions displayed. The Clear Voice aspect has been great for late night TV watching when you want to hear the dialog, but don't need the booming car crashes to wake up the sleeping family. Overall I am thrilled with my purchase. I can clearly see the benefit of LED and LG has delivered on its promises. I would recommend this TV without hesitation.","Date":"July 12, 2010"}

To me, I thought the LG and Samsung models were the most consistent from store to store. Both have an excellent picture. It comes down to whether you prefer the glossy (Samsung) or matte (LG). I'll admit the glossy displays can look clearer under some circumstances, but reflections are an issue.  I chose LG.I saw more of the LE5400 in stores but decide to go with this model when a great price came along. No regrets there at all. The display is awesome with HD and Blu-Ray. The SD is better than my 46\" Toshiba. Noticeably better. There is some ghosting when the screen is completely black, it doesn't bother me. With fast action scenes you forget you're watching a television, it's so natural.One great feature I like about the set is the self-calibration process. Piece of cake. I have an AppleTV so I have not tried the streaming features yet. It's a downer that you have to buy a wireless dongle.My delivery from Modia was great. There is a review here that disses the LG packaging and it scared me somewhat. I honestly can't figure out what the guy is talking about. Apparently he has some type of ax to grind with LG or he's a Sony dealer or something.LG makes a great LED for a great price. I would highly recommend the 55LE5500.","Date":"July 21, 2010"}

I called Paul's TV and they said they would send me a replacement.The second TV arrived a week later, but this one was also flawed. It was unable to properly process a 1080p signal from my PS3. The screen would flicker on and off for 2 to 3 seconds every 5 to 10 minutes. At first, I thought it was the HDMI cable, but even after using a Monster M1000HD; the problem was still there. The only way to get around this issue was to set the PS3 output to 1080i. I called LG, they had me check a few settings, unplug and reset the TV, and then told me that the TV was defective. So I called Paul's TV again and just asked for my money back.Even when the TV was working, I did notice that the local dimming was pretty horrible. It was obvious the TV was edge lit with dark scenes, the local dimming caused large amounts of stray illumination and blooming into dark areas. It was so distracting that I had to turn off the local dimming and give up on having the deep black levels.I decided to go with a plasma this time and ordered a Samsung PN58C8000 (hasn't arrived yet). After researching, it seems plasmas out perform LED-LCD TVs. If you do get a LED-LCD, I would highly recommend that you get one that is full-array with local dimming instead of the edge-lit; it will help eliminate the stray illumination and blooming into dark areas.","Date":"September 24, 2010"}

They also said products fail - sorry.  DO NOT BUY ANY LG PRODUCTS.  The company has matter-of-factly implied to me they do not care about the consumer and at every opportunity will hide behind legalities to avoid culpability for any problems or failures of their products.  Using a pair of binoculars to watch your neighbors tv will work better than an LG.  I give this product and this company ZERO STARS.  THEIR PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE - BOYCOTT LG.

Im a college student and bought it coz it was very reasonably priced (Id compared many prices at the time), and also it was a good size. 19\" is big enough for home use, and certainly big enough for a dorm room. Its a simple tv, and has audio, video, and earphone jacks. The picture quality is good. The tv has given me no problems at all in these 2 yrs. Its been subject to rough use, such as regular shifting from one dorm to another every semester, and having friends come over and use it too and it is still running fine.  Also its easy to use, menu systems navigable easily with remote control. So overall I think it is a great product, and I am very glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a low cost but good quality tv.","Date":"January 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Glass panel front is VERY reflective","Author":"Bill in Virginia","ReviewID":"R16EXJW8SR6T65","Overall":"good","Content":"The great picture and good viewing angles for an LCD/LED were the reasons I bought this for our living room.  It did not disappoint with either picture quality or viewing angle.  But the EXTREMELY reflective glass panel covering this beautiful TV made it virtually unwatchable even though it was angled away from the main window.  The blacks were so black we could watch ourselves watching TV in the dark areas of the picture -- especially while watching movies, which tend to be darker than regular TV.  Many of the plasmas I've seen in the stores are less reflective, which makes plasmas viable options if you think you can handle a glass panel.  The TV has been returned and we're shopping for less reflective replacement.","Date":"August 18, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great TV set with amazing functionality","Author":"RZ \"no nonsense\"","ReviewID":"R1JQMO2N5BWFGL","Overall":"good","Content":"I got mine from a local store on sale for a little under $1600. That was about three weeks ago. And since then my entire family just can't get enough of it.Picture quality is just great - and that's expected. But what amazes me is all the extra functionality with what this TV is packed.1. Video streaming with Netflix. (It also has VUDU, YouTube, Picasa - but I did not try VUDU yet, and YouTube and Picasa work just fine, but I do not need a huge display to view some low resolution videos from YouTube). So Netflix movies available to watch instantly look great. Even those that are not HD quality. I must say that I have FIOS internet connection, so that must be also a component for high quality videos, but as far as this set goes - it does a great job.2. This TV has 2 hi-speed USB2.0 input jacks, and it recognizes not just flash drives, but also USB external hard drives - even with NTFS file format. I tried both - FAT32 and NTFS, and also external drives with additional power source and without it, - this TV recognizes them all. It can play your video files (and other media too) directly from external hard drive! And it supports multiple video formats, including Matroska H.264. It also supports external subtitles for AVI files. I did not test multiple subtitles formats, but SRT works great. It supports standard Latin letters languages and Korean. No other encodings though.I want also to add a few words about design. I use a TV stand that it came with, and it allows TV to be turned both sides about 20 degree - just enough to get to the USB jacks or to additional audio or HDMI jacks that are placed on a left side. The main ones are located on the back panel - which is also pretty easy to reach thanks to that rotating feature of a stand. The rotation is very smooth and requires no force at all.I can't be more pleased with it.","Date":"August 5, 2010"}
{"Title":"Everything I'd hoped it would be ... almost.","Author":"L. Sims","ReviewID":"R3DDOTAIOQPEYK","Overall":"good","Content":"Other reviewers have covered the technical stuff, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet.Pros: Outstanding picture quality in all modes, easy to use.Cons: Some screen glare, widgets not very useful.I've been very happy with the various presets and keep it in one of the THX modes most of the time.To give you some perspective, I've been in the video production business my entire career (30+ years)and the picture watching through my HD cable box is crystal clear.  I've watched 1 Blu-Ray movie and was very impressed.  I've watched football and there were zero artifacts during fast motion.  The screen is a large piece of glass so there will be some glare, as is true with any polished surface.  There is only slight flashlighting I've noticed when changing inputs but never during any programming, including really dark night scenes from the Blu-Ray.The audio is as good as the 32\" standard TV this replaced.  There are different modes and settings, but it is not going to sound like a 500 watt system.  Keep your expectations realistic.The widgets as of this review include weather, finance, a few games and others ... too many to list but as far as I'm concerned, they don't add much value.  There are NetFlix apps like VUDU and YouTube which work very well. These are worth paying some extra.  When I hooked up the Internet through an ethernet LAN cable, it automatically checked for updates...pretty cool.Aesthetically, the set is good looking and construction seems solid.  All the inputs are located in one place on the back panel ... no front or side inputs.  There are cable guides so you can semi-hide the wiring.  This works pretty well.In summary, I'm very happy with the picture quality, which is why I got this model.  If you don't see any updates to this review, nothing has changed with further use.","Date":"September 29, 2010"}
{"Title":"No Analog Audio Output","Author":"Wallace Guy","ReviewID":"RR50UX3KQM9NR","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture is beautiful.  The frameless glass frame is magnificent.  The speakers are so-so.We went to Best Buy to physically look at TV's, intending to buy a 42\".  Two things became clear.  The best imaging technology (e.g., high contrast ratio, etc.) doesn't really kick in until the 47\" models.  I guess there isn't a big market for high quality / small size TV's.  The other was the fameless frame on this model.  Every other TV in the store, bigger and smaller, had a raised frame that surrounds (and protects) the glass front.  The LG 478500 does not ... there is a single piece of glass that runs all the way to the edge.  The glass just changes to black in color in a thin region around the edge.  It looks more like a painting than a TV.  My wife spontaneously yells out \"that's magnificent!\" and I understood my TV just got more expensive.We bought the TV from amazon with enhanced delivery.  I wasn't there to observe, but my wife said they looked like they had never set up a TV in their life.  At one point they wanted to lay it on it's front, but with the absence of a raised frame, that would most likely scratch the glass.  They did get the TV in it's stand and sitting on the table, but not \"set up\" in any electronic sense.We bought an LG BD590 250GB Blu-Ray player to go with it.  I had read about various incompatibility issues related to various versions of HDMI or different manufacturers' implementations.  Given that the BD590 was among the top reviewed players, it seemed a safe bet.  That's the only source I have tried so far.  At the time of this review, we've watched Avatar and Cars.  I also watched a Hero DVD to check the up-sampling.The picture is stellar.  It looked better in the store than everything else we took the time to compare it to (more detail in the bear's dark fur, more subtle tones on images of snow). Until we get it up on the wall, we're sitting pretty close (about 8') and you can not see a pixel.  I don't have the experience of \"watching TV\" ... it feels more like we are looking through a window.The up-sampled DVD looked great.  It was obviously not as beautiful as the blu-ray disk, but substantially better than my gargantuan Sony Trinitron (the last of the pre-HD monster tube TVs) did with a DVD player.The speakers sound like TV speakers.  With such a beautiful image, I assume that LG assumes that people are going to add their own speakers.Which brings me to my one complaint, but this apparently is a complaint about the industry, not just this TV.  The rest of this review is more about dealing with audio for folks who don't have a home theater setup.This TV has no analog audio output.  Only an optical digital audio output.My setup is simple.  I have  blu-ray player, a TV and an amplifier with speakers.  That's it.  No satellite.  No cable.  No AV receiver.  What I used to do was plug the player into the TV, use the TV volume control with the audio output set on variable, and feed the audio signal to the amplifier from the TV.  It was simple. One volume control did it for all sources.That won't work with this TV.  I called LG customer service (which answered promptly) and they confirmed that only a digital output exists and that, \"all the new TVs are going this way\".  The first comment to this review confirms that.What the industry expects you to do is buy an AV Receiver for a home theater system.  Given that I just want good stereo sound, my problem with AV Receivers is that (a) the TV itself already accepts 10 different inputs and I don't need another box to accept 10 more, (b) it adds another remote control and (c) another volume control and (d) another input select function to watch a simple movie and (e) I'm paying for video up-conversion and other video features I don't need.  My understanding is that the latest HDMI may solve the dual-volume issue.Update: 8/10/2010It's worse than I thought.  From LG customer service:  \"Regretfully, the optical output is a fixed output on this unit, and it will not respond to the television's volume.\".  Thus, it is not possible to connect an external DAC to the optical audio output ... unless you like listening exclusively at full volume.Update: 8/11/2010If you want to use external stereo speakers without buying an A/V Receiver, here are the options that I have found:1)  Almost no-cost solution:Use the headphone jack and run that to your amplifier with a mini plug to RCA adapter cable.  It works, but the quality is about what you would expect ... very compressed sound.  I had to turn the TV volume up to 100% much of the time.2)  Low-cost solution:Use the headphone jack as above, but add a headphone amplifier.  This is the solution I have chosen.  I'm using a Creek OBH-11.  It costs about $200 and is the lowest priced headphone amplifier that audiophiles don't absolutely scoff at.  The Creek has an audio output that you hook into your speaker amplifier and a headphone jack, so you can still use headphones.  This won't improve distortion or frequency response of your sound, but it will improve the dynamics.3) Middle of the road solution:I looked for an HDMI box that might do something similar to an A/V Receiver ... sort of an AV Receiver Lite with a single HDMI input, a pass-through HDMI output, and audio out. Really what I want is an \"Audio Receiver\" to decode HDMI audio without any video.  The closest thing I have found is the Ambrry AU-HDMICP with the very long name of \"HDMI LPCM to Analog Multi-Channel Audio Decoder With Amplifier\".  It's a unique product and it almost does what I want ... but has no volume adjustment.The other option is a Beresford TC-7520.  It's a headphone amplifier with an optical digital input and a manual volume control, and costs about $200.  So ... this works.  You would have to adjust the volume by reaching for the box, which I would prefer not to.  Note one thing ... in the A/V forums this is a controversial product because of the very extreme claims of how fantastic it is and other people saying those claims are a campaign of hype.  For $200, I would not expect a top-end DAC in this product.So, in my opinion, there is no middle of the road solution.  The middle of the road solution is to spend your money on an A/V Receiver and be done with it.4) Audiophile solutionIf you want to put your money into the best audio (stereo) sound and not spend a dime on video switching, you can get the Benchmark DAC1 HDR or Lavry DA11.  They take optical digital input and produce RCA output for your amplifier.  They have nice little remote controls.  The specifications and reviews are impeccable. They are exactly what I want.  Also ... they cost more than the TV.  For $2,000 you could get a decent A/V Preamp, a more audiophile solution than A/V Receiver.  I might have gone down this road except that some A/V forum folks suggested that in a few years, these kind of products will start accepting HDMI and do full, audiophile quality TrueHD decoding.  That would be great.So ... for now ... it looks like if you want to listen to the audio on external speakers, even in stereo, you are pretty much forced to purchase an A/V processor or use the headphone jack.  So be it.Update: 11/30/2010I used the headphone amplifier solution (2) for a few months. It's OK.  But I could only look at those beautiful images so long without screaming inside for better audio.  I broke down and got an Integra 40.1 A/V preamp to go with a three channel B&K; amp that I had. So, after all my bellyaching about the state of the industry, I bought the box I didn't want to buy. The sound is good. I still only use it with stereo plus center channel.  My wife can't figure out all the remotes, so I'll probably also purchase one of those programmable, RF remotes.","Date":"August 5, 2010"}

{"Title":"Much to love and yet much to be disappointed with","Author":"BTX","ReviewID":"R4Y38XJ30FQSO","Overall":"good","Content":"I am writing this after about one week of use.Love:The thinness of this TV is super. Impressive. Admirable.When watching a high quality HD movie or show, such as that transmitted by HBO HD, the quality is stunning. Pleasing. Satisfying. Remarkable. And this is with the TV picture mode set to the standard default.The menus are easy to navigate.Nice that you can stream YouTube.Being able to rotate the TV 20 degrees left and right.Nice looking TV (except for the mirror-like reflection, of course)Happy I was able to get it for $1,800 grand total.Disappointments:While the installation of the base is really easy, the screws are easily stripped. Using a typical screwdriver, the screw heads started showing stripping. Unacceptable. (I didn't strip the screw heads all the way, but there should be no stripping just to install the base on an $1,800 TV.)The speakers. Come on, LG. If Vizio can put in 15 watt speakers, why would you give us 10 watt speakers on an $1,800 TV? The speaker sound is OK for programs like the news, but awful when listening to stations like the Music Choice cable music stations. I tested them with the beautiful instrumental music station and could not turn up the volume very high or else I'd get distortion and/or vibration. This is very upsetting. LG should be ashamed for this. And please don't tell me they expect everyone to connect the TV to an audio amplifier, etc. This is BS. Many people do not want to do this. And isn't $1,800 enough? And again: if other TV companies can offer a flat-screen TV with better sound, LG should be able. I don't have an amp or external speakers, etc. And I don't want to spend any more money. (I am not returning the TV in spite of this speaker complaint. I am just going to live with the disappointment for now. I am just hoping someone at LG will read these complaints and do the right thing in their next TV.)I am disappointed with the quality of the picture when standard def or video via composite RCA cables is transmitted. I know this is to be expected, but I have seen better quality on other sets. If you are still using something like the ReplayTV DVR or VCR where you can only use composite cables, you might be unhappy with the quality of the picture.The remote control does not have a qwerty keyboard. Not a dealbreaker, of course, but Vizio has a qwerty keyboard bluetooth remote with their 47\" LED LCD TV. And their set is $1,400. (And their speakers are better.)The glare of the screen. Highly reflective. If your room lighting is a certain way, you'll certainly get used to it and/or the glare will be less. (With the TV off in a bright room, the screen is a perfect mirror.)Bottom line: I recommend this LG TV if you watch mostly High Def programming, as you will see a gorgeous picture. Nice black levels. Bright and colorful and crystal clear picture that will make you fall in love with watching television. You will never want to go back to a CRT again if this is your first HD experience, of course. (I would give 5 stars for just the picture and the thinness of the TV.) If the best sound quality is important, keep in mind you will need external speakers for that.","Date":"August 17, 2010"}

{"Title":"Amazing Picture, LED local Dimming iffy","Author":"Tallguy1802","ReviewID":"RKQ9S3QTWPQSE","Overall":"good","Content":"OK let me start by saying that this TV looks amazing.  I have mine on the stand it that looks great.  Overall very sleek and stylish.  In a bright room, the glare may be an issue, but if I turned the lights off behind the couch, its fine.  the glare is only an issue in dark scenes.  But thats not the least of worries in dark scenes...The idea of the LED local dimming is excellent.  I bought the TV thinking it was an additional feature, but in normal TV and bright scenes the local dimming works well - especially when there is only a small portion of black and the rest is lighter.  However when you watch a horror movie, for instance - The Strangers, which is very dark with few light portions, the blooming around the lighted spots is ridiculous.  I had to turn the local the dimming off when watching this movie last night.  The response rate is great, but it is definitely noticeable when the LEDs switch on an off as the camera moves.  Also, on very bright screens, like an Apple commercial for example, from certain angles you can see the grid of LEDs lighting up.  There are very subtle darker lines in between the rows of LEDs which is starting to annoy me.  With that said, for almost everything besides extremely bright and extremely dark pictures (with a little bit of light) the picture is outstanding.  I've seen the edge-lit LEDs and definitely notice the blooming on those as well during the same extremely light and dark scenes, so its a matter of personal preference.I would highly recommend this TV, plenty of inputs, awesome picture -just that one annoying issue on extremely light and dark scenes.","Date":"October 21, 2010"}
{"Title":"First large flat panel purchase","Author":"skuter7199","ReviewID":"R30A336TQ8AQ4Y","Overall":"good","Content":"This was my first large flat panel purchase I've made, so I did a bit of research and shopping.  I've only had the tv for just under a week and so far I'm loving it! (Of course, that's easy to say when you replace a 27\" crt tv!)  I only rated the tv at 4 stars because I have not had it long enough to confidently apply 5 stars yet.  The tv arrived in perfect shape.  The first minor issue I had was after assembling the tv stand and setting it in place, I noticed the tv was tilting to the right.  Layed it back down, loosened the screws and was able to shift the stand straight.  I used a tape measure so that I would not have to repeat this process a 3rd time.  Set the tv back in place and it was perfect.  The glare, as many other reviews mention, was a distraction.  The windows directly behind me could still be seen even with a brighter picture on the tv.  I knew this potential going in, so I had a second location already in mind I was able to place the tv with no windows behind me.  Since changing the location, I am very happy with it.  Now, I just need to suck it up and get the HD package from the satellite provider!","Date":"December 8, 2010"}
{"Title":"A good TV, but a TV w/o sound should not be shipped from the factory","Author":"Halfzero","ReviewID":"R2LB6TXADQKUJB","Overall":"good","Content":"When I turned on the 47LE8500 I received, everything worked, except there was no sound from the speakers. After making sure that it was not the setup problem, I concluded that I received a defective unit. I was very upset, thinking about disassembling the stand re-packing the unit, obtaining the RMA, making an arrangement for pickup, and etc. This is a waste of time and money. The unit was shipped from Vanns. I have 14 days to return for a full refund, but I have to pay for shipping it back.Thinking about the hassle of returning the unit, I thought I should open it up and see what I can do. I am an EE, done quite a bit of display designs from CRT to LCD. I know the manufacturing test process on product like this at the factory. It is unusual that a unit w/o sound could have passed without noticed. The unit w/o sound could have caused by intermittent connection that happened to be OK when it was at the factory, but became loose connection after that. With that in mind, I decided to open the back cover and look.From what I saw, the 47LE8500 was very well designed. The main board is where nearly all external connectors are mounted. There are only 2 or 3 board assemblies and minimum wiring. The power supply, the most vunerable module in any electronic appliance, was well designed and thin. The only thing I don't like is that the power supply uses no-name cheap 105C electrolytic capacitors (e-cap). Given the 100,000 hours LED life, these e-caps could fail 10 times or more sooner. Other than that, I am impressed with the design and engineering of this TV.Based on my assumption above, I looked at audio system starting from the speakers . There are 4 of them, 2 for left and 2 for right. I discovered that one of the speaker terminals touched the aluminum chassis. Even though there is a plastic insulator on the terminal, I noticed a burn mark on the aluminum caused by arcing from speaker's terminal. I bent the terminal away from the aluminum chassis and reinstalled the insulator. Before turning it on, I traced the speaker wiring to the audio amplifier located on the main board. The amplifier is a class-D amplifier (NTP-7000)using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique for better efficiency. I felt much better knowing that this kind of amplifier has internal output short circuit protection. The chip should not have been damaged by the short circuit I discovered. I put everything back together, turned it on, and voila...I had sound.OK, here are my comments for all parties involved:Vanns:They did excellent job, TV arrived 3 days after ordering in good shape. They put the original LG box into another box, making it a double packing.LG design Eng:I would take away 1 star for giving a chance of short circuit to happen by design.LG Mfg:I would take away 4 stars for failing to catch this problem. Seeing the black mark, I knew that this problem was intermittent since it was at the factory.The TV itself is of high quality and I love it. For the reflective front glass that many people don't like, I think this is a trade off of having a glass panel vs w/o glass. It is good if you can control light in your room, and could be annoying if you cannot.Update (2/24/11)As many other reviewers pointed out, there is a 0.5mm thick plastic attached to the front glass. I suspect that over 90% of owners do not notice this transparent plastic that covers the entire TV faceplate. It is not obvious for its purpose as it is not explained in the manual. I think it is for protecting the glass before reaching the end user. It seems like you could leave it on forever, but it could be an issue later when it get old, accumulating scratches, and becomes harder to remove. LG Customer Support had no clue, but suggested removing it. It is extremely difficult to reove. It took me 45 minutes to remove it. This is absolutely unacceptable. It is somehow the reflection of how LG works internally as an organization. Some groups are excellent, but some groups are so inferior. In this case, the 47LE8500 is their portrait. I hope that some bigwigs at LG will see my comments here and do something.","Date":"February 2, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great color reproduction, some issues with the back lighting.","Author":"D. Mak \"nedoobie\"","ReviewID":"R10BL4ADFDAS6K","Overall":"good","Content":"Other reviewers have covered the features well. I hope to address areas that I felt weren't focused on by others. I'm happy with this, my first HDTV of this size. For me, this was an upgrade from a 25\" 1080p LCD monitor. My input sources are:Pioneer VSX-1120K AV receiverTiVo Premier XL (service from Comcast HD and ATSC via OTA antenna)XBox 360First I'll speak of the applications embedded with the TV. I find myself surprised at how much I access them. I originally expected to use them sparingly, if at all.Since I've had the LG 47LE8500 setup, I've had two firmware updates, so it's nice to see the manufacturer support the product. If you connect the unit to your network via. the built-in ethernet port, it will automatically check for firmware updates when you access the internet applications. I've not tested this with the optional wireless adapter, which I don't have nor need. Most firmware changes appear to be with the internet applications embedded with the unit: Netflix, VUDU, You Tube, Yahoo Widgets. All the applications work well. At the moment, the only application that supports 1080p with 5.1 Digital audio (via the TOSLINK, for me) is VUDU. I'm not sure if Netflix or YouTube will be updated in the future to support 1080p or 5.1 digital audio in the future. I believe Netflix has introduced a few clients capable of both, but with limited content supporting full HD. The highest supported resolution at the moment appears to be 720p for the LG installed Netflix app. Interestingly, despite having the Netflix and You Tube functionality duplicated on my TiVo Premier, I find it more convenient accessing them directly from the TV's implementation, sacrificing sound quality, just for the convenience of not having to turn on the other devices required to view the same content via. the TiVo. Since I have a TOSLink audio connection from the TV to my receiver, I can get better audio quality from these applications just by turning on the receiver, and muting the TV audio.In my opinion, this is a well designed TV. There are plenty of input and output ports, it runs cool, and most importantly, the display is brilliant. The color reproduction is incredible, from my point of view. I haven't had it calibrated, but a simple image check with some blue lenses and a video calibration video resulted in no tweaks or adjustments required, other than setting the video mode to one of the LG provided configurations: THX/Cinema. The source for this test was the TiVo Premier connected via. HDMI through the Pioneer receiver.The full local dimming feature of the TV makes for some incredible blacks in a fully darkened room. Unfortunately, I have observed a few instances where the back-lighting does bleed through. Possibly related to the full local dimming back-light implementation, I can see a horizontal banding effect apparent when displaying a screen of either white or blue/sky blue. This will probably be most visible watching Ice Hockey or scenes showing a lot of daytime sky. Since the bands appear to be static, I'm guessing it's related to the LED full array local dimming back-light. For me, this is a sufficient trade-off, for the brilliant color reproduction, and deep blacks.Another source I have connected to the TV is a XBox 360 game console. For that input device, I needed a TV with flexibility to disable whatever display processing that might introduce input lag. I'm happy with this unit in that it has not appeared to introduce any discernible input lag when I disable the TruMotion or any video upscaling options on both the TV and AV receiver. I have noticed some audio/video sync issues with some television programs from the TiVo input source when I was playing with the TruMotion adjustment options in conjunction with the video processing features available on my receiver, but that's to be expected.I'm very happy with the LG 47LE8500. I had very specific requirements going into my purchase. I researched my options extensively and came to the conclusion this TV met my requirements best, and I'm happy with that.","Date":"November 19, 2010"}

{"Title":"Love this TV","Author":"Mike In Kennesaw","ReviewID":"RZVCGQP4E2GNX","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV from Amazon and it actually shipped from Vanns. I had been patiently waiting for the right TV at the right price to upgrade from my 5/6 year old Samsung 720p, 60 Hz DLP TV. (Lots of acronyms there) When Amazon/Vanns dropped the price of this 1080p/240Hz TV under $1,300, I knew the time was right. The shopping experience with Amazon and Vanns was superb. It arrived on time. It was heavier than expected, but the FedEx guy helped me bring it in the house and I gave him a tip for his extra effort. Set up was a breeze for me. It replaced a 50\" DLP, so it is just a bit smaller. The TV has a plastic cover over the glass screen. I tried to get it off, but I think that it had been super glued in place. I called LG to make sure that it was supposed to come off as the manual never mentioned removing it. The lady told me it comes off easy. Well, easy must be a relative term because I could not get it off. I just set it up with the plastic in place. About a week later, a friend's son dropped by and said he thought he could get the plastic off. We took the TV down and placed it on cushions on the floor. He and I both were finally able to get the plastic off after about 30 minutes and a lot of sweat and muscle. I think pulling teeth may have been easier. However, once we reattached the TV without the plastic, I could not believe the picture quality. It was amazing!!!The only audio out is digital optical so I never hooked that up since my TV is about 20 feet from the surround sound system. I play audio through a surround sound system with Klipsch speakers anyway, so who needs the TV sound. However, I did buy a couple of optical audio cables to connect from my Dish receiver and Blu-Ray player to my sound system. I am now seeing and hearing Dish content and Blu-Ray movies like never before. And the Super Bowl was incredible, commercials too!!! The picture is so clear that I never realized how much make-up news casters and TV/movie stars wear.I absolutely love the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It was the first movie I watched in Blu-Ray on this amazing TV with the digital optical audio. It was like I had never seen these movies before!!I am one happy camper, although I probably should have gone to the zoo to get a Gorilla to remove that plastic cover. I highly recommend this TV as long as you can remove the cover. I would buy another one if I had a place to put it and could get my friend's son to peel the plastic off!!","Date":"February 10, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great TV overall, but not without cons","Author":"Ashwin Venkatraman","ReviewID":"R3KXUSAVOCDJY9","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm not a TV expert by any means but I did my research before buying this TV.  This pretty much gives you what most reviews have said about this.  The picture quality is amazing, the controls are easy, and the swivel base is very useful for connecting things behind the TV.  The bad piece is that the TV is extremely reflective. You will want to watch your darker movies at night with the lights turned off.  Another bad piece is that LG supplies really poor screws for the base.  I had read enough about this that I was very careful putting it together, but the screws strip very easily.  Also, just FYI, this TV is much heavier than its 47inch LG counterparts.  The only thing I could think of was that LED local dimming makes the TV heavier than the edge lit TVs but like I said I'm not a TV expert :)","Date":"February 3, 2011"}

To be candid, the reason I got this one was primarily around the price for the features.  I was pleasantly surprised that I could get this TV for less than some of the others, Samsung, in my wish list.  This had features that the more expensive TVs did not such as 240Hz and Internet connectivity.The seller is a company called Vann's and I was very happy with their customer service rep. I had wanted the TV expedited and I called them to work out the details.  They refunded the extra money when they told me they only ship via ground.  At first I was disappointed, but then pleased when they indicated it would still arrive within 3 days.  The TV arrived right on time and FedEx had called the day before to let me know it would arrive the next day.  The box had another larger box with padding to protect the TV - very nice touch.  I would definitely order from Vann's again.","Date":"January 22, 2011"}

This is not a big problem for me but I do have one major complaint about the design.  The panel is thin and would normally look great on a wall but most of the inputs face to the rear.  Wall mounting makes these inputs useless unless you create a fairly deep cavity in the wall to allow plugs to be connected.  It would have made far more sense to face most of the inputs to the side or preferably down to make wall mounting more practical.","Date":"December 14, 2010"}

All the other LED TV's I have tried all look fake, the red and blue are so in your face that it takes away what the picture should look like.  Yes, this does have a glare due to the glass screen so make sure you don't put it next to a window or a lamp.  I have noticed that less expensive LCD TV's don't have this reflection, check out the plasma TV's.  I like the Samsungs but the shadow detail just wasn't there, you adjust and it made everything else lighter.  The LG has plenty of fixed picture selections which I liked because I want to buy a TV and turn it on and watch it and not have to worry about spending another couple hundred dollars to calibrate it, what a scam 'BEST BUY'.  One thing to look out for the new LG LX9500 just has the 3-D feature and is not worth the huge price increase, it's the same TV as the LG LE8500.  The TV is very heavy so be careful and have someone help you hang it or just getting it out of the box.  The sound sucks like all 10 watt LED TV's do, buy a sound bar they come in so many sizes now. Compare the specs you are getting a lot of TV with this LG and if your worried about quality just buy the extended LG service plan.","Date":"November 24, 2010"}

Long story short everything I read pointed me to this unit.  I then checked the unit and setup at many locations until I finally pulled the trigger.  The main concern I had prior to purchasing this unit was the glare that I observed as well as is documented in other product reviews on this unit.  This is a result of the solid glass panel which covers the entire screen.  In a room where light can be controlled, such as my office this is a non issue.  However if you have a bright room (lots of windows) DO NOT BUY THIS TV unless you want to watch only at night.  If, on the other hand, there is not much ambient light entering your room this TV will reward you with the best picture quality and fps of any TV in its class.  The knock I have on it which is not worth of a star deduction is that it does not have built in Wifi o be ready to purchase a LG USB dongle for between $30-$70.  I was so satisfied with this TV's performance that I bought one as a Christmas gift for my folks.  Be advised this panel is not 3D (which I believe to a be a gimmick for rubes) and only goes up in size to 55\".  It took it out of the running for my replacement  as my main home theater screen as I wanted a 65\" or above LED or Plasma.","Date":"September 1, 2011"}

It had great professional critic reviews as well as good customer reviews. It was an excellent choice for us and we love it. It was easy to set up and easy to perfect your personal preferences with the quality of the picture and audio. I did purchase a soundbar for the audio and it's great. The screen on this one is glass so if you have a very bright room, you may want to consider purchasing one with a matte finish, because it is reflective. We only have lamps in our living room for lighting so it works very well for us. If you have a lot of windows that face the screen, then I wouldn't recommend this one. Other than that, this TV has excellent picture quality. I also purchased the LG usb dongle for a wireless  internet connection and it was simple to set up and use. Took just a few minutes.

I set it up with no help which is no small feat as I'm not the handiest person.  The picture was perfect after some basic tuning with the picture wizard included in the set.  I reduced the red and blue saturation a bit and changed some other settings to ones I found suggested on CNET.  The quality is so good it's like looking through a window at the real thing.  I didn't have any problem at all removing the plastic film as noted by other reviewers.  We've hardly noticed any glare from the glass panel but I can say the depth of the picture is phenomenal, hence the reason they did the glass panel.  With 4 HDMI and 2 USB inputs it eliminated the hassle of daisy chaining peripherals together.  The remote has some cool features that bring this set into the 21st century such as Widgets that let you go to YouTube or get a local weather forecast at the touch of a button.  I can't report any cons to this set now that the price has dropped.

Kirkpatrick \"Sean Kirkpatrick\"","ReviewID":"RSYAX8G600XQU","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is mounted in a secondary viewing area on a full motion arm purchased from monoprice (ID 4926).  The picture is amazing.  Deep blacks and crisp colors.  My primary TV is the Sony KDS-R70XBR and the picture on this LG is definitely better.  The transaction with OneCall through Amazon was issue-free.  The TV was very carefully secured and shipped from WA to NJ without tripping the shockwatch device attached to the box.  I was a bit nervous about making this expensive a purchase for this fragile an item online, but was immediately more comfortable when OneCall followed up immediately to keep me informed regarding how the TV would be handled from the point of purchase to delivery.I also purchased the wireless 802.11n usb adapter and once switched over to use the wireless device (WPA2), the TV was immediately connected.  Netflix, Vudu, and CinemaNOW are all working great (though I tend to not rent from the latter two).All that said, the TV has its shortcomings.  I don't understand what the TruMotion functionality is actually doing.  I had to turn it off because the images appear to be jittery and almost accelerated when it is on.  I was expecting access to Pandora via the LG Netcast functionality, but that is not available to me.  It may be that it isn't available in NJ, but I felt this was misrepresented in the advertising and was disappointed with this since I am an annual subscriber to Pandora One.The biggest disappointment was the lack of capabilities around the built in DLNA media streaming.  The TV is also heavily advertised as being DLNA certified.  I have a media server configured that I had been accessing via my PS3 using PS3 Media Server.  Most of my home library is stored as .ts containers of h264 encoded HD movies with PCM audio streams (since the PS3 seemed to deal with this combo the best).  The DLNA usage was a bit of a gamble on my part, admittedly, because even many of the review sites mention that LG claims that it is possible but that it was not part of the review (cnet).  I converted a few of my DVDs to MKVs and these will play, but I'm still having issues with the aspect ratio.  The movie that I'm testing with is definitely widescreen, but is displayed as 4:3 full screen (squished) on the TV no matter what.  From my own tinkering so far, it supports low resolution streams ok, but can't handle HD streams.  For a TV that's really made for displaying HD video, this is a bit of a let down.  I still haven't given up and am trying to work out alternative methods to do this, but there is very little to no information regarding the TV as a renderer.As a TV, the picture is phenomenal when connected to an HD source or streaming HD content from Netflix.  The lack of Pandora and the DLNA streaming issues that I'm having are the reasons to dock the review 1 star.","Date":"January 9, 2011"}

So many choices but I definitely wanted something that would stream the internet and had a few other specific functions. This particular model had everything I was looking for. One thing I did not want and have no desire to ever have is a 3D TV so this model also was attractive because of that. It had come down to just a handful of choices and when this TV came up for $1350 with free shipping and no taxes I jumped on it and I could not be more happy with my purchase. Of course it will probably get even cheaper in the future but isn't that the same with all electronics?It helps if you research the proper settings for this TV to get a good picture because the default settings are okay but far from perfect. Once you get it set just right the picture is absolutely phenomenal.The reviews about the glare kind of spooked me but I don't find it that bad at all. Yes I had to adjust a couple of lamps in my living room to eliminate some glare but that was easily accomplished. The glass makes this a really attractive TV that's easy to clean and care for.I'm old school and I also have an analog stereo that I paid huge amounts of money for in the 80's and refuse to let go of so I had to get an audio adapter since it has no rca cable plugs. Here's a secret for those in the same predicament: There's a website called monoprice.com that you can find everything you need under $30 to accomplish this and it sounds great. The TV's own built in sound is not really that bad either, at least compared to my previous TV's.I really love the ability to watch Netflix movies and access my Picassa photo account through this set. If you don't plan on connecting your TV to the internet then you are wasting your money for this set because that's a key feature. Plus the ability to download updated firmware is fantastic.About the only complaint I have is it's kind of difficult to get to the usb ports in the rear. But that's minor and a short usb extension cable should solve that problem.","Date":"December 6, 2010"}

{"Title":"Amazing LCD for cinema!","Author":"Jason","ReviewID":"R15SC2EXC64DQZ","Overall":"good","Content":"While some complain about reflections being an issue, I have found that as long as I keep any sources of glare directly off the screen (particularly directly behind your seating position), glare is hardly an issue. Off axis viewing is superb, as well as color accuracy and contrast. I DO highly suggest you get your set professionally calibrated for the best viewing experience. (This model supports the highest level of calibration possible unlike most consumer grade LCD sets.)For use in a dimmed home theater setting, I have seen few sets that can equal the quality of the image. (with the exception of extremely high-end plasma displays costing many times the cost of this).The swivel base is both nice looking (glass covered) and proves to be handy when making connections on the back or for different seating arrangements. Wall mounting is handy, but be sure you use screws included with the set to attach the wall mount brackets. The depth of other screws could be too long and damage the internals if you are not careful.Drawbacks are the fact that due to the thin profile of the set, the sound from the built-in speakers is anemic but does play loud enough for general viewing. I highly suggest a proper home theater system for viewing movies, etc.A second \"drawback\" for some would be the fact that the set is quite heavy because the face is solid glass and the rear is metal (not plastic). Personally, I find this to prove the quality of the set inside and out, but it can be difficult to lift/move for many people. And you will want to go with a wall mount that can support the extra weight if you go that route. I have used a heavy duty double arm cantilever mount with no issues with the set for almost a year before using the included stand. Just be sure both the mount is capable of the weight AND the attachments to the wall are STRONG and very secure!","Date":"March 2, 2012"}
{"Title":"A very good TV","Author":"Jon in the Southwest \"Jon\"","ReviewID":"R1SB9Q6O6KIQQD","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this TV online from Vann's in November of 2010 and we have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since. It replaced a 2002 Sony CRT Trinitron for the living room. WOW, and what a differnce it has made! LG apparently does not make it anymore, but I am going to upgrade the software today from their website to see if they have added more apps and perhaps some other types of functionalities that I an unaware of.  As far as the screen and the reflectiveness, it is a reflective screen that can glare, but we have it in a place that is not too bright. This does bring up one point though, and this is that when using the Eco mode to reduce screen brightness and to use less power, the screen gets too dark for my taste. As I said, it is placed in a darker spot of the living room and I would not expect the Eco mode to therefore make the screen as dark as it does, but it could just be my middle aged eyesight not being what it one was; cataract formation perhaps...  Whatever the case, it is a great TV with so many functions and inputs/outputs. I can overlook the issue of the Eco mode being too dark for my eyesight. One output that we just began to use is the optical output to our new Yamaha sound bar. Since November of 2010 we have just used the built-in 5.1 speakers and they have done the job, but now with a soundbar connected thru the optical output I would find it hard to go back to just using the built-in speakers. Of course money is limited, so having watched this TV without a soundbar for over a year now I have no complaints about sound quality; in addition to this, the picture at 240Hz refresh is perfect for sports and set to standard brightness it is a pleasure to view sports games with! Not a single issue of blur for  fast paced sporting events.  I saw that someone complained about this TV only doing \"military\" time. What a crock. Most of the world uses a 24 hour time cycle because it is logical and easier. Having lived in Europe as a civilian, it is personally my preferred method of time recording. One does not need be a rocket scientist in order to add 6 hours onto 12 noon in one's head and say that it is 18:00.  Having praised this TV I must add that since technology changes so fast I would look around at the newer models before I would buy this one at 2 grand or even at 1400 bucks (which is what we paid for it, when it was on special from Vann's). There is a great deal of competition and  LED TV models are constantly being updated and/or renamed. This is a very good TV, but look at the newer LG models and other brands as well. Perhaps the side-lit LED models are better when placed in bright spot? Perhaps other models have better Eco modes?

I was not sold on 3D TVs and knew I wanted the LED for not only the picture quality, but also for the slim design. I've owned this TV for roughly 9 months now and I have no doubts whatsoever. Many people complain about the glare/reflection. My TV is currently sitting on a base stand that has a window facing it. While there is a glare/reflection, this is not a big deal, for me at least. With blinds closed its a non factor. Please note, there is a plastic film that coats the TV screen. I noticed this and thought that maybe it should be removed. After reviewing sites and speaking to store personnel, I found that this should NOT be removed. Bottom line, I love the TV and wouldn't change a thing! Strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a 46/47\" LED TV.","Date":"July 27, 2011"}

Since I was aware of the complaints regarding the screws I was very careful in using a philips head driver that was new and not worn and made sure to apply appropriate torque without stripping the head or causing other problems.  The TV could use more screws to mount the base but with the warning I was able to set the screws with out any problem.As for glare/reflections, yep it's got it, but so did the older tube TVs.  I'm ok with it.Really enjoy the TV.So thanks to you reviewers and for Amazon for providing the forum for such an information exchange.","Date":"January 26, 2011"}
{"Title":"Amazing LED TV!","Author":"SST","ReviewID":"R6MFZZ0E6EQ30","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this LED TV for almost a month now, and I do have to say - it's amazing. I do have to agree with a lot of other reviewers that the screen is really reflective. Knowing this in advance I purchased the LG LSW200BG wall mount. This wall mount is pretty amazing too. It allows you to have the TV almost flat against the wall or you can pull it out roughly 8-10 inch. to get at the hook ups. You can also swing the TV left or right and tilt it up or down. Angling the TV down a little helps with the glare. Sorry for the review on the wall mount, but if you are concerned with glare, this is the way to go. Shop around for the wall mount, I found for half the price that amazon wants for it. Again, I'm very happy with the TV.","Date":"January 23, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great picture quality and real value for money","Author":"DevD","ReviewID":"RVNHWXYIJAS55","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great TV. Picture quality definitely beats Samsung or Sony. It was extremely easy to setup. Netcast works great. Netflix movies streaming in HD look great. The glass panel and borderless design improves the aesthetics of the tv. Glare is there but it's certainly not a deal breaker. I have been using Standard mode and did not change in default settings. It works well. This is one of the rarely available full led HDTV and it's a great time to buy this as it seems deeply discounted from some of the online retailers. I directly ordered it from Vanns.com and everything was smooth.","Date":"January 17, 2011"}
{"Title":"A Great LED LCD TV for the Price","Author":"Phunphil","ReviewID":"R3380NA72UYQDN","Overall":"good","Content":"Note: This review is written for middle-of-the-road folks who just want to know if this is a good TV or not, and don't want to get into the nitty-gritty about constrast ratios, refresh rates, etc. (like me!).Summary: If you're looking for a reasonably priced, full LED LCD TV that throws in a few extra bells and whistles, you cannot go wrong with LG's INFINIA LE8500 series.Pros: This TV has a great picture. The full LED display provides excellent picture clarity, and I would argue that this set rivals some plasmas for the black levels it can produce. In a nutshell, the LE8500 produces the kind of image quality that you would expect from a new 1080p LCD TV (and then some).I have not had a chance to use the NetCast features on this TV (more on that later), but I'm looking forward to being able to access features such as Netflix, Vudu, and the Yahoo \"widgets\" that allow you to read news, sports updates, etc. without having to leave whatever show you're watching. Last I checked, however, NetCast doesn't include Hulu, which I'd rather have than Facebook or Youtube.I also really appreciate the functionality of this TV. The menu system is easy to navigate, providing clear symbols for the various inputs you might have plugged in and uncluttered menu screens. I also appreciate the fact that LG throws in two remotes; one for doing everything and one for folks who just want to \"change the channel or volume\".Also, though it's not important in the grand scheme of things, the aesthetic of this TV is really nice. It's slim design and glass finish give it a classy, unobtrusive look. I also haven't had any glare issues with this TV like other folks have, and I have my TV set up next to a large window.Cons: The biggest issue I have with this TV is its TruMotion (the feature that makes whatever you're watching look like a soap opera--good for sports or other \"live\" programming); I just don't see a big difference, even with it set to high. The sound quality is also pretty standard, though this isn't uncommon for most flat screen TVs.  Finally, I was also disappointed to find out that a separate dongle had to be purchased in order to wirelessly connect to the internet. Though in fairness, this is more the fault of the Frys salesman that we bought this TV from than LG's--he told us a separate dongle wasn't required.In closing, I've always been a Sony or Samsung guy when it came to my electronics and TVs, but LG has surprised me with this affordable and versatile TV. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.","Date":"January 14, 2011"}
{"Title":"Nice Television","Author":"Jason Dragon","ReviewID":"R3IBYYKS3TMSXN","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for 1 day now and so far I'm satisfied. The picture quality does seem much better than my old Sony projection TV. The audio with the built in speakers is a step down, but that I probably expected given the trend towards thinner and thinner TVs. After hooking up and turning on the TV my wired network was automatically recognized and 2 software updates occurred. The built in Netflix streaming app presented a very nice picture and has more features than the same app in my LG BD390 Blu-Ray player. A cable TV signal and a Blu-Ray movie both displayed nicely as well.I find this TV to have much less glare than my old projection TV. There is a film on the glass that goes to within a few millimetes of each edge.  On top of that in the lower left corner was a 4 x 9 inch sticker advertising the TV's features - which obviously is meant to be removed. But it was a bit confusing to me whether the film was meant to be removed along with it. The edge of the sticker was close to the edge of the film. The film was thick enough to make it seem like it was just meant for protection during shipping, but it was perfectly straight and blemish free. I contacted customer support and they said \"Please do not remove this film. That is a protective film for the panel of the TV. It is part of the design of the unit.\" The film does seem to also have an anti-glare property to it.","Date":"January 7, 2011"}

If you want it, better find another set as this set does not have that feature.I would love if the LG Netcast service had a option to check Facebook...what can I say, I'm hooked.  ;-)Setting this TV up was a snap.  I took it out of the package, plugged in the cable and ethernet, set my time zone, and that's all you have to do.  It's a snap.  The picture is great, although I did change the \"picture mode\" to \"vivid\" as I liked the way that looked.  Anyway, I'm happy with the purchase.  FWIW, We bought both the 47 and 55 inch sets.My only gripe, is that I wish that they had included a single, more richly featured, programmable remote control.  They give you two remotes, a mini remote that does just the basics, and a full remote.  I would love to be able to add my Tivo and cable features to their remote.","Date":"December 24, 2010"}

I did buy a dual-band N series wireless router to facilitate the wireless streaming capability (I bought the USB adapter via Amazon), and it works very well.

{"Title":"Great TV, shipping problem, reflective screen an issue","Author":"Leading Edge Boomer","ReviewID":"R1P14SAZZJ6SU3","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this to replace an early-adopter Sharp LCD (when the monitor was separate from another electronics box) that was six years old, with the goal to get far better video.  This has been achieved, and I sold the old one to someone who will use it as a 45\" gaming monitor--he may be disappointed with the response times.  I've had this product for a few days now, so here's a review of the process and the product.1.  Delivery: quite fast, I'm in NM, it was shipped from Phoenix, so I had hopes it would endure minimal handling.2.  Delivery condition:  bad.  The manufacturer's box was the shipping container, and it arrived via UPS with a long gash in the box, noted by the UPS guy.  The styrofoam packing pieces were also somewhat broken.  Turns out (by chance) that it was the backside of the product, but something got far in to make a little dent in the metal.  So I was anxious to get the product set up to see that it functioned correctly--OK.  A problem for LG:  When the two straps are removed, the top is lifted from the base of the package, but the bottom packaging is insufficient to hold the unit upright--be prepared to lean it on something.  Better, don't start unpacking before moving the box to very near to the product destination.The product is heavy--70 lb with stand, and requires two able people to handle.  I have a broken foot, but we were able to get'er done.I have bought LCD TVs via the Internet twice before.  They both came with a shipping box encasing the manufacturer's product enclosure, and this one did not.  AMAZON, ARE YOU READING THIS?  The manufacturer's box works when wrapped up on a pallet with others, and when taken home by a buyer from a bricks-and-mortar store.  IT IS NOT AN INDIVIDUAL SHIPPING BOX!3.  Performance:  excellent.  As delivered, even home mode was in carnival colors.  You can search online among \"expert\" reviews to find what they take as optimum adjustments, and modify as desired.  To me, it's completely realistic after that.I don't use the TV audio, so I cannot comment on that.4.  Reflective screen:  definitely an issue.  Daytime, our sliding-door blinds are not black-out, and viewing from my computer desk is a problem.  At night, we have to dim lamps or use others to completely eliminate distraction.  Evaluate this for your own setting, since your mileage may vary.There is nothing in the manual about removing what some have found as a plastic cover on the glass; apparently it is not to be removed.  Cleaning with their cloth has instructions to spritz the cloth with a little water, and use nothing else since, unlike computer monitors, the LCD is not exposed.I'll update this if anything happens.","Date":"July 2, 2011"}

So after contacting LG customer service they told me now another technician has to come and look at it!! so we scheduled another service. the new technician came and confirmed the problem (for each appointment I had to take time off work). So when I call back they tell me that the technician needs to come back one more time!!! At that point I gave up and just returned the TV.","Date":"December 20, 2010"}
{"Title":"Extremely reflective, Timer issues, Ghosting, Bad Cust service.","Author":"Garan Grey \"Garan Grey\"","ReviewID":"R3HN01ZP7U4YU4","Overall":"good","Content":"Got this in Dec 2010.  The screen is ridiculously reflective.  Powersaver/Autoadjust feature produces bad images, Local Dimming isn't very effective because the LED blocks are huge and any white letters on a black background will have at least 2 inches square ghostly glow around them bright enough to see across the room.  Replacing a 14 year old TV that had 2 timers, this has only one, The clock loses at least two minutes a week, and when you set the timer to turn it on, it turns itself off 2hrs after, even when you do not set an off time.  Did I mention the clock will only show military time?  Who are they making these things for?  Customer service is awful.  They won't send anyone out on weekends, so you would have to take a day off work, and the one kid they DID send (an actual LG rep) knew less about the TV and how it worked than I do.

{"Title":"Great set, but not perfect","Author":"David G. Beneke","ReviewID":"R24ORPUDHKFC13","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture quality of my LG 47LE8500 is outstanding, sharp picture, deep blacks, accurate colors. There is an infinite number of ways to adjust the picture in the expert modes, so you can make the picture look even more stunning. When shopping for a set, this one stood out above all the others in several retail stores I went to, in regards of picture quality and color accuracy. It certainly beat out the Sharp Quattron series, which is the 4 led technology, in regards to color and picture quality. A word of warning to those who purchase this set, DO NOT TAKE THE PLASTIC SHEET OFF OF THE FRONT OF THE SET!!! LG should have made a note of this fact, because I, like many others who have reviewed this set, made the mistake of doing that, thinking it was a shipping protection cover. Nope, LG says it is necessary for getting a better picture, although the phone tech could not say why. In any case,with mine removed, I have not noticed any difference in picture quality, the screen is highly reflective, with or without the sheet. Taking the sheet off WILL void certain warranty issues.I'll cut to the chase and tell you first what I don't like about the set, as in other reviews on this site (amateur and professional) and in forums, there is the issue of noticeable horizontal banding when the picture is very bright, such as sky, solid color animation (the \"Rhapsody in Blue\" sequence in the Blu-ray of \"Fantasia 2000\" is a great example) or light scenes. To a hard core purest, it could be very annoying, but the majority of the time you will not see it. The next issue is screen glare. I have my LG recessed in a cabinet and a dark viewing room so this is not a big issue with me. However, you will see reflections if you have windows, lamps and so forth in your viewing area, much like a CRT screen. The THX bright room setting will help with most of a rooms glare artifacts, and you can boost the backlight and brightness and contrast, however this will make the horizontal banding more apparent.No set is perfect, and the pluses, out weigh the minuses of this model. The picture is second to none in any category, the infinite number of adjustments and inputs will please the tweakers, like myself, and having worked in broadcasting and motion pictures for 35 years now, I find this set to be the most cinematic I have ever seen, in fact a Blu-ray on this set looks better than any movie screen, period! HD broadcasts stunning, Dodger baseball in HD is like being there. Also this set is very net friendly, assuring that it won't go out of date any time soon, and increases it's versatility. The sound on the set is okay, the true voice technology is good for getting dialog from a noisy source, but I rarely use it, as I have a very nice 5.1 sound system set up. The infinite sound set up does give you a sense of surround sound, but it is not as dynamic as a separate sound system, one shouldn't expect that anyway.I have contacted LG customer service regarding the banding issue, they are sending a tech to my home to hopefully address the issue. If this problem is taken care of, I will write an addendum to this review and bump the rating from 4 to 5 stars, which it will truly deserve.Addendum to review 4-26-2011LG repair came over to my house, saw the banding problem, and ordered a new back panel. A week later, the same LG tech came back, very carefully, and I can not praise him enough for the great care he took to pad furniture, equipment and so on. He installed a new back panel, and the banding is gone! LG is aware of the problem, so if you are bothered by this on your unit, have LG install a new panel. The picture is absolutely outstanding. The only issue is because of the glass front there is a lot of glare. My viewing room is very dark so this is not a problem for me, and if the back lighting and contrast are bumped up, as it is in THX Bright Room mode, I don't think glare will be an issue. Love this set and can not praise its picture enough.","Date":"April 22, 2011"}

When i received this product and it did not include any stand for the TV. I was forced to call amazon to help reorder the stand for the tv.

It took about 2-3 weeks for the TV to arrive at our house and another 3 weeks to wait for the stand which was not rushed at all. It took almost a month for us to finally be able to set up the tv.

{"Title":"A Value Buy","Author":"Fanliao","ReviewID":"R1WX46HPUWZSEZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Since money has never been a little more than scarcity for me and I do not want to necessarily living in a compromised way, I am a die hard value buyer in every category. When it comes to time to buy our next TV, there is no difference in my online buying methods. First I 'glanced' at the specifications - i know LED is next thing up from LCD or Plasma, so LED it is; I know 1080i is better resolution than 720i, so 1080i it is; if internet streaming movies is a possible then I do not have to wait for my movie to come at the mail box, then internet application TV it is. And we already know that we want a TV that is 42\" to 48\" in size.Once we kind of know what we want, then we compare the customer reviews and pricing of the suitable candidates. We've looked at Sony, Panasonic, Samsung and LG, and pretty quickly we realize that the LG Infinity has all the feathers that we want, but about at least $400-$500 less than the bigger brands, and the previous more than 100 reviews do not reflect anything that is alarming. Since we have had a LG plasma for the past 7 years, so we have already trusted the brand. So we decided to give it a try.Up to today we have had the unit for more than 3 weeks now, and I am happy to say it is indeed a \"value buy\" that we were looking for and we are quite happy with the purchase.Picture quality - my husband's rating is 'very good' and my rating is 'good'. Since I generally have a little bit more sharper eyes than my husband because of my photography training, I can notice some tiny pixelation in National Geographic Channel when the scenes are rapidly changing, that is when you look really closely. Other than that, all the other High Def channels look very sharp and vivid. (I recommend to simply check CNN high def channel and National Geographic Channel for your High Def TV - if your CNN does not even look good to you, then all of your other high def channels will not possibly look good; and if your National Geographic Channel looks superb, then you can be assured you've got a great high def TV)Sound - as other reviewers already pointed out, you will likely to be disappointed if you intend to use the audio that is directly out of the TV set. We already expected this and we do have a AV system to go with it, so this is not a problem for us.Internet Application - this is a tricky part at first. It wasn't very clear how to connect to internet until you read the manual and figured out that a specific LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi USB Adaptor is necessary to make it work wirelessly. Once the adaptor is ordered and used, it takes forever to find the home network and then it takes forever to set it up (it took me more than 30 minutes to figure out how to enter the WEB Key by using the remote control). When it was finally done, the downloading from Nextlix still seemed slow and from time to time it would lost the communication with the home network and we would have to start over again. Our TV is about 35 feet from the router and the wireless path includes about 3 walls, so we naturally presume that the 35 feet wireless distance is too much for wireless downloading. It is not! After we also purchased a Sony Blue Ray DVD with Wi-fi built in, I tested by using the Sony Blue Ray DVD to wireless connect the internet and downloading, boy it was a breeze! It turns out, the Sony Blue Ray DVD has no problem connecting our home network and the downloading was super fast! So the verdict is in - the LG LED unit is internet 'not so ready'! LG needs to improve a lot more on the software part to catch up with Sony!A last word about the the reflective glass panel that many customer mentioned as a problem that bothered them - it does not bother us at all! We think that the glass panel looks very very nice! It is a full piece of thick smooth glass with a black frame and thin outer transparent edge. Yes it is reflective, but the reflection is smooth and the overall look of the unit is very high end, much better than the LG Plasma we had before. The aesthetic look of the unit is a pleasant surprise for both myself and my husband!In my book, if you can save 30 - 35% to get 90% what you want, then it is a good value buy. As a matter of fact, the money we saved ($400 - $500) more than covered for our new Sony Blue Ray DVD player with Wifi build in (we paid $189 plus tax at Best Buy). So overall it is a satisfactory value buy for us!","Date":"January 23, 2011"}
{"Title":"LG Selling Defective Merchandise - Brand New TV Completely Unusable","Author":"Jeffrey J Freeman","ReviewID":"R3MCRQ4SJRQ92B","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this television because of positive reviews and a gorgeous picture. But now this television is virtually unusable because of defective screws that are supposed to attach the television to the base.I began assembling the television, and the screwdriver I used immediately began to augur out the screw heads, stripping them out and rendering them completely unusable. So now I have a half-assembled television that won't stand upright, and I can't even use it on a wall mount because the screw heads are too stripped out to get the screws out.Even worse was the customer service line. They accused me of breaking the television and told me I would have to pay $75 for a tech visit. I told them that the screws were obviously defective (a sound argument given that this was the first time I was using them, and I was using a properly-sized phillips-head screwdriver to drive in the phillips-head screws), and he told me that the technician would make that determination. To make matters worse, he could not schedule a technician at that time, and told me that LG would call me back to schedule an appointment. It is over 24 hours later and I still do not have an appointment.A word to anybody considering puchasing this or any other LG TV - save yourself a heap of frustration and don't buy from LG. They sell a defective product that they do not stand behind. I guess it's easier for LG to  blame consumers for LG's own faulty parts instead of taking accountability for their shoddy, defective product.","Date":"August 2, 2010"}
{"Title":"Good TV, but a few things you should know ...","Author":"WorknMan \"worknman\"","ReviewID":"R26ZOSWFLGGFM9","Overall":"good","Content":"Just a few things you should know before buying this TV, or any rear projection HDTV in general:1. If you live nearby a brick and mortar store that carries this TV, see if they will let you hook a DVD player up to it, and then get the TV out of 'torch mode' by lowering the brightness and contrast (easily done via the remote) to about 50 - this will give you a much better idea of how it will look in your home. Also, when you get the TV home, bringing it out of torch mode is the first thing you should do, as leaving these settings cranked up to the max could damage your TV. If you see this thing on display in a store, they usually have it connected to an HD signal running at 1080i, the best resolution possible. Movies on DVD will not look *quite* that good.2. These TVs don't exactly come ready to watch, as they require a little tweaking, especially this TV, as it tends to have a 'red push' that you'll need to get rid of. Doing this is not exactly brain surgery, and the Avia Home Theater guide (also available on Amamzon) is a big help, but you should at least be aware of this.3. Burn-in: While not as bad as Plasma TVs when it comes to image burn-in, you must be consciously aware (but not paranoid) about the possibility of burn-in with this set. If you're the type of person who likes to play video games (which usually display a lot of static images, such as health meters), for hours on end, you may want to go with an LCD or DLP rear projection TV, if you can afford one :) Otherwise, a direct view (conventional) CRT HDTV may be better for you.4. If you plan to use a component video cable for DVD playback, some people will say that the kind of cable you use doesn't matter. While the kind of cable you use does not matter on other TVs, it DEFINITELY matters on this one. From my experience, there was a HUGE difference in picture quality between a set of $30 Acoustic Research cables and a $100 set of Monster Ultra THX cables. After trying the Monster cables, I ordered a set of component cables from [...] which are about as good as the Monster cables for a much lower price. Even if you elect to start out with a cheap cable, you should look into upgrading the cable if you notice the picture quality is not as it should be.5. There is no HDTV tuner built into this set, which means you'll either have to buy the tuner seperate ($200+) or get one from your cable or satellite company, which will usually provide one for you. You don't need a tuner simply for watching DVDs though.6. About the look of the TV - previous reviewer said it doesn't look like the one in the picture. Actually, it looks very close, except Amazon shows the TV sitting on its optional stand - the bottom part of the TV is actually one piece, not two. If you want to see what it really looks like, search for the model number on [...]7. In regards to what the previous reviewer says about room size, since I have the TV in a small room, I don't think the size of the room matters, just as long as you're setting at least 6-8 feet from the set.8. For more information about these topics and more, check out [...]Hopefully, I didn't scare you away with all of this info, because this is probably the best 46\" CRT rear projection HDTV you'll find in this price range - I highly recommend it!","Date":"November 24, 2004"}

{"Title":"what more do you need?","Author":"Fisher Man","ReviewID":"R1N8T9CE0F82IB","Overall":"good","Content":"If you are looking at this unit, you are probably like me. A first time, budget-minded HDTV buyer.  I researched many units, and decided to go with this one because it was on sale for $999.Picture with HD: With HD (through Comcast) it is awesome. My friend has a TV that he spent $4000 on, and he says that he can't notice a difference in picture crispness.Picture without HD: It is at least as good as what I had on my 27\" TV prior to this.  It ain't crisp, but it is very acceptable for a TV this large.I do notice some \"artifacts\" on this TV. If you are looking at this level of unit to buy, you probably don't even know what that means.  I didn't!  It means that you see some \"streaking\" of white on fast moving images.  It happens so rarely, though, that you won't notice much.The TV has some great stretch settings, too.  I was worried that any signal coming in at 4:3 would look distroted when I stretch it to 16:9, but this unit has a setting that only stretches the top and bottom, removing letterboxes but not distorting the main pic.  It also has one that stretches left and right, making 4:3 fill the screen without distrotion.The sound is better than the sound from my 27\" unit.  It is all I need for my small room, until I get a surround system.Inputs:  It does have an HDMI input. I'm told that is the top of the line input. I run my cable and DVD via the component inputs for ultra clear pic.In short, get this TV. For the price, I have absolutely no regrets!","Date":"December 7, 2004"}

{"Title":"Beware of image burn","Author":"Read the Manual","ReviewID":"R3MJ42FGTUQ9M7","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Toshiba 46 inch rear projection TV in November. Decent set, HD looks really good. Good sound quality. Overall a good TV.This was my first big screen rear projection purchase. I'm not one to read the operation manuals so this problem I am having with \"image burn?\" is my fault. But the TV itself makes it hard to avoid this problem. I knew veiwing the PC on tv and video games are bad for rear projections. But so is watching the TV in \"natural\" mode. In the manual is staets a few time that you should watch programs sing the entire screen, no bars on the top and botton (widescreen dvds sometimes cause that) or bars on the right and left or the \"natural\" settings. OK, I'm fine with that now that I know, might have been nice if the sales guy mentione dthis to me :(Any how, when you turn on your set it always defaults to the natural setting. I have an HD digital cable box and it only uses the \"whole\" screen on the HD channels. So if Toshiba knows about this problem why not have the TV default to full screen? It's a bit of a pain to turn on the TV (especially since I use the cable remote) and then set the TV to a setting other than natural.I had the TV repair guy out (best buy warranty) and he said he sees alot of this with rear projection TV's but usually not in only 6 months of use. (this burning actually happened after 4 months if use) Replacing the tubes cost as much as the TV.Learn from my mistake if you purchase this TV :)","Date":"May 13, 2005"}

I bought this TV back during 2004 Thanksgiving sale from BestBuy and paid about $1350. It took about few weeks for the picture tube to break in and show its real colors ! Then I had a technician from best buy come over and calibrate it (as you may already know that Rear Projection TVs need calibration, but if you have the bestbuy protection plan they would do it for free at your home). Ever since then all my friends come to my place to watch the big games, movies and even to play xbox in widescreen - and everyone just drools over the picture quality. The picture is crisp, specially when watching HD content and watching movies on DVD. I do not watch analog channels since almost all of them are in HD now for a small difference of $7 or so per month. I looked at Sony, Samsung and Toshiba - Toshiba won the race by a mile. Here are a few things worth mentioning about Toshiba 51H84:- Picture is absolutely crisp- Colors are beautiful (try watching Shrek on it)- Even movies in 4:3 look great- Size does matter ! I was about to settle for 42 and I am extremely glad I pushed myself to 51\"- The multi-choice zoom feature will satisfy your appetite to zoom any sort of programming.- 7 inputs including HDMI (I use Component and am satisfied)The only negative:- Doesn't have a built in HD tuner, so you cannot use its cool Split (2 screens) and Channel Scan feature (split screen in 12 screens).  It has 2 inputs for Antenna, I connected one to the cable box and other bypassing the cable box, so I can screen the channels in analog (using TV's analog tuner) and then watch it in HD.There is a false rumor that Toshiba's doesn't do a good job with green - Not true ! Myself and few of my friends spent hours looking at 3 different brands and Toshibas (after calibration) does the Best job with all R G and B (Sony RPTV didn't do a good with Reds) !Calibration is the key - make sure you spent some time to tune it after few weeks of picture tube breakin period.I would recommend this TV as a big bang for your buck !","Date":"March 26, 2005"}

I re-adjusted it and it was fine... until it did it again, and again usually about a week apart.Then about a month and a half later, while watching  a movie, it did the same 'pop' noise, only this time it shut itself off. It would not turn on, and the red power light was flashing. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked.The service call was to be the following week, that weekend it turned off again, and this time nothing would bring it back.The service tech had to take the chasis with him and 2 days later they returned with it, saying they had replaced 2 of the chips, (related to convergence), and 2 fuses.The picture was much improved in all cases and I thought, \"OK, I just got a TV with a couple of bad chips.\"Exactly 2 weeks after the repair, it made a 'pop' sound and the convergence went out of whack. I re-adjusted it and it was fine... until it did it again 2 days later.

{"Title":"Great TV for the Money","Author":"Tom Welling \"Tom\"","ReviewID":"R3AL90S7GV4YDK","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have had this TV now for almost a yr. When I was looking at getting an HDTV I did so much research. I read a million reviews and user opinions. I first bought a 50\" Samsung DLP. What an amazing TV. Still to this day, that TV is the best TV for the least amount of cash. Don't get me wrong. No DLP is cheap. I put the order in at Brandsmart. Then I went home and realized that I didn't need to spend $3800 for a TV. That included a stand and 5yr warranty. So the next day called my sales guy and canceled the order. I first was going to buy this TV, but went with the DLP. Well after feeling buyer's remorse I got the Toshiba 51H93 instead. I got it for $1350. It came to around $1750 after delievery and 5yr in house service contract. I was sold!!!So about the TV. The remote is cool. It lights up Blue so you can see in the dark. The picture is actually very nice. It all depends on your connection. If you have HDTV from your cable them get this TV. Regular-Digital Cable is def alittle blocky, but not nearly as bad as most Rear Projection TV's. It has a built in converter to make even a regular cable go to 1080i. Don't expect that it will equal HD though. On a DVD or HD signal, the TV is breathe taking. I have had no problems, knock on wood so far. I have an Xbox hooked up, very crisp picture. There is plenty of connections (2 HD), and SD card reader (can take out SD card from digital camera and just plug it in and see your pictures-very cool). The speakers are amazing. I still can't believe that a TV has such a good sound. The bass is overwhelming. I actually had to do into setup and lower the levels. I have a nice surround system which compliments it well. But most of the time I just use the TV unless there is a big game or DVD on.If your looking for a cheap HDTV, look no further. The technology is definitely outdated (rear projection). But for the price you can't beat it. Just remember, even if you buy the best LCD, in a yr from now the new model will blow away your older one. So why spend $4000-$10000 on a TV that will be outdated in less than a yr. This is why I went with a Rear projection. I figure spend the least amount now for the best you can get, and then in a yr or two I can get a better TV. Just think, you can get a $8000 LCD now or buy one $4000 now and then in a few yr's spend another $4000 on a newer LCD. I would bet the farm that the second LCD will be far superior to the $8000 now. I think you ge the point.Well good luck in your purchase and enjoy your new Toy. Take care","Date":"January 28, 2005"}

I have a dvd and vcr hooked up to it and have to say the picture quality is excellent.Just a couple of things I have found out when I got the set that should be known.  When you get the set delivered wait an hour or so before you turn it on. This will bring the set to room temperture.  It may sound foolish, but if the components of the tv are cold and you immediately turn the power on they could get expand to quickly and could crack. The set may have been in a delivery truck for a day or two in a cold climate.When you finally do turn the set on make sure you hit the one touch control on the front, it automatically adjusts the unit for your environment.  One other thing. For some reason the manufacturer adjusts the contrast to 100.  I would knock it down to about half of that or whatever you are comfortable with.Remember this is a projection tv so the best way to view it is about ten feet away and in a sitting position.All in all, so far I am very pleased with the set and recommend it highly.","Date":"February 24, 2005"}

It has performed flawlessly for thousands of hours since then. As for its technology being outdated (RPTV), and its maximum resolution being less than the maximum available (1080i), I think it has taught me to sympathize with those throwbacks who hang onto their vinyl LP's.  As my ears are unable to distinguish between digital and analog sound due to a long history of attending rock concerts, my eyes still function quite well (with correction).  I find that the latest generation of HDTV's, especially with hi-res digital content, yield a very \"digital\" looking result. I also own a 1080p 120Hz LCD TV which often gives an unreal overly digital looking result. The anachronistic RPTV yields a more realistic experience similar to film IMHO.

There is HDMI input instead of the more standard DVI interface. You have to buy a $129 converter cable to use it. The DVI cable is close to the same price.The menu driven interface is easy to use and setup was a breeze. I got it the same day I received the new Star Wars box set from Amazon. I really love it.

{"Title":"Delivery and Defect Problems Resolved","Author":"Gail","ReviewID":"R2Q03WXMDQXKQF","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this product on Febr. 24th and it was delivered to my home on March 2nd.  The TV was unpackaged in the truck and carried just into the door of my home.  It was not turned on and inspected as promised in the Amazon shipping information.  My son signed for the delivery as I was out of town.  Upon my return, I noticed there had been delivery damage.  The fabric on the bottom of the speaker grill was scaped and torn when the TV had been dragged over the sliding-door jam.  Also, the TV had a manufacturer defect with a fixed black spot on the screen.When I contacted Amazon (via email), they initially said too bad--the TV had been signed for.  I contacted the delivery company and they said they would be responsible for the damage even if Amazon does not cooperate with the claim.  Through either my followup email with Amazon or the persistency of the delivery company, I was shipped a new TV so the problem was resolved with a little persistency. By the way, if you want to talk to Amazon, the phone number is 800-201-7575.I also asked Amazon to not penalize my early purchase by honoring the $100 gift certificate promotion that started Febr 28th.  Afterall, most companies have a 30 day low price guarantee.  Again, I was told \"too bad\" by Amazon. Amazon does have a 30 day low price guarantee, but promotions are considered outside of the guarantee.I contacted Toshiba about the defect and I was given the name of a local authorized service center.  The TV was promptly repaired by removing a small speck of plastic from the lens, problably dislodged when a cabinet screw was installed.  The service person said that he rarely works on Toshiba TV's as they are very reliable.Apart from the delivery damage, the product is excellent, despite the old technology. Adequate space and a wide viewing angle are not issues with my location of this TV, so I went with the proven technology, longer expected product life and much lower price tag. I still have an analog cable signal, so a high definition TV accentuates flaws in the signal.  Like all rear projection TV's, the blacks are not as intense and the picture suffers when viewed at wide angles.  I will not be able to fully appreciate this product until I have a HD signal. But, cartoons, video games, and DVD's are really cool.Prior to purchasing this TV, I tried to read a lot about the various technologies and I found the Crutchfield website to be one of the most informative about HDTV.  Crutchfield does not sell this old technology. I also looked at other various on-line dealers.  Beware of both delivery AND shipping charges.

{"Title":"One of the best plasma TVs, simply gorgeous","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"R3CMOIP3AO648A","Overall":"good","Content":"I usually recommend LCD TVs (esp. Sharp Aquos) over plasmas, mainly because the LCD screen lasts longer, is brighter, consumes far less electricity, and does not suffer the burn-in problem as plasmas.But if you are set on getting a plasma, this Panasonic \"Veira\" 42\" is one of the best plasmas on the market today.  This HDTV set (with built-in HDTV tuner) is fully 720p and 480p native, and can scale 1080i content gracefully.  (BTW there's very little 1080i content available right now.)  The picture quality is simply gorgeous, with brightness and details that rival LCDs.  Color reproduction is excellent, making watching Nature on PBS such a wonderful experience.  The screen's response time has improved over earlier models, so fast-action sports looks good instead of ghostly.  The Veira also has a Cable Card slot and although I haven't tried it, a recent New York Times review says it works seamlessly with Cable Cards.  (Cable Cards can replace set-top cable boxes; check with your cable provider for details.)To get the most out of DVD movies, get a digital-output (HDMI) DVD player from Panasonic, Sony or Denon.  These players can \"upsample\" DVD's standard-NTSC resolution and provide somewhat better video quality when you play DVDs on an HDTV like this one.  The Panasonic player in particular is a great value and a perfect match for the Veira.While I still think LCD TVs are a better value for the long term, the Panasonic, along with plasmas from Fujitsu and Pioneer, does give you the best possible picture out of today's state-of-the-art plasma technology.  I have friends who own Panasonic and they are all very happy, even the ones with the EDTV (instead of HDTV) sets.When you buy a big screen TV, you are making a serious investment (unless you just won the Mega Millions or Powerball), and I highly recommend you buy the best you can afford.  Sub-$2000 plasma TVs have poor image quality and are likely to break down quickly, plus they are very noisy.  Just go for the best after you get over the SAF (spouse approval factor) hurdle!  The Panasonic Veira is a great value considering its top-notch image quality, gorgeous styling and built-in HDTV support.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}
{"Title":"Great TV, and I wish there were more HDTV channels","Author":"Japinder Singh","ReviewID":"R3IHNNJZ2P3OPL","Overall":"good","Content":"After researching and looking at plasma, lcd, lcd projection tv's for couple of months, I finally bought this TV from amazon.com. Had it for couple of weeks now, and am amazed at the quality of the display. Got HDTV from comcast cable and the HDTV channels look and sound great. Of course I wish there were more HDTV channels. I recommend using the Monster DVI-HDMI cable. This TV has a HDMI port. I also recommend Samsung DVD player HD-931 that generates HD outputs via DVI for your DVDs. The resultant image quality is excellent, even though it is not \"TRUE HD\".An update. It has been a year since I last updated this review. This TV is still one of the best plasma displays in the market. Pioneer plasma is the only one that looks slightly better. I have added monster power supply to my setup and have replaced the cable with satellite. More HD channels on the satellite. Monster power supply is essential to keeping your expensive home theatre setup safe from power quality issues. Have also added Onkyo A/V receiver to my setup along with Cambridge speakers. Had zero issues with this display. Was a little bit apprehensive of dropping big dollars on this display. But so far, it has given awesome performance and zero problems.","Date":"July 13, 2004"}
{"Title":"Glitch in the TV","Author":"JDev","ReviewID":"RONU7C98XFXJX","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this plasma TV through Amazon 4 months ago.  The transaction and shipping went very smoothly. I also purchased the wall mounting bracket through Amazon (an excellent value for only $150).The TV is great -- excellent picture and great audio for those of you who do not use their surround sound system every time the set is on.  However, a problem recently surfaced a few days ago: When playing DVDs on the Component 1 channel, the picture on the screen is no longer centered -- it is offset by about 20% to the left side.  After trying to remedy the problem myself, I contacted Panasonic Customer Service (be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes on the phone before being connected to a representative).  After explaining the problem, the rep indicated it would warrant a service call by a repair person (as of this writing, the appointment is scheduled within the next few days) Luckily, the warranty covers in-house repairs for one year, but you do have to remove the TV from the wall mount yourself so it is accessible to the repair person.I'll admit I'm a bit skeptical about the reliabilty of the TV now, especially since it developed this problem within 4 months.  I'm not a fan of extended warranties (very expensive for this TV, considering an extra year of coverage through Panasonic costs around $400), but I may have to purchase one if any additional problems surface.Hopefully, the problem with my Panasonic is a rarity.  I  expected better performance from this expensive purchase. Time will tell.","Date":"March 15, 2005"}

It has all of the same tech specs (plus more) as the main competitors. It is bright and crisp. Normal TV signals (via a cable for instance) look lousy since the display is capable of so much more, and kinda amplifying the poor standard TV signals.  BUT, throw a DVD, HD or even DIGITAL cable signals at it and be prepared to fall off your chair! Amazing!This unit has LOTS of signal inputs, and the built-in ATSC HD tuner even finds HD channels my cable provider (comast) says don't exist on my wire!The unit suffers from the same power supply noise that nearly all plasmas do. Almost non-existant, but if you put your ear up to it with no other sound in the room, it IS there.The embedded operating system is a bit sluggish, and switching between video feeds is a bit slow, but usable. Also, it is quite particular in which types of image files it will display. I have found ONLY images that have been recorded on a camera work. Nothing that has been EDITTED first displays.Last note: The unit is plasma... which means it's USEABLE half-lifespan is something like 50,000 hours. What is a half-life span you ask? It is the number of hours that the set is operating before the BRIGHTNESS degrades to HALF of the original brightness. So, in 50,000 hours, the picture will be 50% darker than it is today. This figure of 50,000 hours appears to be higher than other sets. Good for Panasonic!","Date":"January 31, 2005"}

With the 'rabbit ears' I also receive all four major networks in SD---but why go back?DVD's seem to look better on the Plasma than on my last Mitsubishi tube set---even thugh there is only 480 lines of resolution.  I haven't tried the HDMI input yet, but others seem to be impressed by it.I am using component video for my DVD and run the sound through Yamaha Audio/Video controller, Adcom amplifiers, and Polk Audio speakers.The only bummer is that when the speakers on the Plasma are turned off, you can't adjust the 'volume level' using the Plasma remote---you just get a message saying 'speakers off'---you should be able to turn off the speakers and then have the audio out from your Plasma become a 'line out' so to speak---so you can control the audio levels of your surround system, when watching TV by using the volume on the Plasma remote control---why should I have to 'select' receiver and then adjust the volume?---heck that was available on my first Mitsubishi set 16 years ago.Anway, minor complaint....all in all a fantastic set, that I would recommend to anyone---and a great bargain too!","Date":"August 24, 2005"}

My Direct TV digital satellite feed looks very good, but there are image artifacts that result in occasional blurriness or distortion. It is a minor annoyance. My progressive scan DVD looks excellent, but still not perfect. (I do not have an HD signal as of yet, so I can't speak to how this looks). The manual is pathetic. The INPUTS/OUTPUTS are very weird. My 20\" Sony Wega LCD has all that it should, but for some reason, Phillips was really on drugs when it made this unit. In order to get the progressive scan quality, I CANNOT simply connect using a Component cable; instead, I have to use Phillips supplied hybrid cable. In fact, when I first tried the component, I got no image whatsoever... just sound. And although it looks like they have a multitude of imputs, several \"share\" a slot. It is very weird. And I simply don't understand a TV being built without AUDIO OUT. Speaking of Audio, the unit sounds just fine, exhibiting good volume and separation. But as I try out the different equilizer modes (Theatre, Music, Personal, etc.), I can detect no difference whatsoever.While I am happy with this TV, I feel that it is overpriced for what it offers; moroever, I feel it is advertised as having more than it really does.  This unit would be a reasonable purchase for three to five hundred less (which I'm sure it will be next year).

{"Title":"Not true 16x9: it's 15x9!!!  Beware black bars","Author":"Tiger Vijay","ReviewID":"R3MC9LW4UJRPJP","Overall":"bad","Content":"A true widescreen TV has an aspect ratio of 16:9.  For most widescreen LCD TVs, this means a WXGA resolution that is 1366 pixels wide by 768 pixels high.  But this Philips TV is NOT a true widescreen, despite the false claim in Philips specifications; its aspect ratio is 15:9 and its resolution is 1280 pixels wide by 768 pixels high.  So what does this mean in practical terms?  HDTV broadcasts (such as Law and Order on NBC and this year's Superbowl) are in 16:9 ratio; they fill the entire screen in a true widescreen 16:9 TV.  But since the Philips is 15:9, the HDTV broadcast will appear with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen (unless you choose to artificially stretch the picture to fill the screen, making it look distorted, with people  in the picture too tall and too skinny)!  Can you endure black bars at the top and bottom of your screen every time you watch an HDTV broadcast?  Can you accept the fact that the true usable area of the screen when HDTV is employed is less than the claimed 30\" diagonal--that there will always be wasted area at the top and bottom of your TV?  Do not make the same mistake that I did.  Do not be fooled by the false claim of 16:9 screen ratio.

{"Title":"Ok for the money","Author":"bobcobber","ReviewID":"R28SGFO1M4CT8X","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture is very good with cable hd and dvd (both progressive scan and analog component hooked up to AV1). Only one digital input allowed. This is a problem if you have two devices, such as cable box and dvd. However, the digital input only accepts vga or hdmi, so all component feeds must be converted to vga with cable supplied by manufacturer. I think that one could get an analog switcher with video component input and outputs for not too much money. The picture quality degrades with analog signals, even over digital cable. On middle brightness settings, shading and details in dark areas are lost. Correction by increasing the brightness helps to a limited degree, however, you start to lose the deepness of the black and get graying/hazing. There are better LCD TV's out there with better pitcures and two digital inputs, however, they cost a lot more.","Date":"March 3, 2005"}

The 32 inch actually looks signficantly bigger than the 30 inch model.  Is it worth the extra money?  I'm not sure, but Sharp's Aquos line is without doubt the best.  My belief is, if you are going to spend a lot of money, might as well get the best so you don't disappointed.","Date":"October 16, 2004"}

{"Title":"Very Happy with the Sharp Aquos 32G4U","Author":"J. Lawrence","ReviewID":"R5HCJWAPQKITD","Overall":"good","Content":"We've had the Aquos TV for a few weeks at this date and are very happy with the picture quality for standard DirecTV, DVD, and PC viewing.  We have not upgraded to an HD feed yet, but we were honestly surprised by the improved picture of standard DirecTV versus our previous television (standard CRT).Pluses:1) We have found the A/V box design to be great for hiding all the input cables.2) Sharp offers a couple of different stretch modes to choose from.3) There are 6 input sources and ability to assign custom names to each.4) The unit remembers the volume, stretch, and picture settings for each input source.  Sounds like a small thing but it is really appreciated by us.5) The Sharp menus and remote are nicely designed.6) Speakers sound good for listening to regular content.7) TV outputs for video capture.8) Aesthetically pleasing.9) Vivid pictures!10) The stand allows the screen to swivel and pivot for optimum positioning.  The degrees of rotational are small but effective.11) Works very well for PC viewing.12) Placement of the control buttons on top of the panel work nice for us.Minuses:1) Only one S-Video input and it is on the front of the A/V box. Won't be an issue after we upgrade our DirecTV receiver but it seems like an oversight not to include one s-Video input on the back of the A/V box.2) 1080p support is questionable.  This may be an issue in the future as true 1080 becomes widely available.  Perhaps the A/V box can be upgraded.3) Expensive.  We originally wanted a 37\" TV but could not justify the price.  However, we were so pleased with all the features mentioned above that we went with the smaller 32\" versus other less expensive products.4) We are not using all input sources, it would be nice if we could disable the unused inputs so they would not appear in the menu.5) Faint fan noise in the A/V box (this is probably a nit, it's only detectable if TV is muted).Thanks to all the previous reviewers on this product and other products.  The customer feedback really helped us make and informed decision.  It can get confusing with all the different display technologies available.  Also, some products have known defects that you will only learn about from internet research.","Date":"January 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"the TV lost sound...","Author":"P Turtle \"Turtle\"","ReviewID":"R2PQGGBPUQ7WUV","Overall":"good","Content":"i am writing this review because i lost sound on this TV a week ago. I just got the sound back and want to share how i did it (in my case).I bought this TV in late 2004, not from Amazon. The TV over the years has worked fine. A week ago the side speakers attached to the TV monitors lost sound. Luckily i was still able to get sound through external stereo speakers. But it was inconvenient because i could not use the cable remote control to control volume.Initially, i followed the instructions in the manual ('trouble shooting'). One thing to try was to go to Menu (via the TV's the remote control), then Option, then Output Select. But the Output Select was grayed out; i could not get to it. So i just thought the 32\" does not have this option (the manual is for both 32 and 37). i searched the website and got to a forum discussing the no sound problem; some people said the no-sound problem is related to a design flaw, and Sharp will send techinician to fix it for free, even outside the warranty period.So i called Sharp but no such luck. Sharp over the phone made me try various things, including getting to Output Selct, which was grayed out, and they had no clue how to fix that. i specifically asked if i should do anything with the AVC unit; i was told NO. At the end, i was given a Sharp service shop near me, which would cost me $65 minimum (understandable). I decided to do nothing for now; i thought maybe i should just get another TV.Today, God helped me! I read the manual again and decided to press Reset on the AVC system - one reason i never did that was because there is no obvious reset 'button' on the AVC; there is just a small little dot \"inside\". I decided to press the dot with the tip of a letter opener.... the sound came back! i then went to see if Output Select was still grayed out- it is no longer grayed out!!","Date":"March 6, 2013"}

{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}

Thomas","ReviewID":"R2FPBC09W1N2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"If you see this TV going for cheap and your needs are anything like mine, buy it immediately and resist all the techno-junk TV manufacturers are forcing on consumers.First, consider the input into your TV.  If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.

{"Title":"Do the RESEARCH the Olevia is tough to beat!!!","Author":"B. Smith","ReviewID":"R2ZJIKK9KUF366","Overall":"good","Content":"I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

{"Title":"Review of 30\" Olevia","Author":"D. Raymond","ReviewID":"R1Z8BRBTO47JLR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recieved this unit today.1. Packaging is absolutely first class.  The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!","Author":"Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"","ReviewID":"R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!  Great set, I'm really pleased.","Date":"January 6, 2005"}

The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

Oh wait, you ordered through Amazon, we cannot supply a replacement, you however can send that one back for a refund and then order a new one. Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV.

We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.

{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony).

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars.

No it does not quite have the picture of a $4000 or $5000 plasma or more-expensive projection LCD, but, it is simple to set up, has all of the appropriate connections (except an optical audio-out - bummer), and, plays DVD and HDTV beautifully.  For the small picture quality sacrifice (compared to units twice and three times its price), Syntax puts this TV within the financial reach of working-class folks.  Some bemoan the remote - it really isn't that bad.Buy with confidence - but - see it in person if you can before buying to better preset your expectations.  When compared to others in its class (by Westinghouse, Albatron, etc.), this machine rocks.","Date":"December 23, 2004"}

I wanted a second PC monitor for gaming. I currently have a 19\" trinitron and this may not be as sharp, but really looks great. For the price, having a 27 inch gaming screen is sweet. The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best. Anything other and my text/fonts looked unreadable. I was close to frustrated and figured this out and it rocks. I wish the TV resolution was as nice. Still seems grainy Maybe it is my cable provider too. I was able to keep my other TV connected to the cable box via the coax connection and using the svideo for my new tv. Side by side, I don't see much difference between a 10 year old toshiba and this new LCD. I do enjoy the PIP though while working on the PC and watching TV on the side. :) Very trick option. Even though the speakers are not earth shattering, they are loud enough for a bed room TV. Lots of connection options with this TV. Not bad for the 800-900 range.Hope this helps.

Was happy with it, I don't have a DVI enabled HD cable box from TW New York so use the ypbpr connection and thats fine - HD channels look great but not stunning - regular channels are okay but it seems that they carry to much red and the controls on the set don't fine tune it out enough. I have a DVD and the quality was just as good as the HD channels through the component cables.Then the problems started - A flash to a blue screen for 3-4 seconds when their was a large influx of bright light (usually white) and back to normal. Tech support were good and sent a part (new tuner box) with in the week of telling them about this problem.While waiting for the part I noticed that one speaker was not working and contacted tech support again, but this time it has taken 3 weeks for the part to arrive even though they kept telling (after 4 calls to customer support and 2 from them) me it would be here with in the week.Part finally arrives and we organize for a technician to come and replace the broken/dud parts - this is done today May 2 2005  but the speakers don't work. So its back onto customer support.First guy Miguel (one of these people who completely rubs you up the wrong way from the start - and its not the first time I have had the misfortune of speaking with him) - tells me its this and that and we will send another part etc...etc. I told him I wouldn't be happy with that and that the part they have just replaced is defective - I hung up to calm down.Second guy Chris - I tell him exactly the same as the chief muppet above and first thing he said was \"I'll organize customer support to replace the LCD Set with a new one\", simple as that, no ifs or buts,I'll give them a chance with a new set and see how it goes but after that its refund time.

Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed. I can aim the remote at the wall opposite the TV and the remote still works.","Date":"February 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best 27' HDTV-ready  LCD monitor in it's price range..........","Author":"micritt \"mic\"","ReviewID":"R34RA8GJSP5I2A","Overall":"good","Content":"That's because it's the ONLY  LCD-TV in this range that's available. I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).

I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

I will be using the cable box one until I get a universal one figured out.In conclusion, if this thing proves durable I will be very happy.

{"Title":"The LT30HV 30\": Nice picture, but some technical problems and annoying features","Author":"Brandon W.","ReviewID":"R3AL3QWUV4P3AM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV because of the reasonable price and mostly positive reviews.  I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"FAQ's missing.  Hopefully this will help","Author":"M. CLARK \"mc\"","ReviewID":"R1AFD57LAFBQK9","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw there were problems with the aspect ratio. 3 reviews below me says that the picture looks stretched. There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

Banks","ReviewID":"RL2K8XXMWXA3S","Overall":"good","Content":"I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable.  But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

(Its nice that Amazon does this.)TV #2 didn't fare much better.  There was that lack of packing material again.  When I turned it on it was even worse.  A bright, neon green pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Both TV's were nothing but static on channel 11, too!Amazon was great about taking both back without shipping charges.

I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

The ease of use and the quality of the sound and picture is staggering. I only wish I had bought a larger version. With what they say about the side to side problems in LCD tv's this one shows none of the degridation discribed in reviews of most of them. The sound is crisp and the tones, which are adjustable, are superb for the size of the speaker units that are detatchable. I highly recomend this tv. If you have the money go for the largest one you can afford in this brand, you will not be disapointed.","Date":"August 14, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

It doesn't have as many inputs as today's TVs do, it only has a DVI input, not an HDMI and 2 component inputs (one HD and one 480p) as well as a cable input. I've used a PS3 with it as well as a Dish HD receiver. When we had cable, I used a splitter and connected one input to the HD component inputs and another to the cable and thus enabled its picture-in-a-picture function. The picture is vivid and sharp.

Initially I was happy about it because pricing was good for that time and it had several good reviews.  Performance was very good in the beginning.  After a few months, a problem started, everytime you are watching a bright scene (i.e. an explosion, a really white/bright scene like snow) the screen would turn to blue (like a computer).  It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.  It progressively got worse until turning it off and on didn't work anymore.  Around early 2007 we gave it up for dead.","Date":"September 5, 2007"}

Blacks are a little off, but not bad.Sound is terrible.  Throw out speakers as soon as you get this TV, they are worthless.  I think that is the reason they made them detachable.  If you try and hook up an satalite speakers threw the audio, they will not work.  An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.  For almost as much as the TV, you can get DirecTVs HD equipment - but that will only make HD shows look better.  All the other channels will still look like a blown up JPEG.","Date":"August 8, 2005"}

It is in the bedroom, and used as both a TV and as a computer monitor.The TV performance is very good.  Hooked up to cable (RCN).  Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  View TV from 13feet - picture size comfortable.  Also, the remote works fine from 13feet away. [remote model RC-LTS]As a computer monitor - PERFECT.  Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  I can comfortably sit at the desk with the TV approx. 24inches from my face and work at the computer.  NO MORE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING!!!  Also, to do picture adjustment (menu - picture - auto adjustment - press volume up key) ---> use remote.Did try to use the DVI cable (from a previous monitor) - but only worked sometimes.  Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.

{"Title":"Standard Cable Stations Do Not Come In","Author":"Chris","ReviewID":"R1GM3ID81NNYA0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Don't buy this TV if you plan on watching channels that aren't HDTV.  I bought a LT30HV and I must say that the HDTV channels look outstanding as do DVDs and video games.  However, the reception on normal cable channels is horrible.  This is not to say that it is only bad compared to other HDTVs, but it looks much worse than any reception I have ever seen.  It looks like a very bad UHF signal from pre-cable days because everything is very blurry and it looks like its snowing on every analog channel.  Its basically unwatchable.  The digital channels are slightly more tolerable.  But I have a 5 year old $100 piece of crap 20\" sharp TV that gets crystal clear reception from the same cable box and connection.  I have talked to Syntax about this and they assured me that it was the signal coming into the TV.  Since then I have changed cable boxes, used different wires, tried different inputs, had the cable company install a signal amplifier, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem.  My cable provider (Comcast) offers mostly analog channels for the most popular stations, digital channels for the higher number cable channels and a few HDTV channels.  If your cable provider is the same way, I would STRONGLY advise against buying this unit.  Other than the fact that you can't watch about 75% of the channels from my cable box, the only other complaint I would have is that the remote is very poorly designed.  Also, now that it has taken me a little over a month to figure out that it is absolutely the TV that is causing this, I don't have the opportunity to return it anymore.  So I paid $1000 for this unit to watch a few HD channels... what a ripoff.EDIT:After having this TV for a while, I think my criticism was much too harsh.  Its still true that some analog channels don't come in and the remote is absurd, but I am happy with everything else about the TV.  For some reason about half the analog stations come in fine and half are somewhat fuzzy, though I have noticed similar things with other HDTVs.  The picture on the digital channels actually is fine, I think its a bit underwhelming due more to the signal coming through my cable box.  The picture on the HDTV channels is spectacular.  Maybe other high end TVs reportedly have better colors or whatever but I'm telling you that watching football, baseball, basketball, nature shows, etc is mesmerizing.  Some other nice features that I have discovered are the removable speakers that can be wired directly to your stereo receiver, split screen mode (awesome for watching 2 football games at once) and the numerous inputs available.  Also, the packaging of the TV when I received it was great.  I saw some reviews complaining about the packaging, but I would not worry about that if you are planning on purchasing this TV.Reconsidering, I would give this TV 4 stars instead of 2.","Date":"September 3, 2005"}

Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent.

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet.

Below is part of a review I wrote on the AVS Forum website.  I think it touched on all the shortcomings of the Olevia.Sceptre 30\" vs. Syntax Olevia 30\" the results are in....I see there are a few threads with folks asking and comparing the Sceptre LCD at (...) and the Syntax Olevia LCD. I had the Olevia for a week and I just got the Sceptre yesterday. I think I'm the only one who's had both, so here is my experience that I posted on one of the threads. I hope this will help those wondering which one to buy. If you don't want to read the results, Olevia sucks and the Sceptre is great so far.-------------------------I went looking for a LCD at a good price. It had to have PAL support since I'm going to use it overseas. Found 2 options, Sharp and Olevia. Sharp 22\" was expensive and was only EDTV, so did some research on Olevia. Well there really wasn't any info out there at all. They mostly do motherboards, LCD is a new venture for them.Here is my experience... The spec's on the Olevia were nice on paper, the price was right....Setup was easy, my wife did it while I was at work. My first thought was that the brightness wasn't very good. So I did some adjusting and got it to look alright, but still not thrilled. I hooked up my Toshiba DVD via component input and played a few movies. Traffic, Finding Nemo, Usual Suspects, LOTR, Final Fantasy, COPS, and a few others. Finding Nemo looked the best, and I just credit that with the fantastic job that they did making the movie in the first place. The reds were really overblown everytime, and it was still not the best brightness. The listed contrast ratio is 700:1 when I originally bought it, now I see it's up to 750:1 and I wonder how they came to that conclusion, I figure it's more like 400:1 in reality. Overall color, contrast, and brightness are subpar.The quality of the remote was the dealbreaker for sure. The volume would change when hitting the channel button, the volume would increase when you hit the down volume regularly. When I pressed track forward on my DVD remote it would change the volume too!! When that happen I knew that using my Sony commander remote wouldn't make a difference. The remote on the Olevia is absolute junk, they must have spent $1 on making it. The 2 items that drove me to return it was when switching from DVD (via Y, Pb, Pr) to the TV input the screen went PINK with a couple lines of static (I could hear the TV audio)! The only solution was to turn it off and on. Then I e-mailed Syntax Olevia with my problems to see what they would say, my message got bounced.....I hope this review will help people make a decision whether or not to buy the Olevia (I had the 30\" not that makes a difference compared to the 27\"). I did some more reading and found the Sceptre Naga III ....It has PAL support and Sceptre is an respected LCD monitor manufacturer. Dell offers their monitors on their website and last year Wired magazine rated their 17\" LCD TV as a best buy.....So from my experience with the Olevia and the Sceptre, the Sceptre is a far better LCD. It's not even close IMO, so if I were you I'd scrap plans for the Olevia and buy the Sceptre. And for the record, I'm not just comparing as joe schmo, I'm an engineer and work in non-linear video editing and photography.","Date":"May 23, 2005"}

all LCDs.  We have had no other problems with one exception.  The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level.  At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3.  It cuts out and fritzs.  I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael","Date":"July 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"@2 years: Power failures and screen goes black","Author":"Cara","ReviewID":"R12VDKP2G25KJW","Overall":"bad","Content":"Odds are, if you are looking at reviews for this television, you've got one and you're having problems with it.This happened to me, and after looking on the web, it looks like a number of bugs have been reported:1) The screen flashes blue, then goes black, but you can still hear audio. If you turn the unit off, the blue \"standby\" light still illuminates, but if you turn it on again, the screen is dead, or lights for a while and then goes dead.2) The TV goes dead: no sound, no picture, no standby3) Flickering of colors, etc.In my case, after 30 months of use, I got the first problem, where it would flicker and then go to a black screen, first when using a PS3 via DVI, and later with HDTV cable through the component cables. Needless to say, this was disappointing after paying 1.3k in November 2004. Up until this point, the picture and sound had been reliable and good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.It turns out that the root cause for issue (1) is the Darfon 144 LCD inverter, which generates power to light up the backlight. A number of manufacturers use this part and had the same bug. Based on research at yahoo groups, where there is a list called syntax_lcd, you can fix this by either (a) getting a new inverter board for a couple hundred, (b) removing and re-soldering the transformers to the board to fix bad solders, or (c) replacing a couple specific transistors that are testing poorly.Items 2 and 3 above are driven by a complete or partial failure of the power module. There are also other issues driven by a failure of the motherboard. The yahoo group forum does a good job listing and addressing the problems if you read through a couple hundred comments, you'll find your issue, as well as a few others.The group chats include a number of folks had luck with fixes for all three, and I plan to go down that path in a few weeks. Hopefully it will eke another couple of years of life out of the set, but this might be a good excuse to upgrade to a larger 1080p set.","Date":"June 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"One word...cheap","Author":"J. Rogers","ReviewID":"R3NI8AB6IU40GX","Overall":"bad","Content":"To be honest, I don't have this exact product.  I have it's 'twin', the Syntax Kolin DLT-2711M.  A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word.  At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on.  Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely.  My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death.  A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested.  While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive.  In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for and that includes customer service (however, Syntax's tech support is reportedly more helpful if you actually get through to them).  I think next time I'll buy from a more reputable manufacturer.Caveat emptor.","Date":"January 5, 2008"}

{"Title":"Excellent Value","Author":"Sandy","ReviewID":"R12IJBY6FT9Y2L","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't want to spend alot for a flat panel tv and I didn't want a glorified comptuer monitor either.  So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}

I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"No picture after less than 2 weeks of use!  UPDATE","Author":"Gary A. Bergman","ReviewID":"R3TENMGV1HB3X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I did a lot of research on LCD TV's, and in my research Syntax Groups kept on popping up. It received very good reviews from most electronics magazines, and so with much antipation I ordered the 30\" TV. When I received it I hooked it up to my cable, DVD, and stereo. I immediately had problems. When I tried to route my TV through my stereo system, I found out that by turning my stereo on first, I would loose all power to the TV. The blue light would go out; my remote control would not turn the TV on, nor would the manuel buttons work on the TV. The only way I could turn it on would be to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in. I called Syntax support and he couldn't figure it out either. I tried using a different outlet for my stereo, but to no avail. I purchased a surge protector, by that did not prevent it either. And now, just the other day, the picture went completely black in the middle of a TV program- no blue screen or anything when I turn it on, although the sound works. It is broke after less than 2 weeks! I am really disappointed. I am considering returning the product back to the on-line store where I bought it from. When it was working, I was completely satisfied with the quality of the picture. This is a good product when working, but I wonder if LCD technology is all that reliable. I might revert back to the old CRTV until they get it right. So if you're thinking of buying one, good luck. I hope it is much more reliable than mine was!April 4: This is an update to my previous review dated March 6, 2005. When I discovered that my 30\" Olevia was defective as discribed in my previous review, I decided to call Syntax support to report the problem. They were very curtious and knowledgable and immediately recommeded that I return the TV to them for a new one. Everything was arranged by Syntax. UPS picked up the old one and one week later, right on que, my new one arrived. I immediately hooked it up and it has been running great ever since. At first I had some streaking in fast-action scences, but I retuned the TV with my cable box turned on, and that solved the problem.One week later, my telephone company installed a new digital cable system. This is the latest technology and far superior to the old analog system. Their cable box is a small modem through which comes my telephone; DSL, and cable TV.Some notes of advice: If you have the connections, use the S-Video input on your Syntax to view either cable or Satellite TV. Even though it will not be High Def. it will be much superior to the RF connection. The picture is much brighter and clearer and the flesh tones are great. Also, use your Component connections for your DVD player/recorder. This also is much superior in quality to the RF connection.I am very happy with this TV. I'm glad I made the dicision to return the old one. I would recommend this TV to anyone. I rate this product 4 1/2 stars","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

It turned out that the Yamaha 5760 dosen't handle the video transfer well.  Don't buy this receiver if you want great video and the convienence of switching from DVD to cable or VCR.  When I purchased an onkyo TX-SR702 to transfer the video I could not believe the quality of the picture. I can not believe that any other set could produce a better picture. It takes my breath away!

{"Title":"This thing is going back","Author":"Alfred Penitent","ReviewID":"R1J2N0MMCVD1Y3","Overall":"bad","Content":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was really excited to get this.  After using it for 5 minutes, I knew it was going back.  Reviews of this seem to be either glowing or harsh, without much middle ground.  I think the people who like it are those who care only about picture quality, and don't want to use many of its features.  If you only want a TV monitor for a bright room, the picture and sound are great.  However, there are many bad things about this unit that make it just not worth it.  Where do I begin:Black level & buzz - even with the backlight down low, a full black screen on this will light up your room.  And with the backlight on low, the built-in speakers emit a horrible loud buzz.  It is not a faint hum as I read before buying, it is a LOUD buzz.  I don't understand why LCD makers think we want these things as bright at the sun, I am much more concerned with having black look black.Computer - forget about using this as a monitor.  There is no Windows driver for it.  You can tweak it to look good with a 3rd party tool called PowerStrip, but even then any mode change causes it to slip back into unreadable mode.  And DVI did NOT work with my brand new computer - I had to use a VGA cable.  I heard that if it does work, it will only show a signal after windows starts, so you can't see the boot process or DOS.  The screen is far too bright (or loud) to use for hours at a time without eyestrain.Remote - The remote barely works - you have to press each button 2-5 times to get it to go through, and then it only has a 6 foot range.Interface - The menu system is asinine, with the center button being cancel, and \"right\" being enter.  After much use I still can't get used to it, and it still takes a lot of thought to figure out how to do simple tasks.  Just about everything you do has a 5 second delay as the monitor changes modes.Misc - The headphone jack is in the back behind a screw panel, limited aspect ratios (3), very bad std tv image.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it will be good for people who have no desire to use its features or remote.Even if they fixed half of these problems I wouldn't want this unit.  It just has way too many issues.  The sad thing is they all would be pretty simple issues for the manufacturer to fix.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}

From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet.

For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen.

NY Prof.","ReviewID":"RYT82PISLCZIN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Dear Amazon Shoppers,Beware of ordering this Olevia LT30HV 30\" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV.My experience was 180 degrees different from the November 4, 2004 review from MIMI'm a very big believer in buying through the Internet.  Unfortunately, after reading that review, I did order the Olevia for my Son's birthday.  The TV arrived defective.  The audio worked just fine, but the video would not work.Olevia packages the TV with a sheet directing you to call their toll free number in case there is a problem.  I called the 800 number and described the problem to them. Olevia's tech support advised that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Olevia offered to send me a new motherboard that would be installed by a local technician, BUT advised it would take 3 days from date of shipment to receive, and since it was now Friday, I would have to call back on Monday since all shipments were already picked up.  Compounding the issue was the fact that I couldn't schedule a tech until the motherboard arrived.Olevia suggested that I contact Amazon.  After an hour of searching Amazon's site, I realized that Amazon does not offer an option to call them.  There's no phone number on their site.  You must submit a form, explain the problem in writing, and request resolution.  I submitted the form and didn't hear back for 3 days.Here's the email response I received:==============================Greetings from Amazon.com.I realize that you have experienced a lot of inconvenience.  Isincerely apologize for the inconvenience experienced by you.  I hope you can accept our sincerest apologies for this order.As the item is very sensitive and is to be handled very delicately, this item can only be shipped through Standard shipping.  You would be aware that standard shipping may take around five to six days to reach the item at your door steps.Understanding the criticalities of the time as you require the item for a birthday gift.  If you still need the item we would be happy to make the replacement or else we will refund you in full including the shipping charges.Please write back to us using the link provided at the end of the message as to how would you like us to proceed.Thank you for your understanding in this matter.Please visit the following link to provide the information werequested:Please note: this e-mail was sent from an address that cannot accept incoming e-mail.  Please use the link above to send us your reply.Best regards,Pramod T.Amazon.com Customer Servicehttp://www.amazon.com==============================Given the urgency of the occasion, I went to a local store and purchased a replacement LCD TV for my son's birthday.I responded back to Amazon requesting that they pick up the defective TV.  They advised via return email that the package would be picked up \"usually within a day or two\".To Amazon's credit, they did have the TV picked up the next day.I can't begin to describe the inconvenience.  Imagine the time involved in selecting the TV on Amazon's website.  Ordering, waiting at home for the delivery and the return.  Writing countless letters back and forth (I've not yet received any indication that they've credited my credit card for the returned item), and ultimately replacing the TV with a brand name (Panasonic) at a local merchant.Compare that to my experience purchasing the replacement.  The replacement was purchased from a local merchant.  The local merchant gave me a better price for the name brand merchandise than Amazon was charging for the identical unit.  The merchant delivered the set to my home with same day service (I tipped the salesman $100 to drop it off after work).  My son got his birthday present on his Birthday and it worked right out of the box.Bottom line: DON'T BUY this set from Olevia.Amazon is a great company.  But... I think they should have a toll free number for returns of defective merchandise and respond quicker (to be fair, Amazon's response may have been quicker if it hadn't been so close to the Xmas season)I've had very good experiences with Amazon, but I would NEVER buy anything with a critical time line (birthday, Xmas gifts, etc.) from Amazon again.  Perhaps they should stick with books and DVD's.  I would definitely think twice about ordering electronic equipment from them again.","Date":"December 21, 2004"}

{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}

Thomas","ReviewID":"R2FPBC09W1N2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"If you see this TV going for cheap and your needs are anything like mine, buy it immediately and resist all the techno-junk TV manufacturers are forcing on consumers.First, consider the input into your TV.  If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.  Also gripes on the audio filter, no problem here.  This is a good TV, exceeds my needs, and maybe yours?

{"Title":"Do the RESEARCH the Olevia is tough to beat!!!","Author":"B. Smith","ReviewID":"R2ZJIKK9KUF366","Overall":"good","Content":"I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

{"Title":"Review of 30\" Olevia","Author":"D. Raymond","ReviewID":"R1Z8BRBTO47JLR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recieved this unit today.1. Packaging is absolutely first class.  The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!","Author":"Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"","ReviewID":"R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!  Great set, I'm really pleased.","Date":"January 6, 2005"}

The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

I contacted Syntax their warranty policy covers seven pixels, so I contacted the vendor, the people I ordered through and they said I could send it back for a replacement. Oh wait, you ordered through Amazon, we cannot supply a replacement, you however can send that one back for a refund and then order a new one. Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV. My advise, when you buy this TV, BUY IT THROUGH THE VENDOR, not Amazon.","Date":"October 3, 2004"}

My first unit malfunctioned right out of the box and Amazon immediately shippped me a replacement.  Great customer service!As for the television, it is superb. Packaging is very good and protective. Build quality is excellent. Performance exceeds my expectations.I am using it with Dish Networks hi-def service and the picture quality is astounding.  DVDs are crisp and clear when played from our Sony 6800DP Home Theater in a Box setup.We are also running an iMac Mini with Bluetooth KB and mouse into it via the DVI connection and the set functions perfectly as a monitor. We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.  Very nice!The only weakness is the speakers, which I removed since we are using the Sony setup for surround sound.I highly recommend this set.  For the money, you will be hard-pressed to find a better deal.  [...]","Date":"March 23, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I use it in my room for DVDs, cable TV, and for my iPod's home dock (where I watch the iPod downloads on the TV) and I can't say I've had a better TV for my needs. I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony). I can't speak directly to the HD issue, but you should do your research if that's a deciding factor for you. HD wasn't really a priority for me, but low cost and quality performance were.

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars. A solid purchase with lots of upside and only a a little downside. Don't pay more than this machine for some name brand job - mostly they all use the same components anyway.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best.

Tech support were good and sent a part (new tuner box) with in the week of telling them about this problem.While waiting for the part I noticed that one speaker was not working and contacted tech support again, but this time it has taken 3 weeks for the part to arrive even though they kept telling (after 4 calls to customer support and 2 from them) me it would be here with in the week.Part finally arrives and we organize for a technician to come and replace the broken/dud parts - this is done today May 2 2005  but the speakers don't work. So its back onto customer support.First guy Miguel (one of these people who completely rubs you up the wrong way from the start - and its not the first time I have had the misfortune of speaking with him) - tells me its this and that and we will send another part etc...etc. I told him I wouldn't be happy with that and that the part they have just replaced is defective - I hung up to calm down.Second guy Chris - I tell him exactly the same as the chief muppet above and first thing he said was \"I'll organize customer support to replace the LCD Set with a new one\", simple as that, no ifs or buts,I'll give them a chance with a new set and see how it goes but after that its refund time. I think this set looks good on paper and for the price but from what I've seen written about it on other forums their seems to be to many little problems to make it a really good 5 star product.ProsPrice, Set looks great, excellent cable connection set up choices, no waiting for customer support to answer the phone.ConsPicture quality isn't the best (to much red), sound is a bit tinny and not enough bass, some at customer support need a good slap for being rude.","Date":"May 2, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good but not great.","Author":"L. Fang \"WiFi  Installer\"","ReviewID":"R3HBNOVJSOSHM4","Overall":"good","Content":"Owned for 2 months now and for the price I cannot complain too much. Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed. I can aim the remote at the wall opposite the TV and the remote still works.","Date":"February 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best 27' HDTV-ready  LCD monitor in it's price range..........","Author":"micritt \"mic\"","ReviewID":"R34RA8GJSP5I2A","Overall":"good","Content":"That's because it's the ONLY  LCD-TV in this range that's available. I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

The stand is already built-in, and only needed to hook up the cables.  Factory settings are pretty off target.  After some minor tweaking, this thing was blowing my mind!  I knew the images would be better than on regular tube TV's, but I was not prepared for the magnitude of improvement.  The \"Two Towers\" extended DVD played beatufully on this TV.  I did not imagine how much detail I had missed at the theater!.Today, I hooked up the laptop with the included VGA cable and was able to read an electronic newspaper on this thing from my couch.  Had to set the screen to 4:3 for best rendering.  I'll set up a screensaver of my best family pictures tomorrow.  I can't wait to explore all the features of this great piece of electronic wonder.

{"Title":"Best value in LCD TVs","Author":"L. Prokopets","ReviewID":"RSTPMUT74LLHK","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched LCD TVs carefully before buying the Syntax Olevia LT30HV.  There's not much info out there on this set.  Fortunately, I was swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon.  This TV has a great picture, looks nice, can be used with or without its side speakers, and is one of the cheapest on the market.  HDTV and DVDs look absolutely fantastic.  Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).  I recommend this TV highly and will definitely consider Syntax when I am ready to upgrade.","Date":"December 24, 2004"}
{"Title":"Best value you can get.","Author":"Nathan Balko \"lets go!\"","ReviewID":"R1WVFI1FZ5XMMP","Overall":"good","Content":"I was an early adopter of this TV.  I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

{"Title":"The LT30HV 30\": Nice picture, but some technical problems and annoying features","Author":"Brandon W.","ReviewID":"R3AL3QWUV4P3AM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV because of the reasonable price and mostly positive reviews.  I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}

There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

Banks","ReviewID":"RL2K8XXMWXA3S","Overall":"good","Content":"I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable.  But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

A toaster I recently bought was packed more securely, and I'd imagine that a toaster is a little less fragile than an LCD TV.Once hooked up and turned on my heart sank.

(Its nice that Amazon does this.)TV #2 didn't fare much better.  There was that lack of packing material again.  When I turned it on it was even worse.  A bright, neon green pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Both TV's were nothing but static on channel 11, too!Amazon was great about taking both back without shipping charges.  It's a shame about the TV, though, I really liked the overall design.  But dead pixels and static have turned me away from this brand.Hopefully this was just a bad batch.

Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $200. But why invest that amount, when you can add another $200, and purchase a new and better TV.I'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand. I guess that's why you see so many of them for sale online. And their either refurbished or open box. I'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability.Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Samsung or RCA product.

Everything works as expected. Picture quality is good but not excellent andis reasonable for its price.I seemed to have a really poor IR receiver module in the LCD.

And, my old NEC TV, though farther and almost at 90 degree angle from the remote, kept turning on and off while the syntax LCD was ignoring the keys. I called Syntax Tech support, and he told me that the IR module is probably defective. They will send a new one to me and send some technician over to replace it. Hopefully it will work fine after that. Will follow up with this post.To Tak Leung, who had previous post about the TV turning itselfoff after an hour or so, while browsing the setups, I saw sleep control where the TV would turn it self OFF after the timer expires.

I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}
{"Title":"Still Going Strong","Author":"Bill Stockstill \"\"Bill\"\"","ReviewID":"R11XXN5AHM4EZY","Overall":"good","Content":"Our Olevia is 6 years old, in use everyday and still has a great picture. When we purchased it, it was half the price of the Samsungs and Sonys of the same size and the picture looked better! Its a 720p and the eye can't tell the difference of 1080p until you get to 37\". It doesn't have as many inputs as today's TVs do, it only has a DVI input, not an HDMI and 2 component inputs (one HD and one 480p) as well as a cable input. I've used a PS3 with it as well as a Dish HD receiver. When we had cable, I used a splitter and connected one input to the HD component inputs and another to the cable and thus enabled its picture-in-a-picture function. The picture is vivid and sharp. If you can find one of these gems, I recommend buying it for a small room or bedroom.","Date":"February 18, 2010"}
{"Title":"2-year Life Expectancy","Author":"R. DELUNA","ReviewID":"RZTM4OO83PV9Q","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this around December 2004.  Initially I was happy about it because pricing was good for that time and it had several good reviews.  Performance was very good in the beginning.  After a few months, a problem started, everytime you are watching a bright scene (i.e. an explosion, a really white/bright scene like snow) the screen would turn to blue (like a computer).  It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.  It progressively got worse until turning it off and on didn't work anymore.  Around early 2007 we gave it up for dead.","Date":"September 5, 2007"}

Blacks are a little off, but not bad.Sound is terrible.  Throw out speakers as soon as you get this TV, they are worthless.  I think that is the reason they made them detachable.  If you try and hook up an satalite speakers threw the audio, they will not work.  An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.  For almost as much as the TV, you can get DirecTVs HD equipment - but that will only make HD shows look better.  All the other channels will still look like a blown up JPEG.","Date":"August 8, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good TV - Monitor","Author":"ama2001","ReviewID":"RXWL54LTUNGAS","Overall":"good","Content":"I received my Olevia 30\" TV approx. 2 weeks ago.  It is in the bedroom, and used as both a TV and as a computer monitor.The TV performance is very good.  Hooked up to cable (RCN).  Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  View TV from 13feet - picture size comfortable.  Also, the remote works fine from 13feet away. [remote model RC-LTS]As a computer monitor - PERFECT.  Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  I can comfortably sit at the desk with the TV approx. 24inches from my face and work at the computer.  NO MORE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING!!!  Also, to do picture adjustment (menu - picture - auto adjustment - press volume up key) ---> use remote.Did try to use the DVI cable (from a previous monitor) - but only worked sometimes.  Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.  I think it is well worth the cost.[...]","Date":"April 2, 2005"}
{"Title":"Standard Cable Stations Do Not Come In","Author":"Chris","ReviewID":"R1GM3ID81NNYA0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Don't buy this TV if you plan on watching channels that aren't HDTV.  I bought a LT30HV and I must say that the HDTV channels look outstanding as do DVDs and video games.  However, the reception on normal cable channels is horrible.  This is not to say that it is only bad compared to other HDTVs, but it looks much worse than any reception I have ever seen.  It looks like a very bad UHF signal from pre-cable days because everything is very blurry and it looks like its snowing on every analog channel.  Its basically unwatchable.  The digital channels are slightly more tolerable.  But I have a 5 year old $100 piece of crap 20\" sharp TV that gets crystal clear reception from the same cable box and connection.  I have talked to Syntax about this and they assured me that it was the signal coming into the TV.  Since then I have changed cable boxes, used different wires, tried different inputs, had the cable company install a signal amplifier, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem.  My cable provider (Comcast) offers mostly analog channels for the most popular stations, digital channels for the higher number cable channels and a few HDTV channels.  If your cable provider is the same way, I would STRONGLY advise against buying this unit.  Other than the fact that you can't watch about 75% of the channels from my cable box, the only other complaint I would have is that the remote is very poorly designed.  Also, now that it has taken me a little over a month to figure out that it is absolutely the TV that is causing this, I don't have the opportunity to return it anymore.  So I paid $1000 for this unit to watch a few HD channels... what a ripoff.EDIT:After having this TV for a while, I think my criticism was much too harsh.  Its still true that some analog channels don't come in and the remote is absurd, but I am happy with everything else about the TV.  For some reason about half the analog stations come in fine and half are somewhat fuzzy, though I have noticed similar things with other HDTVs.  The picture on the digital channels actually is fine, I think its a bit underwhelming due more to the signal coming through my cable box.  The picture on the HDTV channels is spectacular.  Maybe other high end TVs reportedly have better colors or whatever but I'm telling you that watching football, baseball, basketball, nature shows, etc is mesmerizing.  Some other nice features that I have discovered are the removable speakers that can be wired directly to your stereo receiver, split screen mode (awesome for watching 2 football games at once) and the numerous inputs available.  Also, the packaging of the TV when I received it was great.  I saw some reviews complaining about the packaging, but I would not worry about that if you are planning on purchasing this TV.Reconsidering, I would give this TV 4 stars instead of 2.","Date":"September 3, 2005"}

Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent.

{"Title":"Olevia Review","Author":"Thy","ReviewID":"R20FRSL3A0TJZW","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. <br /><br />But if you want to find out some more, or see more pictures. Go check out my profile at [...] . My username is virebelrus .

Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor.  Great for xbox using progressive component.  For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video.  Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt.  Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720).  As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back.  I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal.

{"Title":"Initial offering of this TV was horrible - has it changed?","Author":"Wreckinball","ReviewID":"RTRJYC0X1UPYO","Overall":"bad","Content":"Back in April of last year I went looking for a LCD and first tried out the Olevia which was returned immediately, I then bought the Sceptre LCD which has been fantastic.  Below is part of a review I wrote on the AVS Forum website.  I think it touched on all the shortcomings of the Olevia.Sceptre 30\" vs. Syntax Olevia 30\" the results are in....I see there are a few threads with folks asking and comparing the Sceptre LCD at (...) and the Syntax Olevia LCD. I had the Olevia for a week and I just got the Sceptre yesterday. I think I'm the only one who's had both, so here is my experience that I posted on one of the threads. I hope this will help those wondering which one to buy. If you don't want to read the results, Olevia sucks and the Sceptre is great so far.-------------------------I went looking for a LCD at a good price. It had to have PAL support since I'm going to use it overseas. Found 2 options, Sharp and Olevia. Sharp 22\" was expensive and was only EDTV, so did some research on Olevia. Well there really wasn't any info out there at all. They mostly do motherboards, LCD is a new venture for them.Here is my experience... The spec's on the Olevia were nice on paper, the price was right....Setup was easy, my wife did it while I was at work. My first thought was that the brightness wasn't very good. So I did some adjusting and got it to look alright, but still not thrilled. I hooked up my Toshiba DVD via component input and played a few movies. Traffic, Finding Nemo, Usual Suspects, LOTR, Final Fantasy, COPS, and a few others. Finding Nemo looked the best, and I just credit that with the fantastic job that they did making the movie in the first place. The reds were really overblown everytime, and it was still not the best brightness. The listed contrast ratio is 700:1 when I originally bought it, now I see it's up to 750:1 and I wonder how they came to that conclusion, I figure it's more like 400:1 in reality. Overall color, contrast, and brightness are subpar.The quality of the remote was the dealbreaker for sure. The volume would change when hitting the channel button, the volume would increase when you hit the down volume regularly. When I pressed track forward on my DVD remote it would change the volume too!! When that happen I knew that using my Sony commander remote wouldn't make a difference. The remote on the Olevia is absolute junk, they must have spent $1 on making it. The 2 items that drove me to return it was when switching from DVD (via Y, Pb, Pr) to the TV input the screen went PINK with a couple lines of static (I could hear the TV audio)! The only solution was to turn it off and on. Then I e-mailed Syntax Olevia with my problems to see what they would say, my message got bounced.....I hope this review will help people make a decision whether or not to buy the Olevia (I had the 30\" not that makes a difference compared to the 27\"). I did some more reading and found the Sceptre Naga III ....It has PAL support and Sceptre is an respected LCD monitor manufacturer. Dell offers their monitors on their website and last year Wired magazine rated their 17\" LCD TV as a best buy.....So from my experience with the Olevia and the Sceptre, the Sceptre is a far better LCD. It's not even close IMO, so if I were you I'd scrap plans for the Olevia and buy the Sceptre. And for the record, I'm not just comparing as joe schmo, I'm an engineer and work in non-linear video editing and photography.","Date":"May 23, 2005"}

all LCDs.  We have had no other problems with one exception.  The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level.  At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3.  It cuts out and fritzs.  I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael","Date":"July 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"@2 years: Power failures and screen goes black","Author":"Cara","ReviewID":"R12VDKP2G25KJW","Overall":"bad","Content":"Odds are, if you are looking at reviews for this television, you've got one and you're having problems with it.This happened to me, and after looking on the web, it looks like a number of bugs have been reported:1) The screen flashes blue, then goes black, but you can still hear audio. If you turn the unit off, the blue \"standby\" light still illuminates, but if you turn it on again, the screen is dead, or lights for a while and then goes dead.2) The TV goes dead: no sound, no picture, no standby3) Flickering of colors, etc.In my case, after 30 months of use, I got the first problem, where it would flicker and then go to a black screen, first when using a PS3 via DVI, and later with HDTV cable through the component cables. Needless to say, this was disappointing after paying 1.3k in November 2004. Up until this point, the picture and sound had been reliable and good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.It turns out that the root cause for issue (1) is the Darfon 144 LCD inverter, which generates power to light up the backlight. A number of manufacturers use this part and had the same bug. Based on research at yahoo groups, where there is a list called syntax_lcd, you can fix this by either (a) getting a new inverter board for a couple hundred, (b) removing and re-soldering the transformers to the board to fix bad solders, or (c) replacing a couple specific transistors that are testing poorly.Items 2 and 3 above are driven by a complete or partial failure of the power module. There are also other issues driven by a failure of the motherboard. The yahoo group forum does a good job listing and addressing the problems if you read through a couple hundred comments, you'll find your issue, as well as a few others.The group chats include a number of folks had luck with fixes for all three, and I plan to go down that path in a few weeks. Hopefully it will eke another couple of years of life out of the set, but this might be a good excuse to upgrade to a larger 1080p set.","Date":"June 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"One word...cheap","Author":"J. Rogers","ReviewID":"R3NI8AB6IU40GX","Overall":"bad","Content":"To be honest, I don't have this exact product.  I have it's 'twin', the Syntax Kolin DLT-2711M.  A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word.  At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on.  Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely.  My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death.  A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested.  While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive.  In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for and that includes customer service (however, Syntax's tech support is reportedly more helpful if you actually get through to them).  I think next time I'll buy from a more reputable manufacturer.Caveat emptor.","Date":"January 5, 2008"}

So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"The Bargain of the Year!","Author":"Couch Tater","ReviewID":"R11HT4BVX95D49","Overall":"good","Content":"My 30\" Olevia LCD TV was delivered two days ago.  I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"No picture after less than 2 weeks of use!  UPDATE","Author":"Gary A. Bergman","ReviewID":"R3TENMGV1HB3X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I did a lot of research on LCD TV's, and in my research Syntax Groups kept on popping up. It received very good reviews from most electronics magazines, and so with much antipation I ordered the 30\" TV. When I received it I hooked it up to my cable, DVD, and stereo. I immediately had problems. When I tried to route my TV through my stereo system, I found out that by turning my stereo on first, I would loose all power to the TV. The blue light would go out; my remote control would not turn the TV on, nor would the manuel buttons work on the TV. The only way I could turn it on would be to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in. I called Syntax support and he couldn't figure it out either. I tried using a different outlet for my stereo, but to no avail. I purchased a surge protector, by that did not prevent it either. And now, just the other day, the picture went completely black in the middle of a TV program- no blue screen or anything when I turn it on, although the sound works. It is broke after less than 2 weeks! I am really disappointed. I am considering returning the product back to the on-line store where I bought it from. When it was working, I was completely satisfied with the quality of the picture. This is a good product when working, but I wonder if LCD technology is all that reliable. I might revert back to the old CRTV until they get it right. So if you're thinking of buying one, good luck. I hope it is much more reliable than mine was!April 4: This is an update to my previous review dated March 6, 2005. When I discovered that my 30\" Olevia was defective as discribed in my previous review, I decided to call Syntax support to report the problem. They were very curtious and knowledgable and immediately recommeded that I return the TV to them for a new one. Everything was arranged by Syntax. UPS picked up the old one and one week later, right on que, my new one arrived. I immediately hooked it up and it has been running great ever since. At first I had some streaking in fast-action scences, but I retuned the TV with my cable box turned on, and that solved the problem.One week later, my telephone company installed a new digital cable system. This is the latest technology and far superior to the old analog system. Their cable box is a small modem through which comes my telephone; DSL, and cable TV.Some notes of advice: If you have the connections, use the S-Video input on your Syntax to view either cable or Satellite TV. Even though it will not be High Def. it will be much superior to the RF connection. The picture is much brighter and clearer and the flesh tones are great. Also, use your Component connections for your DVD player/recorder. This also is much superior in quality to the RF connection.I am very happy with this TV. I'm glad I made the dicision to return the old one. I would recommend this TV to anyone. I rate this product 4 1/2 stars","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

After using it for 5 minutes, I knew it was going back.  Reviews of this seem to be either glowing or harsh, without much middle ground.  I think the people who like it are those who care only about picture quality, and don't want to use many of its features.  If you only want a TV monitor for a bright room, the picture and sound are great.  However, there are many bad things about this unit that make it just not worth it.  Where do I begin:Black level & buzz - even with the backlight down low, a full black screen on this will light up your room.  And with the backlight on low, the built-in speakers emit a horrible loud buzz.  It is not a faint hum as I read before buying, it is a LOUD buzz.  I don't understand why LCD makers think we want these things as bright at the sun, I am much more concerned with having black look black.Computer - forget about using this as a monitor.  There is no Windows driver for it.  You can tweak it to look good with a 3rd party tool called PowerStrip, but even then any mode change causes it to slip back into unreadable mode.  And DVI did NOT work with my brand new computer - I had to use a VGA cable.  I heard that if it does work, it will only show a signal after windows starts, so you can't see the boot process or DOS.  The screen is far too bright (or loud) to use for hours at a time without eyestrain.Remote - The remote barely works - you have to press each button 2-5 times to get it to go through, and then it only has a 6 foot range.Interface - The menu system is asinine, with the center button being cancel, and \"right\" being enter.  After much use I still can't get used to it, and it still takes a lot of thought to figure out how to do simple tasks.  Just about everything you do has a 5 second delay as the monitor changes modes.Misc - The headphone jack is in the back behind a screw panel, limited aspect ratios (3), very bad std tv image.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it will be good for people who have no desire to use its features or remote.Even if they fixed half of these problems I wouldn't want this unit.  It just has way too many issues.  The sad thing is they all would be pretty simple issues for the manufacturer to fix.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}

{"Title":"Sounds like a crapshoot  LT27HV","Author":"Tom Urbanik \"2jaded2care\"","ReviewID":"R31MPVQ4JEEF4B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have taken the time to read almost 100 of these reviews good and bad, and some people get the lemons, some don't, and some may not even know they got a lemon.Although I did not get my Syntax LCD tv from Amazon, I have purchased other things like pots and pans.  From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia Review","Author":"Thy","ReviewID":"R1JWDD8RLIW3U8","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. &#60;br /&#62;<br />","Date":"December 10, 2004"}

{"Title":"Over Priced TV","Author":"DKFC","ReviewID":"RY0OP58GYGH8G","Overall":"bad","Content":"I use this display in my line of work. The quality is generally above average if not that great. The color is not as bright or vivid but the ability to receive and play HD programs does let one peek into the future of digital programmings and that itself is an enjoyable experience.The LT30HV has considerable weakness in the DVI mode, often the display will exhibit no picture or incorrect color scheme, 6 months to a year after opening the box. For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen. This slight discoloration can take the fun out of having the LCD TV.For the price advertised here, it is definately not worth it.","Date":"March 21, 2006"}

For the price, I was not too concerned about all the technical details but when I finally got it home and played around with it: I knew that it wouldn't be in my house for long.PROBLEMS:1. Adjusting for proper brightness/sharpness/hue/contrast is all over the place. Just when you think you've got it tweaked to a reasonable picture - change to a different channel and you have to start all over again. I'm sorry but I'm not going to adjust all those options every time the channel changes.2. No sleep timer??? Whoever decided to omit this very basic feature was definitely asleep at the drawing board. I've got $50 TV's that have a sleep time on it.3. Sound was pretty weak on it too but the least of my problems.I cannot believe that people are raving about this TV. I understand the 27\" and 30\" are better than the cost-saving measures they applied to the 20\".Even though it was a cheap TV (almost disposable at that price).

{"Title":"*****Beware - QC Issues with Olevia*****","Author":"L.I. NY Prof.","ReviewID":"RYT82PISLCZIN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Dear Amazon Shoppers,Beware of ordering this Olevia LT30HV 30\" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV.My experience was 180 degrees different from the November 4, 2004 review from MIMI'm a very big believer in buying through the Internet.  Unfortunately, after reading that review, I did order the Olevia for my Son's birthday.  The TV arrived defective.  The audio worked just fine, but the video would not work.Olevia packages the TV with a sheet directing you to call their toll free number in case there is a problem.  I called the 800 number and described the problem to them. Olevia's tech support advised that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Olevia offered to send me a new motherboard that would be installed by a local technician, BUT advised it would take 3 days from date of shipment to receive, and since it was now Friday, I would have to call back on Monday since all shipments were already picked up.  Compounding the issue was the fact that I couldn't schedule a tech until the motherboard arrived.Olevia suggested that I contact Amazon.  After an hour of searching Amazon's site, I realized that Amazon does not offer an option to call them.  There's no phone number on their site.  You must submit a form, explain the problem in writing, and request resolution.  I submitted the form and didn't hear back for 3 days.Here's the email response I received:==============================Greetings from Amazon.com.I realize that you have experienced a lot of inconvenience.  Isincerely apologize for the inconvenience experienced by you.  I hope you can accept our sincerest apologies for this order.As the item is very sensitive and is to be handled very delicately, this item can only be shipped through Standard shipping.  You would be aware that standard shipping may take around five to six days to reach the item at your door steps.Understanding the criticalities of the time as you require the item for a birthday gift.  If you still need the item we would be happy to make the replacement or else we will refund you in full including the shipping charges.Please write back to us using the link provided at the end of the message as to how would you like us to proceed.Thank you for your understanding in this matter.Please visit the following link to provide the information werequested:Please note: this e-mail was sent from an address that cannot accept incoming e-mail.  Please use the link above to send us your reply.Best regards,Pramod T.Amazon.com Customer Servicehttp://www.amazon.com==============================Given the urgency of the occasion, I went to a local store and purchased a replacement LCD TV for my son's birthday.I responded back to Amazon requesting that they pick up the defective TV.  They advised via return email that the package would be picked up \"usually within a day or two\".To Amazon's credit, they did have the TV picked up the next day.I can't begin to describe the inconvenience.  Imagine the time involved in selecting the TV on Amazon's website.  Ordering, waiting at home for the delivery and the return.  Writing countless letters back and forth (I've not yet received any indication that they've credited my credit card for the returned item), and ultimately replacing the TV with a brand name (Panasonic) at a local merchant.Compare that to my experience purchasing the replacement.  The replacement was purchased from a local merchant.  The local merchant gave me a better price for the name brand merchandise than Amazon was charging for the identical unit.  The merchant delivered the set to my home with same day service (I tipped the salesman $100 to drop it off after work).  My son got his birthday present on his Birthday and it worked right out of the box.Bottom line: DON'T BUY this set from Olevia.Amazon is a great company.  But... I think they should have a toll free number for returns of defective merchandise and respond quicker (to be fair, Amazon's response may have been quicker if it hadn't been so close to the Xmas season)I've had very good experiences with Amazon, but I would NEVER buy anything with a critical time line (birthday, Xmas gifts, etc.) from Amazon again.  Perhaps they should stick with books and DVD's.  I would definitely think twice about ordering electronic equipment from them again.","Date":"December 21, 2004"}

{"Title":"Not only inexpensive, but excellent image quality","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"R27PZ81V3A7TX1","Overall":"good","Content":"Syntax Group is an Asian company that has recently entered the LCD market here stateside.  Its first offerings of LCD TVs are already getting positive reviews from users.  ExtremeTech (a PC Mag offshoot) recently reviewed the 30-inch LCD TV and gave it an 8 out of 10.  I also found other positive independent online reviews, so I decided to give this new brand a try, and got the 27-inch model after landing a new job.Wow!  I was very impressed with the image quality of this LCD TV.  I had seen \"low-cost\" LCD TVs from Westinghouse (at Best Buy) and Gateway (at one of the now-defunct Gateway Country stores), and they were disappointing in contrast and image quality.  The Syntax Olevia, despite its silly name, is definitely the best I've seen for this price class.  Of course, if you take a Sharp Aquos or a Panasonic LCD TV side-by-side with the Olevia, the Sharp and Panasonic will be much better, giving you a more vibrant image, but they also cost almost twice as much as the Olevia!  If you are absolutely into the best LCD quality, you have to get a Sharp; they are just the best.  But if you want value but don't want to sacrifice too much in quality, this is probably the best balance.The Olevia is also generous in terms of video inputs.  You also get DVI, something a lot of LCD TVs omit.  The VGA port means you can use this as a computer monitor, but I haven't tried that yet.  The native scan supports 720p and the internal scaler allows you to view 1080i programs as well.  Hooked up to a progress-scan DVD player, the Olevia makes movies a joy to watch.In summary, the Olevia is a great entry-level LCD TV.  If 27\" is a bit too small for you, go for the 30\" model which costs just $400 more.  Syntax is also coming out with bigger screens later this year.","Date":"October 7, 2004"}
{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}
{"Title":"Not only inexpensive, but excellent image quality","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"R2GQSLTW5JQ3ZB","Overall":"good","Content":"(I reviewed this model's little sibling, the 27\" model, but both use the same video engine and are identical in feature and quality.  I hope my review can help you somewhat.)Syntax Group is an Asian company that has recently entered the LCD market here stateside.  Its first offerings of LCD TVs are already getting positive reviews from users.  ExtremeTech (a PC Mag offshoot) recently reviewed the 30-inch LCD TV and gave it an 8 out of 10.  I also found other positive independent online reviews, so I decided to give this new brand a try, and got the 27-inch model after landing a new job.Wow!  I was very impressed with the image quality of this LCD TV.  I had seen \"low-cost\" LCD TVs from Westinghouse (at Best Buy) and Gateway (at one of the now-defunct Gateway Country stores), and they were disappointing in contrast and image quality.  The Syntax Olevia, despite its silly name, is definitely the best I've seen for this price class.  Of course, if you take a Sharp Aquos or a Panasonic LCD TV side-by-side with the Olevia, the Sharp and Panasonic will be much better, giving you a more vibrant image, but they also cost almost twice as much as the Olevia!  If you are absolutely into the best LCD quality, you have to get a Sharp; they are just the best.  But if you want value but don't want to sacrifice too much in quality, this is probably the best balance.The Olevia is also generous in terms of video inputs.  You also get DVI, something a lot of LCD TVs omit.  The VGA port means you can use this as a computer monitor, but I haven't tried that yet.  The native scan supports 720p and the internal scaler allows you to view 1080i programs as well.  Hooked up to a progress-scan DVD player, the Olevia makes movies a joy to watch.In summary, the Olevia is a great entry-level LCD TV.  If 27\" is a bit too small for you, go for the 30\" model which costs just $400 more.  Syntax is also coming out with bigger screens later this year.","Date":"October 7, 2004"}

For the space in my house, I needed a TV less than 40 inches so was fairly limited b/w smaller Plasmas and larger LCD's.I looked at the Sharp, but was willing to go with the Olevia due to the # of favorable user reviews I found.  There are a couple of 'expert reviews' that don't recommend Olevia (Cnet), but there were some very favorable recommendations (extremetech [...] gave it an 8/10)I received the TV in fine shape - excellent packing.  I was shocked to have it up and running within 5 minutes and looking great - I expected it would take much longer.  I had Comcast upgrade to the HD service and Hi-def looks awesome on the TV.

Lowering the resolution to 1280x720 is no big deal, because I get to maximize all my video details settings to \"very high\" and those buffering to 'tripple'.","Date":"October 19, 2004"}
{"Title":"Olevia LT20HVK 20\" Flat Panel LCD TV - Reviewed","Author":"W. Thomas","ReviewID":"R2FPBC09W1N2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"If you see this TV going for cheap and your needs are anything like mine, buy it immediately and resist all the techno-junk TV manufacturers are forcing on consumers.First, consider the input into your TV.  If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.  Also gripes on the audio filter, no problem here.  This is a good TV, exceeds my needs, and maybe yours?  Please research my rantings, judge for yourself, and don't get fooled into buying more than you need.  Cheers!","Date":"February 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"Do the RESEARCH the Olevia is tough to beat!!!","Author":"TR650","ReviewID":"R2ZJIKK9KUF366","Overall":"good","Content":"I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

{"Title":"Review of 30\" Olevia","Author":"D. Raymond","ReviewID":"R1Z8BRBTO47JLR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recieved this unit today.1. Packaging is absolutely first class.  The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!","Author":"Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"","ReviewID":"R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!

The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I haven't experienced any problems that were mentioned previously in the reviews and I'm very satisfied.  I use it in my room for DVDs, cable TV, and for my iPod's home dock (where I watch the iPod downloads on the TV) and I can't say I've had a better TV for my needs. I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony). I can't speak directly to the HD issue, but you should do your research if that's a deciding factor for you. HD wasn't really a priority for me, but low cost and quality performance were. I feel that my needs are met with this TV.","Date":"August 19, 2006"}

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

I received it in early October, 2005 & everything was fine - at first.  About 10 months later, the set started going black after it was first turned on & I had to turn it off & then on again.  Over the course of the next couple of months, this problem got progressively worse.  Now, I sometimes have to turn it off & on 10 to 20 times before it will stay on.  So, I have had two sets -- neither of which worked a full year.  Also, I found out that the second set that was sent to me was a refurbished set.

Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars. A solid purchase with lots of upside and only a a little downside. Don't pay more than this machine for some name brand job - mostly they all use the same components anyway.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

No it does not quite have the picture of a $4000 or $5000 plasma or more-expensive projection LCD, but, it is simple to set up, has all of the appropriate connections (except an optical audio-out - bummer), and, plays DVD and HDTV beautifully.  For the small picture quality sacrifice (compared to units twice and three times its price), Syntax puts this TV within the financial reach of working-class folks.

The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best.

Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed.

No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color.

Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

I had been considering the LCD option, but wanted value for my bucks.  After much research, and reading lots of reviews, I decided it was time.Brought the box home and immediately it was up an running.  The stand is already built-in, and only needed to hook up the cables.  Factory settings are pretty off target.  After some minor tweaking, this thing was blowing my mind!  I knew the images would be better than on regular tube TV's, but I was not prepared for the magnitude of improvement.  The \"Two Towers\" extended DVD played beatufully on this TV.  I did not imagine how much detail I had missed at the theater!.Today, I hooked up the laptop with the included VGA cable and was able to read an electronic newspaper on this thing from my couch.  Had to set the screen to 4:3 for best rendering.  I'll set up a screensaver of my best family pictures tomorrow.  I can't wait to explore all the features of this great piece of electronic wonder.  So far, I'm ready to throw out the box.  This one's a keeper!.","Date":"March 8, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best value in LCD TVs","Author":"L. Prokopets","ReviewID":"RSTPMUT74LLHK","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched LCD TVs carefully before buying the Syntax Olevia LT30HV.  There's not much info out there on this set.  Fortunately, I was swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon.  This TV has a great picture, looks nice, can be used with or without its side speakers, and is one of the cheapest on the market.  HDTV and DVDs look absolutely fantastic.  Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).  I recommend this TV highly and will definitely consider Syntax when I am ready to upgrade.","Date":"December 24, 2004"}

I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

Last week CompUsa ran a deal for $699 and I jsut ran over and purchased it.  I am a big fan of Amazon, but this deal was too good, and financed for 21 month no interest!  For little over $33 per month for the next 21 months, how can I go wrong!  Even if the tv stinks, this is one hell of a computer monitor for the money!I think most of the reviews said most of what needs to be said.  The high def picture is just stunning!  Its hard to compare to the sony as the store images are so bad given the split signals, but the blacks were blacker on the sony.  At $699 I could have bought 3 of these vs. just one 23inch sony!  The DVI input off my Bravo D1 was just incredible.Synatax just released a new 26' lcd for list of $899 with some improvements.  The specs on the Syntax line are incredible for the money, and the 27 set I have has impressed me with its build quality.  I have the new remote, and while its not the best, I really don't mind it at all.  I will be using the cable box one until I get a universal one figured out.In conclusion, if this thing proves durable I will be very happy.  The Warranty does not include the lcd itself so read up on it and consider a suppliment.  At $149 I did spring for the compusa one, although I hate them!  It is very liberal.

From what I found, there is no other product out there of this quality and image level at this price point.  Hats off to Syntax for a great product.  The unit performs as good or better than expected based on other reviews I have read.  Many bad comments on the remote,  but mine works fine from just about any distance, but is a little sensitive to angle.  FYI  If you have a universal remote, you may not find Syntax codes in the manual, so try the various RCA codes available... one of these should probably work... it did with my SA Cable Set Top Universal Remote.I have not seen the TV operate with and HD input yet.  Still anxiously waiting for my cable company to come out and hook me up. The quality on standard Digital Cable is still outstanding, exceeding my expectations, even on an S-video input.  I plan to use the DVI-D interface for HD Cable ..... can't wait!  DVD's are awesome when using Component inputs (Y Pb Pr).

{"Title":"The LT30HV 30\": Nice picture, but some technical problems and annoying features","Author":"Brandon W.","ReviewID":"R3AL3QWUV4P3AM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV because of the reasonable price and mostly positive reviews.  I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"FAQ's missing.  Hopefully this will help","Author":"M. CLARK \"mc\"","ReviewID":"R1AFD57LAFBQK9","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw there were problems with the aspect ratio. 3 reviews below me says that the picture looks stretched. There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.

I sure don't miss my old CRT TV . . .I agree with the criticism that the volume is too high at the minimum setting - but it isn't a major annoyance.

No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

A toaster I recently bought was packed more securely, and I'd imagine that a toaster is a little less fragile than an LCD TV.Once hooked up and turned on my heart sank.  Right there in the middle of the screen is a pixel stuck on bright red.  I went to Amazon's return section, and arranged an exchange, with the new one comming before I sent the old one back.  (Its nice that Amazon does this.)TV #2 didn't fare much better.  There was that lack of packing material again.  When I turned it on it was even worse.  A bright, neon green pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Both TV's were nothing but static on channel 11, too!Amazon was great about taking both back without shipping charges.  It's a shame about the TV, though, I really liked the overall design.  But dead pixels and static have turned me away from this brand.Hopefully this was just a bad batch.

Of course you can purchase a new board online for about $200. But why invest that amount, when you can add another $200, and purchase a new and better TV.I'm really disappointed with the Olevia brand. I guess that's why you see so many of them for sale online. And their either refurbished or open box. I'm sure a lot of customers are returning Olevias due to their unreliability.Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic, Sharp, Sony, Samsung or RCA product.

Everything works as expected. Picture quality is good but not excellent andis reasonable for its price.I seemed to have a really poor IR receiver module in the LCD. The remote has to be within 5' and straight in from of the sensor; otherwise, it just won't work. It is funny that my old NEC TV has a few remote keys that maps to this Syntax remote control. And, my old NEC TV, though farther and almost at 90 degree angle from the remote, kept turning on and off while the syntax LCD was ignoring the keys. I called Syntax Tech support, and he told me that the IR module is probably defective. They will send a new one to me and send some technician over to replace it. Hopefully it will work fine after that. Will follow up with this post.To Tak Leung, who had previous post about the TV turning itselfoff after an hour or so, while browsing the setups, I saw sleep control where the TV would turn it self OFF after the timer expires.

{"Title":"Great value with great picture","Author":"Frontrunner","ReviewID":"R2R4J4LG08Y0QL","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this LCD TV a couple of months ago on sale and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

After a few months, a problem started, everytime you are watching a bright scene (i.e. an explosion, a really white/bright scene like snow) the screen would turn to blue (like a computer).  It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.

Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  I can comfortably sit at the desk with the TV approx. 24inches from my face and work at the computer.  NO MORE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING!!!  Also, to do picture adjustment (menu - picture - auto adjustment - press volume up key) ---> use remote.Did try to use the DVI cable (from a previous monitor) - but only worked sometimes.  Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.  I think it is well worth the cost.[...]","Date":"April 2, 2005"}
{"Title":"Standard Cable Stations Do Not Come In","Author":"Chris","ReviewID":"R1GM3ID81NNYA0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Don't buy this TV if you plan on watching channels that aren't HDTV.  I bought a LT30HV and I must say that the HDTV channels look outstanding as do DVDs and video games.  However, the reception on normal cable channels is horrible.  This is not to say that it is only bad compared to other HDTVs, but it looks much worse than any reception I have ever seen.  It looks like a very bad UHF signal from pre-cable days because everything is very blurry and it looks like its snowing on every analog channel.  Its basically unwatchable.  The digital channels are slightly more tolerable.  But I have a 5 year old $100 piece of crap 20\" sharp TV that gets crystal clear reception from the same cable box and connection.  I have talked to Syntax about this and they assured me that it was the signal coming into the TV.  Since then I have changed cable boxes, used different wires, tried different inputs, had the cable company install a signal amplifier, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem.  My cable provider (Comcast) offers mostly analog channels for the most popular stations, digital channels for the higher number cable channels and a few HDTV channels.  If your cable provider is the same way, I would STRONGLY advise against buying this unit.  Other than the fact that you can't watch about 75% of the channels from my cable box, the only other complaint I would have is that the remote is very poorly designed.  Also, now that it has taken me a little over a month to figure out that it is absolutely the TV that is causing this, I don't have the opportunity to return it anymore.  So I paid $1000 for this unit to watch a few HD channels... what a ripoff.EDIT:After having this TV for a while, I think my criticism was much too harsh.  Its still true that some analog channels don't come in and the remote is absurd, but I am happy with everything else about the TV.  For some reason about half the analog stations come in fine and half are somewhat fuzzy, though I have noticed similar things with other HDTVs.  The picture on the digital channels actually is fine, I think its a bit underwhelming due more to the signal coming through my cable box.  The picture on the HDTV channels is spectacular.  Maybe other high end TVs reportedly have better colors or whatever but I'm telling you that watching football, baseball, basketball, nature shows, etc is mesmerizing.  Some other nice features that I have discovered are the removable speakers that can be wired directly to your stereo receiver, split screen mode (awesome for watching 2 football games at once) and the numerous inputs available.  Also, the packaging of the TV when I received it was great.  I saw some reviews complaining about the packaging, but I would not worry about that if you are planning on purchasing this TV.Reconsidering, I would give this TV 4 stars instead of 2.","Date":"September 3, 2005"}

{"Title":"Am I missing something here???","Author":"Avallach","ReviewID":"R3BKXIX9BH20QE","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw the 27\" version of this TV on the floor of our CompUSA store for $700 (with the rebates) and wondered what was the catch. Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent. Just wish I got my damn rebates!!!!","Date":"March 8, 2005"}

{"Title":"Olevia Review","Author":"Thy","ReviewID":"R20FRSL3A0TJZW","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. <br /><br />But if you want to find out some more, or see more pictures. Go check out my profile at [...] . My username is virebelrus .

{"Title":"Syntax Olevia 27?","Author":"larry fraser","ReviewID":"R6EO4IAW2GI7H","Overall":"good","Content":"Had this monitor for 3 months now.  Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor.  Great for xbox using progressive component.  For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video.  Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt.  Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720).  As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back.  I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal.  Overall I like the monitor and for under $1000 it is probably one of the best buys out there for a 27 inch monitor/tv.","Date":"February 7, 2005"}

The images are clean and sharp and the colors are great. I found that I had make sure all my wire connections were good to the get a good picture.  The DVD image is also great , but I am more amazed with how nornal cable TV looks on this TV. I have been looking for a LCD TV for some time now  and have been reading tons of reviews and going to several stores and thought I would take a change on the Syntax.

{"Title":"Initial offering of this TV was horrible - has it changed?","Author":"Wreckinball","ReviewID":"RTRJYC0X1UPYO","Overall":"bad","Content":"Back in April of last year I went looking for a LCD and first tried out the Olevia which was returned immediately, I then bought the Sceptre LCD which has been fantastic.  Below is part of a review I wrote on the AVS Forum website.  I think it touched on all the shortcomings of the Olevia.Sceptre 30\" vs. Syntax Olevia 30\" the results are in....I see there are a few threads with folks asking and comparing the Sceptre LCD at (...) and the Syntax Olevia LCD. I had the Olevia for a week and I just got the Sceptre yesterday. I think I'm the only one who's had both, so here is my experience that I posted on one of the threads. I hope this will help those wondering which one to buy. If you don't want to read the results, Olevia sucks and the Sceptre is great so far.-------------------------I went looking for a LCD at a good price. It had to have PAL support since I'm going to use it overseas. Found 2 options, Sharp and Olevia. Sharp 22\" was expensive and was only EDTV, so did some research on Olevia. Well there really wasn't any info out there at all. They mostly do motherboards, LCD is a new venture for them.Here is my experience... The spec's on the Olevia were nice on paper, the price was right....Setup was easy, my wife did it while I was at work. My first thought was that the brightness wasn't very good. So I did some adjusting and got it to look alright, but still not thrilled. I hooked up my Toshiba DVD via component input and played a few movies. Traffic, Finding Nemo, Usual Suspects, LOTR, Final Fantasy, COPS, and a few others. Finding Nemo looked the best, and I just credit that with the fantastic job that they did making the movie in the first place. The reds were really overblown everytime, and it was still not the best brightness. The listed contrast ratio is 700:1 when I originally bought it, now I see it's up to 750:1 and I wonder how they came to that conclusion, I figure it's more like 400:1 in reality. Overall color, contrast, and brightness are subpar.The quality of the remote was the dealbreaker for sure. The volume would change when hitting the channel button, the volume would increase when you hit the down volume regularly. When I pressed track forward on my DVD remote it would change the volume too!! When that happen I knew that using my Sony commander remote wouldn't make a difference. The remote on the Olevia is absolute junk, they must have spent $1 on making it. The 2 items that drove me to return it was when switching from DVD (via Y, Pb, Pr) to the TV input the screen went PINK with a couple lines of static (I could hear the TV audio)! The only solution was to turn it off and on. Then I e-mailed Syntax Olevia with my problems to see what they would say, my message got bounced.....I hope this review will help people make a decision whether or not to buy the Olevia (I had the 30\" not that makes a difference compared to the 27\"). I did some more reading and found the Sceptre Naga III ....It has PAL support and Sceptre is an respected LCD monitor manufacturer. Dell offers their monitors on their website and last year Wired magazine rated their 17\" LCD TV as a best buy.....So from my experience with the Olevia and the Sceptre, the Sceptre is a far better LCD. It's not even close IMO, so if I were you I'd scrap plans for the Olevia and buy the Sceptre. And for the record, I'm not just comparing as joe schmo, I'm an engineer and work in non-linear video editing and photography.","Date":"May 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"Great, second-tier LCD TV even after 10 years...","Author":"CriticalEye","ReviewID":"RQO9YRLU4GXZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased a Syntax LT30HV nearly 10 years ago for approximately $1,300.  It's been used regularly for the past 10 years with no issues at all.  This is an early LCD TV that was modeled after the top-ranked Sharp Aquos models of the same vintage (about 2003-2004).  The speakers are detachable and any other stereo speakers may be directly connected to this TV in their place.  The 720p image is extremely sharp as noted by other reviewers.  The image driven from a laptop or computer via the DVI port is equally sharp.  Just amazing, really.  Standard definition channels are hit or miss, but are generally acceptable.Comparing 10 year old flat-panel TVs to new ones, is interesting.  The Syntax feels like a tank, very well made and very heavy, while new TV's feel flimsy and light.  Of course, new ones are a fraction of the cost (about one tenth), the picture is higher resolution and multiple HDMI ports are available.  Just the Syntax carton is a work of art, a double box design mad from high-quality cardboard.I had a Roku 2 XS hooked up to it for a while using just the analog inputs and it looked fine.  On a whim, I purchased an HDMI to DVI adapter via eBay for $2 and connected the Roku's HDMI output to the Syntax DVI with the adapter.  Wow!  A nice crisp 720p image.  Sound does not travel over DVI, so I also hooked up an audio cable between the Roku's analog out and the audio in on the Syntax.  Success!  The Roku apparently (and thankfully) outputs simultaneously via both the analog and HDMI ports.The worst thing that I can report is that via the remote, source switching is overly complicated.Wrapping up, this had been a really nice TV and it will continue to be used in a guest bedroom.","Date":"February 2, 2014"}

It cost me $1350 at the time when LCDs were far more expensive that they are today.  Very nice build and nice design, with attached speakers that can be mounted on the wall away from the computer if desired. Breaking it down over 10 yrs of usage, it cost me approx $135 a year + a one time $80 for an inverter card that I replaced myself.  I did have to replace the inverter card last year 2013 to fix a black screen problem.  Cons of this TV is cheap remote control and low contrast video that cannot compare with the brightness of screens today.

all LCDs.  We have had no other problems with one exception.  The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level.  At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3.  It cuts out and fritzs.  I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael","Date":"July 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"@2 years: Power failures and screen goes black","Author":"Cara","ReviewID":"R12VDKP2G25KJW","Overall":"bad","Content":"Odds are, if you are looking at reviews for this television, you've got one and you're having problems with it.This happened to me, and after looking on the web, it looks like a number of bugs have been reported:1) The screen flashes blue, then goes black, but you can still hear audio. If you turn the unit off, the blue \"standby\" light still illuminates, but if you turn it on again, the screen is dead, or lights for a while and then goes dead.2) The TV goes dead: no sound, no picture, no standby3) Flickering of colors, etc.In my case, after 30 months of use, I got the first problem, where it would flicker and then go to a black screen, first when using a PS3 via DVI, and later with HDTV cable through the component cables. Needless to say, this was disappointing after paying 1.3k in November 2004. Up until this point, the picture and sound had been reliable and good, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.It turns out that the root cause for issue (1) is the Darfon 144 LCD inverter, which generates power to light up the backlight. A number of manufacturers use this part and had the same bug. Based on research at yahoo groups, where there is a list called syntax_lcd, you can fix this by either (a) getting a new inverter board for a couple hundred, (b) removing and re-soldering the transformers to the board to fix bad solders, or (c) replacing a couple specific transistors that are testing poorly.Items 2 and 3 above are driven by a complete or partial failure of the power module. There are also other issues driven by a failure of the motherboard. The yahoo group forum does a good job listing and addressing the problems if you read through a couple hundred comments, you'll find your issue, as well as a few others.The group chats include a number of folks had luck with fixes for all three, and I plan to go down that path in a few weeks. Hopefully it will eke another couple of years of life out of the set, but this might be a good excuse to upgrade to a larger 1080p set.","Date":"June 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"One word...cheap","Author":"J. Rogers","ReviewID":"R3NI8AB6IU40GX","Overall":"bad","Content":"To be honest, I don't have this exact product.  I have it's 'twin', the Syntax Kolin DLT-2711M.  A few weeks shy of two years of ownership, the television died, for lack of a better word.  At that point, the power off LED would not be lit but the television would not be on and I could not turn it on.  Unplugging the television for a time served as a temporary fix, but now the tv is out completely.  My suspicion is that it's a bad power supply (while it didn't solve the problem, I noticed upon inspection that the AC socket 'legs' had broken from the PS and needed to be re-soldered).I've noticed other reviews with a similar problem - the blue/black screen of death.  A Yahoo group devoted to Syntax LCDs has solved that problem if you're interested.  While not the same issue I have, they both stem from cheap construction - substandard components and shoddy manufacturing.That being said, the television performed adequately while it worked and was rather inexpensive.  In fact, Syntax-Brillian has continued to market budget-conscious LCD TVs with some success.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for and that includes customer service (however, Syntax's tech support is reportedly more helpful if you actually get through to them).  I think next time I'll buy from a more reputable manufacturer.Caveat emptor.","Date":"January 5, 2008"}

So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}

I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"No picture after less than 2 weeks of use!  UPDATE","Author":"Gary A. Bergman","ReviewID":"R3TENMGV1HB3X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I did a lot of research on LCD TV's, and in my research Syntax Groups kept on popping up. It received very good reviews from most electronics magazines, and so with much antipation I ordered the 30\" TV. When I received it I hooked it up to my cable, DVD, and stereo. I immediately had problems. When I tried to route my TV through my stereo system, I found out that by turning my stereo on first, I would loose all power to the TV. The blue light would go out; my remote control would not turn the TV on, nor would the manuel buttons work on the TV. The only way I could turn it on would be to unplug it from the outlet and plug it back in. I called Syntax support and he couldn't figure it out either. I tried using a different outlet for my stereo, but to no avail. I purchased a surge protector, by that did not prevent it either. And now, just the other day, the picture went completely black in the middle of a TV program- no blue screen or anything when I turn it on, although the sound works. It is broke after less than 2 weeks! I am really disappointed. I am considering returning the product back to the on-line store where I bought it from. When it was working, I was completely satisfied with the quality of the picture. This is a good product when working, but I wonder if LCD technology is all that reliable. I might revert back to the old CRTV until they get it right. So if you're thinking of buying one, good luck. I hope it is much more reliable than mine was!April 4: This is an update to my previous review dated March 6, 2005. When I discovered that my 30\" Olevia was defective as discribed in my previous review, I decided to call Syntax support to report the problem. They were very curtious and knowledgable and immediately recommeded that I return the TV to them for a new one. Everything was arranged by Syntax. UPS picked up the old one and one week later, right on que, my new one arrived. I immediately hooked it up and it has been running great ever since. At first I had some streaking in fast-action scences, but I retuned the TV with my cable box turned on, and that solved the problem.One week later, my telephone company installed a new digital cable system. This is the latest technology and far superior to the old analog system. Their cable box is a small modem through which comes my telephone; DSL, and cable TV.Some notes of advice: If you have the connections, use the S-Video input on your Syntax to view either cable or Satellite TV. Even though it will not be High Def. it will be much superior to the RF connection. The picture is much brighter and clearer and the flesh tones are great. Also, use your Component connections for your DVD player/recorder. This also is much superior in quality to the RF connection.I am very happy with this TV. I'm glad I made the dicision to return the old one. I would recommend this TV to anyone. I rate this product 4 1/2 stars","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

{"Title":"This thing is going back","Author":"Alfred Penitent","ReviewID":"R1J2N0MMCVD1Y3","Overall":"bad","Content":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I was really excited to get this.  After using it for 5 minutes, I knew it was going back.  Reviews of this seem to be either glowing or harsh, without much middle ground.  I think the people who like it are those who care only about picture quality, and don't want to use many of its features.  If you only want a TV monitor for a bright room, the picture and sound are great.  However, there are many bad things about this unit that make it just not worth it.  Where do I begin:Black level & buzz - even with the backlight down low, a full black screen on this will light up your room.  And with the backlight on low, the built-in speakers emit a horrible loud buzz.  It is not a faint hum as I read before buying, it is a LOUD buzz.  I don't understand why LCD makers think we want these things as bright at the sun, I am much more concerned with having black look black.Computer - forget about using this as a monitor.  There is no Windows driver for it.  You can tweak it to look good with a 3rd party tool called PowerStrip, but even then any mode change causes it to slip back into unreadable mode.  And DVI did NOT work with my brand new computer - I had to use a VGA cable.  I heard that if it does work, it will only show a signal after windows starts, so you can't see the boot process or DOS.  The screen is far too bright (or loud) to use for hours at a time without eyestrain.Remote - The remote barely works - you have to press each button 2-5 times to get it to go through, and then it only has a 6 foot range.Interface - The menu system is asinine, with the center button being cancel, and \"right\" being enter.  After much use I still can't get used to it, and it still takes a lot of thought to figure out how to do simple tasks.  Just about everything you do has a 5 second delay as the monitor changes modes.Misc - The headphone jack is in the back behind a screw panel, limited aspect ratios (3), very bad std tv image.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it will be good for people who have no desire to use its features or remote.Even if they fixed half of these problems I wouldn't want this unit.  It just has way too many issues.  The sad thing is they all would be pretty simple issues for the manufacturer to fix.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}

{"Title":"Sounds like a crapshoot  LT27HV","Author":"Tom Urbanik \"2jaded2care\"","ReviewID":"R31MPVQ4JEEF4B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have taken the time to read almost 100 of these reviews good and bad, and some people get the lemons, some don't, and some may not even know they got a lemon.Although I did not get my Syntax LCD tv from Amazon, I have purchased other things like pots and pans.  From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. &#60;br /&#62;<br />","Date":"December 10, 2004"}

The color is not as bright or vivid but the ability to receive and play HD programs does let one peek into the future of digital programmings and that itself is an enjoyable experience.The LT30HV has considerable weakness in the DVI mode, often the display will exhibit no picture or incorrect color scheme, 6 months to a year after opening the box. For the majority, this would not be an issue since only very few consumers use DVI mode to watch TV.However a larger concern is that there has been a number of TV that exhibits a water mark patch behind the display screen, the size can vary from 20% to 50% of the screen. This slight discoloration can take the fun out of having the LCD TV.For the price advertised here, it is definately not worth it.","Date":"March 21, 2006"}

For the price, I was not too concerned about all the technical details but when I finally got it home and played around with it: I knew that it wouldn't be in my house for long.PROBLEMS:1. Adjusting for proper brightness/sharpness/hue/contrast is all over the place. Just when you think you've got it tweaked to a reasonable picture - change to a different channel and you have to start all over again. I'm sorry but I'm not going to adjust all those options every time the channel changes.2. No sleep timer??? Whoever decided to omit this very basic feature was definitely asleep at the drawing board. I've got $50 TV's that have a sleep time on it.3. Sound was pretty weak on it too but the least of my problems.I cannot believe that people are raving about this TV. I understand the 27\" and 30\" are better than the cost-saving measures they applied to the 20\".Even though it was a cheap TV (almost disposable at that price).

{"Title":"*****Beware - QC Issues with Olevia*****","Author":"L.I. NY Prof.","ReviewID":"RYT82PISLCZIN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Dear Amazon Shoppers,Beware of ordering this Olevia LT30HV 30\" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV.My experience was 180 degrees different from the November 4, 2004 review from MIMI'm a very big believer in buying through the Internet.  Unfortunately, after reading that review, I did order the Olevia for my Son's birthday.  The TV arrived defective.  The audio worked just fine, but the video would not work.Olevia packages the TV with a sheet directing you to call their toll free number in case there is a problem.  I called the 800 number and described the problem to them. Olevia's tech support advised that the motherboard needed to be replaced.  Olevia offered to send me a new motherboard that would be installed by a local technician, BUT advised it would take 3 days from date of shipment to receive, and since it was now Friday, I would have to call back on Monday since all shipments were already picked up.  Compounding the issue was the fact that I couldn't schedule a tech until the motherboard arrived.Olevia suggested that I contact Amazon.  After an hour of searching Amazon's site, I realized that Amazon does not offer an option to call them.  There's no phone number on their site.  You must submit a form, explain the problem in writing, and request resolution.  I submitted the form and didn't hear back for 3 days.Here's the email response I received:==============================Greetings from Amazon.com.I realize that you have experienced a lot of inconvenience.  Isincerely apologize for the inconvenience experienced by you.  I hope you can accept our sincerest apologies for this order.As the item is very sensitive and is to be handled very delicately, this item can only be shipped through Standard shipping.  You would be aware that standard shipping may take around five to six days to reach the item at your door steps.Understanding the criticalities of the time as you require the item for a birthday gift.  If you still need the item we would be happy to make the replacement or else we will refund you in full including the shipping charges.Please write back to us using the link provided at the end of the message as to how would you like us to proceed.Thank you for your understanding in this matter.Please visit the following link to provide the information werequested:Please note: this e-mail was sent from an address that cannot accept incoming e-mail.  Please use the link above to send us your reply.Best regards,Pramod T.Amazon.com Customer Servicehttp://www.amazon.com==============================Given the urgency of the occasion, I went to a local store and purchased a replacement LCD TV for my son's birthday.I responded back to Amazon requesting that they pick up the defective TV.  They advised via return email that the package would be picked up \"usually within a day or two\".To Amazon's credit, they did have the TV picked up the next day.I can't begin to describe the inconvenience.  Imagine the time involved in selecting the TV on Amazon's website.  Ordering, waiting at home for the delivery and the return.  Writing countless letters back and forth (I've not yet received any indication that they've credited my credit card for the returned item), and ultimately replacing the TV with a brand name (Panasonic) at a local merchant.Compare that to my experience purchasing the replacement.  The replacement was purchased from a local merchant.  The local merchant gave me a better price for the name brand merchandise than Amazon was charging for the identical unit.  The merchant delivered the set to my home with same day service (I tipped the salesman $100 to drop it off after work).  My son got his birthday present on his Birthday and it worked right out of the box.Bottom line: DON'T BUY this set from Olevia.Amazon is a great company.  But... I think they should have a toll free number for returns of defective merchandise and respond quicker (to be fair, Amazon's response may have been quicker if it hadn't been so close to the Xmas season)I've had very good experiences with Amazon, but I would NEVER buy anything with a critical time line (birthday, Xmas gifts, etc.) from Amazon again.  Perhaps they should stick with books and DVD's.  I would definitely think twice about ordering electronic equipment from them again.","Date":"December 21, 2004"}

I have it plugged into my Cablevision service for HD signal - the step up in picture quality compared to standard signal is quite noticeable. But the good thing is that even standard TV transmission (non HD) produces very good picture on this TV (which was a factor in its best buy choice by Consumer Reports). The TV has plenty of video inputs of all kinds, including 2 component video and 1 HDMI.I have my Panasonic S97 DVD player hooked up to this TV via HDMI input and this allows my Panasonic DVD player to upconvert DVD's to 1080i so I can watch them as clear as the HD TV. Granted that the DVD upconvert to 1080i is a Panasonic DVD player feature but you can't use it without having HDMI input on the TV.According to the Consumer Reports review of HD TV's, most HD TV's produce great picture with the HD signal but the picture quality is not so good with standard TV signal. Since most of the programming on TV continues to be transmitted via the standard signal, this TV's very good performance with the standard TV signal was a big factor in my buying decision.","Date":"March 24, 2005"}

Be warned that if this is your first HD tv, you will probably need to spend about $150 buying new cables to take advantage of the HD features when you hook up your dvd player and cable box to the tv.  I bought two sets of Monster brand cables for my Comcast DVR cable box and my dvd player.This tv is HEAVY!  My husband and I managed to carry this down steps from our driveway into the house and then down a flight of steps into our basement tv room, but that's only because he's very strong.  You really need at least 2 strong people to carry this.  If you buy locally and can't find help, it would be worth it to pay for delivery and set up.We did have some problems hooking up our cable box to the tv, as Sony's directions are not clear, but we finally got everything working. We have Comcast digital cable and receive a number of HD broadcasts and the picture quality is unbelievable!  Our dvds look equally as great.If you are considering a new tv, I would highly recommend this model.","Date":"June 25, 2005"}

All my DVDs are in widescreen format and I'm finally getting to watch them how they are meant to be watched!Edit: October 19th, 2006After now almost 2 years, I had to get my TV calibrated mostly because of recommendations to get the the best Picture I could get out of this TV. I regret I didn't do this earlier. The picture was great but now it is just plain fantastic. Red push is gone, overscan corrected, picture Sharper than it was, the Black level is phenomenal, I saw details in movie that I never knew they were there. The overall PQ improved. Dvds running at 720p or 1080i are fantastic thanks to the upconversion of my DVD player.The only downside of this set I own is the little bowing on the corners. But we all know that CRT set never had and never will have 100% correct geometry.It doesn't bother me. If you can get it calibrated, do it! You won't regret it.","Date":"July 19, 2005"}

I purchased a HDTV for playing my Xbox and Gamecube in high def. Most games on the market right now support 480p, and some games even support 1080i! Even though only a few games support THAT resolution, my console games look really good in 480p. There is such a big difference in picture quality...it's astounding. The major reason though is that the next gen consoles will support HD as well, with all games running in at least 720p. Can't wait for that.Cable looks great as well. Channels that are 1080i in widescreen are freaking increadible. Normal channels...so-so. Sometimes they look pretty good, but the picture is a bit on the grainy side.This is a great HDTV. Even though the price is a  bit steep, I think it's well worth it. Remember to buy component cables to watch tv and other devices in high def. Channels that support HD are amazing, and my games are awesome. Get the 34 inch model if you're in a bigger room though.","Date":"August 11, 2005"}

{"Title":"Beauty and Beast","Author":"Jeco","ReviewID":"R1SZ127AEOSFTG","Overall":"good","Content":"Beauty - I bought the Wega off Craigslist for $300 in 2008.  We were not in the HD upgrade market, we just needed a TV since our 27\" Sony Trinitron took on a little lightning.  Being a huge fan of Sony's TVs from years past I was only searching the terms \"Sony TV\".  I didn't even know the Wega was widescreen or HD until I went to the sellers house to see it. He was watching the World Series in HD. He was actually pretty upset that I had money and a truck with me, and he was going to have listen to the rest of the game on the radio.  I think if it weren't for his wife being there I would have left with no TV.I didn't have any HD content to dazzle my wife with at home so I put on a Pixar DVD, Monsters Inc. Even with the signal fed through S-Video, we were both blown away by the improved detail in picture quality. You could actually count Sully's hairs if you were half insane or Rain Man.  But they were all there, all 4,987,653 of them.Since it was HD (1080i), we (my wife) didn't have an excuse to not have a BluRay player anymore, so we (I) decided to get a Sony BluRay to move us into the new era of our life (on the couch).  BluRays look spectacular! We still only get SD from our satellite system, but even that looks fantastic.  This past Christmas (2011) we added an xBox to our family and I'm still blown away by the picture quality.  Baring any more lightning, I expect to have the Wega for many more years.Beast - The Wega weighs slightly less than my house.  I often wonder if the slathering of good reviews of these TVs are written by people (like me) who don't want to come to terms with the fact that someday they will have to move this thing again.  I am holding out hope that when it finally dies, it just turns to dust and we can sweep it up and sprinkle it over the garden and grow some HD vegetables in the next season.","Date":"March 1, 2012"}

Everyone thought it was stupid and a waste of money to buy a CRT HDTV, but they quickly shut up after seeing the picture quality.  They then thought it would die after a year of use... it hasn't.The picture quality of the set is truly excellent, especially when watching a good Bluray disc.  The speakers are loud and have plenty of bass (something all flat panels lack imo) and I've never noticed any sort of lag, wether playing video games on xbox 360 or watching a high paced movie.  I use my TV a lot, and often leave it on while I'm using my computer for hours, it's still performing excellently.Recently it has started to show some artifacts and \"fuzz\" along the middle lines of the screen, but only when the screen is pure black (I only notice it when it's not receiving a signal).  I'm finally going to upgrade to a Plasma this year, but only because this screen is too small for me, that's literally the only drawback.  I'm keeping this TV as an extra set in another room and if it keeps on being as reliable as it has been, I expect to own it for many years to come!If you find one of these gems for sale on your local craigslist and need a nice HD set for next to nothing, don't hesitate to pick one up!","Date":"April 12, 2011"}
{"Title":"Awsome affordable high quality HDTV","Author":"R. Mena","ReviewID":"R340SDG6HS4JQ0","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all I want to say that Im a filmmaker and know about TV and film quite a lot so I know what Im talking about. Anyone that knows about TV's knows that CRT/picture-tube TV's (the fat ones) will produce superior image quality than any comprable LCD monitor. Just because a TV is thin and flat does not mean that it will produce a better image quality. Thin TV's are all the rage right now but what trully should matter is the picture quality. My Sony 30\" widescreen HDTV's image quality is awsome. I've had it for about a year now and have been very, very, happy with it. Yes, it is super bulky and heavy but it fits in the corner of my bedroom quite well and its picture tube is super flat. Plus, the design of the TV makes it look a lot thinner than it really is. I've had to point out to guests that my TV is not a thin TV. The other cool thing about CRT HDTV monitors are that they cost about 40% less than flat LCD or plasma TV's. And like I said before, LCD will not give the same picture quality as CRT's. Plasma TV's do compare to CRT's but they cost a lot more and unlike CRT's you don't have recharge the chemicals like you do in plasmas after about 3000 hours of viewing time. Plus, I got my TV as a brand new clearance item at Fry's for $600! Trust me, I did a lot of research and this model had it all. About the only thing I wish it had was a third HDMI input and the capacity to broadcast at 1080p.","Date":"February 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Still superior to LCD and Plasma","Author":"John Zane \"Johnzane\"","ReviewID":"R16XZ58A61R9C0","Overall":"good","Content":"I thought I was going to spring for a Pioneer Kuro 50\", after extensive research and comparison, it's pretty much the top of the top when it comes to quality, and I got a great deal for my buddy, who loves it. But in comparison, I only watch my 18 year old 27\" TV a couple of hours a day, and I don't entertain with it on, so dropping $3K on a new set made no sense. I remember seeing the prototype of the Sony widescreen HD CRT sets in Tokyo in 1989, about $15K at the time, and I promised myself I would own one, once the price dropped. And voila! Almost 20 years later, my dream has come true. So can yours, if you can live with the difference in size, picture quality, and energy consumption. Yes, it's quite a bit deeper, but if you are replacing an old CRT, like mine (which died yesterday), you probably won't mind. As you already know, besides the Kuro, no LCD nor plasma is going to give you the detail and contrast (blacks) that a CRT will. And the thing nobody ever talks about is that CRTs will consume much less power than either LCD or plasma. The late model Wegas all come HDMI ready, which is required for all the upgrades coming with digital television broadcast next year, and though this 30\" Sony will not achieve 1080p, it doesn't have to, because that resolution is wasted on any screen smaller than 50\", a fact nobody here seems to acknowledge. I would go so far as to say, if you are not a film maker, you are wasting your time worrying about anything higher than 720p, which this set achieves. Still want to spend $900 at Costco or Best Buy for a comparable plasma? I bought my tv from a gamer who fell hard for his $4K Kuro, and sold his 1 year old Sony to me for...$180! I could have gotten the top of the line 36\"XBR widescreen with matching stand for $450 used, but the point is, if you are looking for a bargain basement HDTV deal, for less than the price of a new Blueray DVD player, now is the time. Once you hook up that new HD DVD player, you'll forget all about that wall mount.","Date":"June 10, 2008"}

The picture and sound are great, and the price is right. But why oh why does new technology have to be so complicated! (This is not a problem, of course, if your college age son is home from vacation to set it all up, but we weren't so lucky). It took us two visits from the store installation crew and a visit from the cable company before we felt reasonably sure we could get it to work. This is not a knock on this model, only a general comment--getting a product like this into the house and getting it to work is a cumbersome process. If I had to do it over I'd get the TV from the lowest priced supplier around and hire the local electronics store to come around and set it up.

Weisgal","ReviewID":"RV1AQLROKVXKF","Overall":"good","Content":"I feel as though most people make a purchase, and then justify it by raving about it's performance, even if in their heart of hearts they know it is junk.Just recently, an acquaintance of mine purchased an LCD television that, while asthetically pleasing, has one of the worst pictures I have seen.  Trail, ghosting, poor colors, etc...  DLP projection is simply the best picture you can buy if dollars spent VS. quality of picture is your goal. If you MUST hang a TV on a wall, KNOW that you MUST ALSO spend at least $7000 for a picture that begins to match the quality of a $2500 DLP.  The cheaper flat screens are cheaper for a reason.  You do the math.This Samsung model is just gorgeous.  HDTV is simply stunning.  Colors are crisp, black levels are INCREDIBLE, and the picture is 95% perfect right out of the box!  I had an engineer look at this set and say \"it is perfect when you plug it in\".  So many sets need \"tweaking\" for days before they look right, so this is an added benefit on this model.Also, the set has PIP, which can be used for watching TV while also using your computer!  Simply run video out from your computer and you have a 50 inch HD Monitor!!  Awsome!This set has HDMI, which no one really uses yet, but it is nice to have for the future.  For those who do not know, HDMI is ONE cable that carries HD PICTURE AND SURROUND SOUND.  It also has DVI input for the BEST HDTV picture available.The look (pedestal) is love it or leave it, but if you are here, you obviously find it pleasing.I can not comment on the sound as I have never used it (I have a home theater system), and this brings me to a slightly offpoint comment, but one that is important.  if you DO get a surround system, please do this television justice and do not buy some junky home theater in a box!  Sound is actually MORE impotant than picture in terms of a visceral experience, and you do yourself no service to buy this set, and then use garbage sound. Also, BOSE, while nice, is overpriced and simply silly.  DO RESEARCH, and find that no respected audio/videophile respects BOSE, when they know better can be had for less.Sorry...back to my review.  This set is wonderful.  You can use a nice open-air AV rack to complement it visually, and as far as gaming goes, XBOX in HD is fabulous!!!ONE NOTE ON DVD's.  this television has a native resolution of 720P  DVD's only have a maximum of 480P, and as a technology, DVD's are not that great, which is why HD DVD's will be out this year (DVD's that do 480p,720p,1080i,1080p ie. High Definition DVD's) Do not be disappointed if DVD's look a bit fuzzy, pixelated, whatever... they look that way on ALL HDTV's.  It is the DVD, not the TV.  Still, they look nice.Well, that's all.  You may want to wait until 1080 native resolution sets are available later this year, but mind you they come with a hefty price tag!  For now, this is THE set; and I say that not because I own it, but because it is true. Enjoy!TOP NOTES:PROS:Good ClarityGREAT BLACK LEVELSNice ContrastBEST COLOR ON THE MARKETIt is light...about 100lbs for a 50 Inch TV!!!!!CONS:Can't hang it on a wall (it IS only 11 inches deep)Pedestal not for everyone","Date":"January 5, 2005"}

{"Title":"Ignorance","Author":"D. Berndt","ReviewID":"RJZU6O2AVWPLD","Overall":"good","Content":"You should rate products based on their quality not your ignorance.  \"HD ready\" is a term used in every store which means that it is capable of producing a HD quality picture when provided with a source (i.e. a HD tuner or HD cable box).  If it has \"integrated HD\" then you know it has a built in tuner.  Do some research before you bash a product and a company.This is an outtake from bestbuy's websiteWhat's meant by \"HD-Ready\"?Some HDTV sets on the market incorporate HD-capable displays coupled with a built-in HDTV tuner to receive over-the-air HD broadcasts (currently available only in certain markets, these broadcasts are becoming increasingly common as the 2006 digital-broadcast deadline approaches). Often referred to as integrated HDTVs, these models are indicated on the BestBuy.com Web site by the designation \"with Built-In HDTV Tuner.\"However, the vast majority of HD-capable TVs on the market are what's known as HD-ready TVs (or HDTV monitors) - high-definition displays, often including one or more built-in NTSC TV tuners for reception of conventional analog TV broadcasts, but which must be connected to a separate HD source in order to realize their full potential. Since most current HD content is delivered via satellite or cable systems rather that over-the-air, some consumers (especially those who reside in areas where over-the-air HD content is not yet available) consider an HD-ready set to be the best solution for their current and future needs. But to experience HD broadcasts (where available) right out of the box with no additional investment, a built-in HD tuner is the ticket.Like HD-ready models, integrated HDTVs generally provide exhaustive connectivity options, so you can always add cable or satellite sources as well to broaden your HD options. Conversely, over-the-air HD tuners are also available in stand-alone set-top boxes, often combined with cable and/or satellite reception capabilities. Obviously, there are lots of ways to achieve your desired HD viewing experience, so we advise you to weigh various factors (including cost, convenience, and content availability) before making your decision.","Date":"October 15, 2004"}

With the integral stand, your component (receiver, DVD Player, etc...) storage options are limited to the funky stand made for this TV.2.  Direct-access to the input ports doesn't work.  It makes programming a remote, especially the \"too smart for their own good\" Logitech remotes, extremely difficult.  Attempting any sort of programming to directly switch to the HDMI, DVI or other ports simply doesn't work.  You have to use the \"Cycle\" method, and that also fails most of the time.

{"Title":"Center Piece for Home Theatre","Author":"Snowdwarf","ReviewID":"R2EYRIXOKYCWK9","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is absolutely wonderful as you may have noticed from other reviews.  I have had this for about 1 year and have had no problems.  The fan is so quiet and the picture quality in HD and black levels are great.  I have an XBOX 360 hooked up with a component inputs and the games look spectacular.  Coupled with an elegant stand, it really makes the living room. One other bonus is the DVI and HDMI inputs for true digital picture and sound from higher end DVD and HD boxes, and input of computers.  Surfing the internet on 50\" couldn't be more fun.Downsides I would say are the heftiness of moving this TV and sound inputs.  Find a good spot and leave it there as it does have a glass bottom for the stand. It could use some digital sound inputs as well such as optical or coaxial.Other than that all you do is plug it in and go.  It looks perfect right out of the box.  It does not produce much heat at all which is also a benefit if you have it in a smaller room with many other a/v products attached.This TV has been the best a/v product purchase I have ever made.  DLP will continue to be the leader in picture quality and price from here on.","Date":"November 26, 2006"}

{"Title":"The worst money I've EVER spent!","Author":"Timothy D. Wainscott \"Psychedelia Fan\"","ReviewID":"R2ZJ3YDVAFE7ET","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this set 11/04 for $3,539.97 from Circuit City.  I did EXTENSIVE research before plunking all that $$ down on a TV.  The pundits were very clear:  for a big high-def TV DLP was the way to go and Samsung was the best at DLP.Liars!!The second year I owned it I had all my friends over watching NFL Kickoff Sunday.  Just as the kickoff was about to happen on the second round of games --KABOOM!  It sounded like a shotgun going off!  What it was was the bulb had blown up -- that took $300.00 and 5 days to get rectified.  OK, I was warned about the bulb issue.  I got over it.After I had the set for 3 years and 1 month suddenly these black pinstripes (10 sets of 8 pinstripes) appeared over the whole screen, just like that.  Samsung was as interested in helping me as a US Marine wants to get Osama bin Laden a cold glass of water and a pillow.So I call a local TV repairman and he came out to have a look.  A VERY nice man and quite intelligent as well.  He told me that the DMD board went bad and Samsung charges $750.00 for a replacement board, plus $200.00 labor to install.  He warned me that in DLP's the color wheel tends to go bad as well and they are equally as expensive to replace.I asked him why a 3000+ dollar TV doesn't last for at least 10 years, like my old trusty Toshiba tube TV?  He said that the new technology TV's -  DLP, plasma, LCD - have an average user life of 2-4 years.  That's right, you read correctly -- 2-4 years!!!I figured quickly that buying a new set that is current would cost me ~ $1300.00 and fixing the Samsung would be throwing good money after bad.I went ahead and bought a cheap Sanyo 46\" LCD -- looks EVERY BIT as good as the Samsung did in it's prime.  Plus, it was hella easier to set up and such.Buyer beware -- Samsung is really bad.If you do buy a new HDTV, be sure to put out the extra bucks to get at least 3 years insurance on it, regardless the brand.  It's a little extra money but will be well worth it if your set is a lemon.It will be interesting to see if the glowing reports on this set are still \"glowing\" after a couple years passes.","Date":"June 7, 2008"}

Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it. From what I can tell from looking on television repair forums, Samsung televisions look to be pretty flakey.","Date":"June 22, 2009"}

The picture quality was very good for it's time, and the style of this tv is out of this world.  As soon as my warranty expired I started having issues with this tv. I hardly ever used it(average use once a week), and took very good care of it.  So in my opnion these problems shouldn't occur so early, and the tv itself now is near unusable.  My tv is plagued with green pixels scattered across the screen, and basically you don't know what you're looking at anymore.  This happens every time I use it, and majority of anything I watch is infested with green pixels.Trying to find a fix for the problem, I was told time after time, that many people are having issues with this model. That and Samsung needs to send a Tech out to troubleshoot the tv, and I was told not to go this route. I'd suggest if you'd get an HDTV, that you look at other models with a better failure rate.","Date":"October 13, 2007"}

{"Title":"Withstands the test of time","Author":"M. Clark \"Nerd Alert\"","ReviewID":"R3NR0ED9S4JILF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using the HLP5685W for almost ten years now and could not be more pleased with it. DLP technology is still commonly used in projectors, but DLP TVs have mostly disappeared. However, they have some significant advantages which have led to me keeping this set over purchasing an LED LCD or Plasma in recent years. In particular, the ability to replace the DLP bulb (and color wheel if needed) means that the TV can be kept as crisp and clear as it was when it was brand new even ten years later. I know from having other LCDs and Plasmas that this is not true for them.In 2004, when this set was released, it was the cutting edge. It has VGA, DVI, multiple component inputs, and a single HDMI port. It is not a \"smart TV\", because back then they didn't exist! But it has served me very well for watching sports, Blu-rays and playing videogames. It is also flanked by very high quality speakers--so good that I simply stopped using my 5.1 system because it wasn't worth it!The only drawback, in my opinion, is also one of the benefits. That sounds odd, but I'm speaking of the pedestal. If your system and area you'll have your TV in can accommodate the footprint of the pedestal, it's very convenient to have it so that you don't have to worry about buying a shelving unit or hanging it on the wall as you do with a flat TV. However, if you don't have space for it, that can be a problem. Make sure you have a good space for a TV like this.Anyway, even nearly a decade later, I still think this is a great TV. I just recently replaced the bulb and the picture is crisp and bright--I love it! I don't feel like they make 'em like this anymore. It feels like consumer electronics and TVs in general are not built to last this long these days. It's unfortunate, but makes me all the happier to own this model.","Date":"March 17, 2013"}

They all suffer from chromatic aberration:  whenever there is a high-contrast object on the screen (e.g., white letters on a dark background, such as displayed using an on-screen guide) there is a one-pixel-wide stripe of green on one side of the object, and a one-pixel-wide stripe of magenta (reddish) on the other.  Darth Vader has a halo when moving across a light background!!!If you don't mind spending upwards of $3k on a TV, and having such flaws, this TV is for you:  the HD is truly spectacular.  However, if you are one to \"tweak\" the settings on the TV to get the best picture possible, once you see this flaw, you won't be happy with the set.  The flaw was supposedly fixed in models made after August 2004, but the 3 December 2004's that I have had in my house all had this manufacturing flaw that can't be adjusted.  Of course, I know that the picture won't be \"perfect\" on any TV set.  However, this is not seen in other technologies (JVC is LCOS-based).HD material is truly awesome on this picture, except for the flaw.  If it is something you don't notice, then I recommend this TV.  If you are a discriminating TV viewer, and are concerned about such things as black levels and true color reproduction (all technologies have plus's and minus's in these categories), then this flaw will not be something you can live with.","Date":"February 2, 2005"}

I play many PS3 games on it and watch HD movies like crazy. The picture is outstanding. I want to upgrade to a 1080P tv, however this thing keeps kicking, and I honestly can't picture a tv looking better. Maybe side by side I'd see the difference, however in my home it looks flawless. I even got the swivel stand made by JVC so I can easily face the tv towards my dining room when it's time to eat.  A couple pointers for those of you with bulb issues.  -Never turn the tv off by a switch or unplugging it. Always allow it proper shutdown time so that the bulb can be cooled off by a fan.  -Keep the tv at least 2-3 feet from the wall behind it. This allows proper air flow to keep the bulb cool, and makes it less likely for a dusty build up.  -DUST!! Dont let dust sit on your screen, or on the back. This will clog up the air vents, causing the bulb to get very hot and blow.  -Don't constantly turn your tv on and off. Repeatedly doing this will also shorten the life of the tv. Just like a regular bulb!I have more than gotten my moneys worth, and would gladly buy this tv again. Thanks JVC!!","Date":"June 2, 2010"}

The picture is still perfect and it is still more than capable of displaying the HD content given from any cable provider.However, because its 720P it can not display the full resolution of Blu-Ray... but that doesn't matter because unless you have superhuman vision you absolutely can not tell the difference at 10 feet away.  Honestly, I can't tell the difference at even 4' away, but like most people I don't have 100% perfect vision.  20/20 only indicates how sharp or clear your vision is at a distance.

The shopping and selection process for this was long and hard, and the high end of our budget range certainly included some plasmas and flat panel LCDs near (but mostly above) the price of this TV.If you are a technology consumer, you know the deal: early adopters of LCD and plasmas are going to take a beating as prices for these fall. These technologies are not yet mature, and there are lingering issues, such as burn-in with plasma, and the sheer expense of LCDs. This set offers an excellent value for the size while the super thin formats settle in the marketplace.The picture is astonishing, and even more if you are lucky enough to live in an area served by HDTV. Even though not a true flat panel, it is only 15 inches deep and weighs less than 60 pounds. Getting it where you want to sit will probably take two people, but once there, it can be moved for cabling access easily by one person.It has more input options than most of us could ever afford to populate.Its user guide is complete and clearly written. I give only a B+ to some of the on-screen menu options; not all of them are immediately intuitive.

It is, hands down, the absolute best value for the money I could find.PICTURE CLARITYThe HDTV quality is simply amazing, even breathtaking. I have found myself watching 2-hour documentaries about the now defunct whaling industry in Croatia just for the fact that is was broadcast in HDTV. DVD quality is also quite good, and regular digital cable is also rather sharp (and while analog signals will be tolerable, they pale in comparison to the others). Video games are as crisp as they could be, and the television also works great as a secondary monitor (invest in a TV-out video card and a wireless keyboard/mouse, and your couch is now your new home office).LCD TVs still have some minor issues with either incredibly rapid movement and/or bright flashes of light. There is a small distortion; a pixilation that will briefly flash across the screen but it is at best a minor annoyance. Also, the blacks are not as black as they could/should be, so if you are watching a movie or program where the setting is very dark, there will be a slight glow around the black areas that can be a little annoying.The short of it is this; if you are in any way normal, you will be blown away by the clarity and intensity of the images this set can produce. If you are a TV snob (and you know who you are), and could rant for ten minutes about the red push, or how optical audio out only passes digital signals via the tuner, then you may have a few complaints. The rest of us will be quite happy.PICTURE CLAIRITY RUNDOWN:HDTV: Aside from the above mentioned black levels, flawless, crisp and shockingly bright.DVD: Good picture, though not quite as good as I expected. Animated/Digitally generated DVD (think Shrek) are nearly as good as HDTV. I suspect this has to do with the set being an LCD projector.Digital Cable: Average to good, depending on channel, but most fall within the good range (Note: This is based on Comcast digital cable service in Washington DC).Regular Cable: N/A (I don't have it, so I don't know)Video Games: Sharp, crisp, and oh-so big. Very Good. (Note: Based on a first gen Sony PS2)Computer Monitor: Another task that I suspected would be a major hassle that actually went off with little incident was adding a TV out video card to my PC and hooking it directly to my Sony. The picture and resolution are flawless, and with a wireless mouse and keyboard, my sofa has become an extension of my home office.SOUNDIts...well, its actually not too bad, to be honest. I expected it to be crap, and compared to any decent surround-sound system it does seem rather anemic, but all in all they are quite good, and the audio options are numerous. I sill suggest a decent surround sound system, but you can live without it.EASE OF USEI think out of everything, this surprised me the most. I had purchased a new all-in-one Sony surround sound/DVD player with the television, and had my digital/HDTV cable box delivered a day before. I now had the daunting task of trying to coble all of this together.I won't lie about this; I was scared. The TV I had before this one was a 27\" GE that I first purchased when I joined the Navy, and the only input it had was a singular hookup for coaxial cable.To my surprise (and everlasting gratitude) It was amazingly easy. Three cables is all that it took (four if you count the Playstation), and it worked like a charm the first time around. Also here are 8 video input channels for this television, so I can't imagine I would ever run out of room for more devices.One note on this: With a set this good, and assuming you plan to hook it up to a 5.1 surround sound system, it is going to cost you about 300 bucks for new wires and a decent surge protector. Factor that into your final cost for this big-ticket item.","Date":"March 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great TV for half plasma price","Author":"Czar Paul","ReviewID":"R3SSBZAP1E7ZTZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Considering the price, this tv is a great value. I've been waiting for prices to come down and made the purchase soon after this model came out. There are multiple connections of all types including the cable card slot, which lets you get HDTV from your cable company without a set top box. The only drawback to this is that you don't get the program guide or any interactive features (program guide, PPV) with this feature. Hooked up to a HDTV signal, the picture is incredible. Football is super clear, and movies from HBO etc in HD also look great. Hook up a progressive scan DVD player and the picture is fantastic. The speakers are very good. Only drawback is that like any projection TV, there is an optimal viewing angle. You will notice a dimming of the picture as you move around.  When you see this TV, it's best to view it at an angle that you will be seeing it at home, even if that means looking silly in the showroom by crouching down when you look at it. Also be aware that you will have to replace the bulb on this type of tv as it ages.Added 2/08 To clarify my point about the picture dimming as you move, I really meant that you need to look at the TV at the correct height. The picture is much different if you stand higher than it rather that look at it direct on. I have not noticed a problem in the side to side viewing angle. Sorry for any confusion. After 3 months, I still love this set.","Date":"November 28, 2004"}
{"Title":"Sincerely Satisfying TV, despite Pro Reviews","Author":"J. Cascio \"Professional Escapist\"","ReviewID":"R22EUWV21NJEEK","Overall":"good","Content":"After dedicating a room in my basement for a home theater, I subsequently spent many, many weeks laboring over what TV was best for my application. I looked at every RPTV & Plasma that was carried by both Big-Chain & Custom A/V stores. You just can't find Plasma in this price range that is comparable in size, resolution and picture quality. That left DLP & LCD RPTVs. The Sony LCD RPTV line definitely was superior to any other brand out there, (thanks to Sony's WEGA engine). The price was fair at $2200. The picture quality is breathtaking on HD, excellent with DVD, and surprisingly acceptable on standard cable-TV.The TV is used primarily for watching DVDs.A word of caution to those with smaller rooms who are particular about picture quality...don't over buy (size). The downfall of fixed-resolution TVs (LCD, DLP) is the inability to adapt lower res. sources like DVD...not too noticeable unless you're seated close to the TV...like in my room. The viewing distance was only going to be 7-8 ft. at best with a 10ft. wide room. After standing the same distance away from the showroom TVs as my room affords me, I decided Sony delivered far and above the most impressive picture, despite the Professional Reviews I had read online. I also down graded from a 50in. to a 42in. This gave a slightly better viewing experience for the aforementioned reasons. I highly recommend taking advantage of the HDMI capabilities and purchasing an up-scaling HDMI DVD player. Both Sony & Panasonic have decent models for under $300. I went with the Sony DVP-NS975V. Once again, not great reviews, but astounding difference in the DVD picture quality. Combining this set with the right DVD player & sound system will give you a truly satisfying HT experience, without leaving you wondering where all your hard earned money went. The TV is bright, so you get a great picture with the lights on & off. Black level is acceptable; only notice the typical LCD/Black-level issues when the room is completely dark. I am not bothered by this.Bottom Line:Menu interface is intuitive.Picture presets are great and easy to customize, if needed.Sound is good, but if you're serious about the experience, you'll have an SS system.Picture quality is very impressive.Set dimensions are small, light and affordable compared to other LCD/DLP sets.Compared to other LCD/DLP sets, this is a 10. I gave it a nine overall because current fixed resolution TVs have inherent issues, (screen door/black-level,DLP-rainbow effect,etc.), that stop them from being perfect. But this one is pretty close.I just can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this set.","Date":"June 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best Picture on the Market","Author":"Ground Pounder \"Semper Fi\"","ReviewID":"R2B68YFOUYUEYL","Overall":"good","Content":"I looked at *many* televisions before buying this one.  While I was initially attracted to DLP projections (I am not impressed with the plasmas on the market), this Sony LCD projection caught my eye from all the way across the store.  It converts all signals to 720p, so you will see improvement even from standard (480i) signals.  With its built-in tuner, you'll be able to pull in HD signals as soon as you get home with only an antenna (the Zenith/Gemini ZHDTV1 is what I would recommend).  Having this television for the college bowl season was one of the happiest parts of my holiday, as I get all the local networks' digital broadcasts with my antenna (here's where 720p beats 1080i).  If you are a sports fan, you *need* an HDTV.There are numerous connections, including HDMI, and so far everything I have hooked up to this set looks amazing.  The settings menus are very easy to use, which is important since a little tweeking with the controls will ensure that each input performs at top quality.  One of the other reviewers suggested that the viewing angle is restrictive.  I could not disagree more: you basically have to be standing beside it or directly above for the picture to go dark.  I'd say the viewing angle is probably more than 150 degrees.In short, buy this set.  It is very affordable (less than half the price of a plasma the same size, with much better picture), has all of the bells and whistles (including a built-in HD tuner), and will look great in your living room.","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

An ideal choice if you want to watch HDTV & non-HDTV regular channels. The 42\" screen is small enough to retain clarity for regular channels and big enough for a regular sized living room. Make sure you have enough distance from TV, at least 10 feet. Some of the downsides are:1. The intensity of the rear projection lamp cannot be changed. It is sufficiently bright for any room but if you are very close to TV in a dark room it is uncomfortable.2. The TV has a fan inside that is noticeable occassionally at low volumes.Some Tips: The DVI-HDMI connection somehow did not work with my HDTV cable box. Avoid paying the high price for this cable and go with regular component video cables (RGB). The picture is still crystal clear for HDTV channels.

{"Title":"I LOVE this televiosn!","Author":"Joseph P. Weber","ReviewID":"RPOQE4PVNKWQF","Overall":"good","Content":"Let's just say I was ready for a new TV.  The television in my living room was a 17 year old 36\" console televsion that had the tendancy to keep turning itself on and off after it had been on for over an hour.  I finally decided to break down and invest in a new quality television.  I first considered getting a plasma screen, but the based on the research I had done, I was not convinced that any added value a plasma screen may give you is worth the extremely higher price.  But this Sony WEGA LCD television is most definitely worth its price.Although not as narrow as a plasma screen television, at a mere 15\" in depth, even if space is a consideration, this television will not fail you.But it is the absolutely beautiful picture and incredibly crisp sound that are the true selling points for this TV.  The quality of the picture, even on the non-HDTV channels, is amazing.  I am still in awe of how much better the picture is now.  The quality of the HD channels absolutely blows me away.  While many shows on television aren't necessarily enhanced with HD programming (for instance, do you really need to see \"Judging Amy\" in pure digital, picture perfect quality?), but on certain programming such as sports or shows that have scenic backgrounds such as \"Lost,\" it is so amazing to see how beautiful they look on this television, I am probably too spoiled now to see them on any other television!I am also blown away with the stunning performance the television gives when playing DVDs.  I recommend getting the upgraded cables to connect your DVD player to the television.  But in any event, digital is what this TV was made for, and it is clear when playing DVDs.  Given the size of the screen and the quality of the picture, it is akin to actually being in the theater.The quality of the sound is also up to the standard you expect from Sony.  I do not yet have the television hooked up to any external speakers or any surround sound system, but instead rely only on the internal speakers.  Nonetheless, the sound is still perfect.  I am not a fan of watching of channels such as MTV, VH1, or the like, so cannot really speak as to how the sound system is on channels that are more sound reliant.  But you will not be disappointed with the sound on all the other channels.The added functions and features with the television are also quite impressive.  The picture-in-picture function is great, particularly if you like watching sports and can have a game on the smaller screen and watch regular programming on the main screen and click back and forth when something big happens in the game.  (I recently switched from cable to satellite -- a switch a highly recommend for everyone -- and have not figured out how, if at all, the picture-in-picture feature will work with satellite.)In short, I LOVE this television.  I am confident you will too.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

{"Title":"This TV will most likely fail due to design flaw; Sony is no help.","Author":"Aidan D. Dunne \"Oh no, not again.\"","ReviewID":"RIBAN1TBOAWX4","Overall":"bad","Content":"Before you buy this set, search online for :\"Sony optical block problems\"Bought this set in 2004. March 2009 I notice a blue haze at the bottom of the screen. After some research I discovered that  this is a very common problem and is essentially a flaw with the design that runs throughout the range of Sony Grand Wega sets;Specifically, failing optical blocks ultimately make the set unusable, due to artifacts of many different hues and sizes to appear on your screen.Repair runs to the order of $1000. I contacted Sony and thought that I would get this resolved as they admit that this problem is known and they indicate on their website page detailing the problem that they are resolute in their desire to maintain high quality, blah, blah etc.On my first point of contact I indicated that I did not want to foot the bill. The Sony service rep mumbled \" oh yes sir, I fully understand...\".. eh?I contacted a service center, and described the problem. I had to contact Sony again  to verify something so this time  I asked directly if  Sony would pay for it.The rep said the warranty had expired, and that the limited extended warranty that Sony put in place specifically to cover this *known* flaw had also expired, so the repair would be at my expense.Hmmm, so they know that they have a pandemic-sized problem that shows up only after a while for which they provide a limited window of support, then close up shop leaving many of their customers with junk too costly to repair.Even if you repair it, I understand that the design is such that the proximity of the lamp to the block is likely to again degrade the replacement part over time.Anyways, I indicated my displeasure to the rep, pointing out that the number of people being affected by this is fast approaching one that simply can't be ignored, and that I would be adding my voice and review-writing time to the clamor.In fairness to the poor, powerless guy on the phone, he did register my complaint, but I would be surprised if it will go anywhere.. if it does, then I'll repost here.So at this point I'm left with limited options other than to get loud enough for them to consider me a pest..I hate doing this because I have a life to live and work to do, and I really like to come away with  nice fuzzy feelings about customer service ( check out Oppo for a great electronics company that knows how to make you happy).Oh well.. off I go to cnet now...then maybe avsforum, and highdefforum.. oh the list is endless..","Date":"March 27, 2009"}
{"Title":"Amazing HD Picture, lot of inputs, built in digital tuner..","Author":"Manish Pandit","ReviewID":"R3MCLGSZBTVZWK","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV in January from the local GoodGuys store. I needed a bigscreen without a lot of weight, and did not want to go with a plasma given the burnout concerns. LCD rear projection fit my budget and my apartment, and I am happy with my purchase. I did get the store warranty, just in case!I have limited basic comcast BUT was shocked to see the TV picking up HD channels right out of the cable! I do not have a comcast cable box but the built in digital tuner did the magic. So I am enjoying about 10 HD channels with no cable box to add to the clutter. Picture quality is amazing! There are lots of inputs. I have connected its audio to Onkyo HT770 home theater via an optical cable. I have also managed to connect my computer to the TV via S-Video, since the HDMi input didnt work great for me - I had to get a DVi-HDMi cable ($120) but still I could not get resolutions more than 640x480. I have given up on that. Other than that, DVDs are rendered in progressive @480p with my Sony DVD player. The quality is good enough for me, to not think about going with an upconverter.The only thing I do not like about it is the lag between turning it on and picture showing up (about 10 seconds). There were some postings on the internet about the lamp life, but I believe those were earlier models. Also, the remote does not allow switching to an input directly (It has 7 video inputs). If I have to reach Video IN #5, I have to browse all the way from Video1. Maybe I need to read the manual real closely.Overall, good bang for your buck and an excellent candidate for a Home Theater hookup. However, I never had good luck making an HTPC out of it. SD channels do look a bit strange but acceptable. With the right set up, this TV can really turn your living room into a personal movie theater..for me it did!","Date":"February 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"Major Leap Forward in TV Tech","Author":"B. Johnson \"BJ\"","ReviewID":"R1E2F9HYHD4P8M","Overall":"good","Content":"After 23 years with a conventional NTSC t.v. we decided to  jump to HD digital. We started reviewing sets about three years ago and found the technology immature, outlandishly priced and dealer information usually wrong. While DLP works well for video presentation projectors, you need a two or three chip set to do away with picture lag, and pictures look pixellated. Hitachi has already announced they are dropping DLP technology. Plasmas STILL suffer problems with burn-in even with picture-shift technology, they often die in 3 or 4 years, can be noisy especially above 4,000' altitude, and are fragile. Gas is gas and it leaks, degrades, has a half-life and despite urban legend gas in plasma tvs cannot be replaced. Dealers lie constantly--one told us that Plasmas now last 16 years!On to the Sony 42we655. Settling on Sony was a leap of faith. Our last experience with Sony equipment, an amp, was not a good one; quality control dropped since the 1970s when Sony was king and we had been buying Panasonic.  However, the built in featurs on this LCD TV especially the integrated NTSC and ATSC tuners and cable card slot cinched it. Prices vary wildly on the Net, but once you factor in shipping they all come out to about $2,100 to $2,500. The competing units are cheaper, but have no tuners,so add $300.We elected to buy it from Circuit City to avoid shipping costs and drop-kicks by shippers. CC is having financial difficulties, so we declined the extended CC-backed warranty in case they crater in competition with Best Buy.The unit took all of 20 mnutes to set up with no technical knowledge necessary. Don't let the CC delivery crew cable it to amps and DVDs because they don't know your equipment. Reading the manual first is a must because the unit is technologically advanced, but well worth it. Plan to spend several nights learning how to operate it and refining the adjustments. If you don't want to do this, turn it over to a spouse, geek friend or teenager.The picture quality is outstanding, and we get amazing HD signals with a set of rabbit ears in a rural area! Don't fret about the bulb, changing it is about 5 minutes work --no harder than an LCD projector bulb. A word about DVD connections, don't try to run a one-cable composite video feed from a DVD---spend the $40 and get component cables which give a much better picture. DVD quality differs wildly, so don't judge the set until you look at several different DVDs. Some writers have remarked about blacks. Yes, high CGI (computer graphic) special effects movies are dark, even in the theaters. CGI looks bad in sunlight which is why the movis are set at night. Video tape signals are amazingly bad because of the quality, so don't blame the set---just get rid of or transfer your old tapes and go to DVD.A great tv that you will enjoy exploring.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}

Cranford \"JMC\"","ReviewID":"R2PFBUIU8VJ4BU","Overall":"good","Content":"As others have mentioned, I researched several TVs and their technologies before settling on the Sony 42\" LCD Projection HDTV.  I'm pleased.  Even with the wide screen, the TV isn't too large and doesn't take up much space.  It's not heavy either.Very nice picture.  Standard definition programming is unremarkable, but HD content is spectacular.  I went with the 42\" because the larger screens aren't quite as bright considering that they all use the same high intensity bulb.  It's more screen to illuminate.  The 42\" screen was more than adequate.  Huge in fact.Even though I have the sound running through a six speaker Sony Dream home theater system, the TV's sound is very nice.  Unless you're wanting the booming vibration of a subwoofer, the TV's speakers are fine for everyday viewing and listening.Of all the reputable retailers, Amazon.com has the best price by far.  I looked at Sears, Circuit City, Best Buy, and other online retailers.  I decided to go with Amazon because of reputation, lower price, and shipping costs.  I found this TV for a little cheaper online from unknown retailers, but the trust factor led me back to Amazon.The shipping process was wonderful.  Arrived in about a week.  EagleGL was the carrier.  The guy called me on my cell a few minutes before he pulled up to the house.  I met him there.

No problems whatsoever.  Obviously this model is only 1080i but that is the best you can get with most cable and dish services anyway.=================I've had this unit for a few weeks now.  It is unbelievable!  The picture quality in HD and viewing DVD's is incredible.The only frustration I have and this goes for ALL Sony products is the manual.  Their products are outstanding but the manuals that accompany them are very difficult to decipher unless you are a true audiophile.  After a few hours of tinkering around though I was able to get it all hooked up and the next day when my cable guy came out to install the HD box he made a few adjustments that got everything working.My suggestion: If you are going to make this type of an investment including home audio and video equipment, spend a few hundred dollars extra and have a professional come out and hook it up.  I didn't do this but in hindsight I think it would have been worth it.Once it's all hooked up and working the way you want it you won't believe the oooh's and aaah's you will get from this thing.

But now, it is lucky to get 2 stars.  The reliability of ALL rear projection HDTVs are poor at best.  BEWARE !!!!  This also comes from Consumer Reports.  Go to their website to get their exact statement.I have had the product for almost 2 years.  It has never been problem free.  From day 1, I have had a ripple in the picture right at the center of the screen for all high definition channels.  I do believe it is due to a compatability problem with the Directv satellite receiver and the TV.  In my opinion, Sony is still partly to blame.  Neither Sony, nor RCA care to help me try to resolve the issue, so I just lived with it.  It is a small issue to some, but not me.As of 3 weeks ago, I started to see a couple of blue dots on the screen that were permanent.  I contacted Sony, and they said it is a natural characteristic of the LCD image and should not take away from my viewing experience.  Well, as of last night, I counted 98 pyxles that have nothing but a blue color all the time.  This is taking away from my viewing experience !!!  It has taken me 3 weeks (with Sony's help) to find someone who will service the thing.

{"Title":"Great HD quality, disappointing SD quality","Author":"Dan Liebgold","ReviewID":"R27G1Q7P2D5JC7","Overall":"good","Content":"The good news is the TV is user friendly and worked perfectly for everything we tried right away. It found over the air digital channels (some in HD) and all the inputs worked as advertised.The bad news is the standard definition image quality is a big disappointment compared to the trinitron tube I was used to! Maybe this won't be a surprise to others but it was to me. Even watching digital channels and using s-video or component inputs, the image is evidently not scaling up very well. This maybe has to do with the native resolution of the display (1386 x 788) and the way the image is scaled up. I'm guessing that SD images don't align with the native pixels no matter what the TV circuitry does. The pixels bleed noticeably and text edges are doubled when they should be crisp.Something else to get used to (really I can't decide if its worse or just different) is the 'glare' of this backlit set. The TV uses a bright lamp to back-light the LCD, and for images with light colors the glare can be hard on the eyes. This may be a matter of taste, but it is something to get used to.The one bright spot of hope is the digital HD image quality. Once tuned to a real HD digital signal, the TV begins to really shine. Even without an HD signal you can see the potential in the on-screen menus. Suddenly there are no scaling artifacts, the pixels are crisp and clear, and even the brightness and colors are more even and less eye-tiring. I dread going back to a non HD signal.So if you are upgrading step by step, be prepared for a new-found motivation to upgrade all available equipment to make sure you are in HD land as much as possible. Digital HD cable, DirectTV HD, and over the air digital HD are your friends. ReplayTV, DVDs, and standard channels will get more tiresome with this TV.","Date":"June 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great TV","Author":"Kyle D. Gendron","ReviewID":"R19S2MBBIVQASA","Overall":"good","Content":"We have needed a new TV to replace the 32\" Sony I bought in 1995. I researched for months. For the longest time I was leaning towards a 34\" tube model. Then I found this set coming down in price at various web sites. I check it out in person in a few different stores and really liked the picture.I finally made the purchase in Mid August at a high-end TV store. Got it as a floor model at about $600 of list price. Could pass up the deal.At first I found the standard digital channels (on Comcast digital) were really not very clear. Then we ended up having an issue with the cable box and not getting channels. Comcast came by and found we had to many splitters coming off our main cable feed. (We have 2 digital cable boxes, 2 HDTV boxes and 1 line for broadband internet) The cable guy took away a few of the 2 way splitters and converted to 4 way splitters and also added an amplifier.Since then the non-HD channels are coming in much better. Still not quite as good as on the old TV or on the 34\" HD tube TV we have, but much better than it was.As for the HD channels themselves: When the broadcast is in HD, the picture is AWESOME! Especially Discovery HD, ESPN HD and all the NFL games broadcast in HD. I love this TV.The 42\" size is big, but not out of control. Right now we are watching from about 10' away.One of the things I like best is the picture in picture. It's a side by side picture. You can have both screen's the same size or make one bigger. I believe there are 3 or 4 different setting for size. Great when watching 2 NFL games on Sundays or you want to watch the football game and baseball game at the same time. When both screens are the same size, its like watching 2 20\" TV next to each other.DVD's are also great with this TV. I have the cable hooked up via the HDMI and the DVD with the composite video.

{"Title":"Great for about 18 months, then screen went blotchy","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R1RTHQY8AXSBH7","Overall":"bad","Content":"For about a year and a half this TV performed very well.  It had a crisp, brilliant picture and more than justified the cost.  Then blue blotches started to appear on the screen.  I checked the Sony service website, which said that that there would be extended coverage for problems with a blotchy picture, but only certain *kinds* of blotches.There are apparently two design defects with this unit.  The first defect has something to do with a defect in the LCD array itself, which caused picture elements to bleed into each other, and the second defect is that the sealing fails on the image box, allowing dust into the unit where it bonds with the LCD and creates a blotchy effect.The first defect (I'm told) is covered by Sony extended warranty.  The second is not.  After paying $100 for an \"evaluation\" which took less than a minute, we were told that the issue with our TV was not covered.  We were then given an estimate to fix the unit that was slightly more than the cost to replace it with a better TV.If I'm reading the Sony service notice correctly, the image box problems apply to all Sony Grand WEGA televisions, so I'd have to recommend that you avoid any of this line of TVs.What's more upsetting is Sony's refusal to own up to what is clearly a design defect in these units.  Anyone can make a mistake, but the real test of a company's ethics is how they deal with it, and Sony seems to have really dropped the ball on this one.We were early adopters of many Sony products -- the Beta video format, the Sony Discman, (I still have a D7 and it still works) the 8mm format, memory stick devices, the Sony XBR line of televisions, and Sony stereo components.  At $2,499, this TV was the biggest ticket item we have ever purchased from Sony, and they let us down.  Perhaps Sony is not the company they used to be.We are currently looking for a replacement TV, but we are not considering Sony, as it would be financially irresponsible to throw good money after bad.The other thing that bothers me is that this 18-month-old TV, being junk, not worth fixing, is destined to become landfill, along with countless other Sony Grand WEGA televisions that died long before expected, are not covered and cost more to fix than to replace.  That is very unfortunate.","Date":"June 22, 2008"}

(Mfr'd Sep '04)  We loved it at first and would have gladly given it a 5 star rating.  We were warned that we'd have to replace the bulb about once a year (costing roughly $100) and we did.  In September 2006 we noticed a faint blue cloud appearing in the center of the screen that measured about 8\"x8\".  Over the next couple months the blue cloud became more intense and then a blue line about an inch thick permanently formed horizontally across the bottom of the screen and now there is also a blue triangle to the bottom right of the screen that goes up about 10\".  It is very annoying and whenever we have company over we have to explain that it is the tv, not the channel.  We called in a very reputable tv repair service to look at it and much to our surprise he told us it was the 'optic device' and to replace it would cost about $1,000.00.  What!  We could buy another tv just like this for a couple hundred more.  We're very surprised that with the reputation Sony has that this tv would only last us 2 years and 2 months.

{"Title":"A great TV for the money","Author":"Trivia Master","ReviewID":"R25YHHFDPQT1KD","Overall":"good","Content":"After doing a vast amount of research, I came to the conclusion that the Sony was one of the best bargains that I saw. I gave it a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the fact that the daytime viewing is NOT as clear and detailed as my other Sony; A 36XBR250 VEGA without HD. Actually, some of the standard displays on the older Sony are better than the LCD. I am probably going to get an upscaler to match the display to the best that it can do. As far as using the remote, I set all the inputs to video 5 and play them through my Denon 3803 receiver. I also have a Pioneer Elite laser, Panasonic DVD RP91 and a Pioneer 563A. I feel that the upscaler would take the place of much higher equipment. I can't wait for the NEW 1920 X 1024 displays which are coming in 3-4 years. By then, I will tire of the LCD and go with a plasma or projection. I DID get the warranty, as the price of the bulb is included and 1 thing wrong makes up the difference. My price at Good Guys was $2149.00, + tax, $399.00 for 5 year warranty, $299.00 for set up that took 5 hours and included wiring for 7 different items. The next $ amount spent will be on a certified calibration for the BEST picture..GREAT TV!!!!","Date":"February 28, 2005"}

If you HAVE A 2004 model of several of these tv models they will fix the optical block and repair free of cost.  I'm not sure if they'll cover the diagnosis but its on sony's website.[...]As technology evolves, Sony continually looks to stand behind the reliability of its televisions. It has come to our attention that a limited number of Grand WEGA rear projection televisions (models listed above), after a period of time, exhibit blue dot or star pattern on the screen.In addition, for any customer who later experiences this issue on one of the affected models, Sony will cover the cost of the optical block repair (parts and labor) at no charge through December 31, 2008. All other terms of the Sony limited warranty continue to apply. Sony utilizes a network of hundreds of qualified independent third-party servicers to perform in-home television warranty service. Sony, through its authorized service network, will endeavor to repair your set within 30 days of your first contact. For diagnosis, warranty service, or if you are not provided a repair within 30 days, please contact Sony at (888) 649-7669.Update: 6/6/2009As I originally wrote this posting- my tv was fixed but from what i remember the due date to get it fixed for FREE was before December 2008. I had mine fixed in November. When you called customer service you have to tell them exactly what is happening and just like the sony posting says. It is blue spots all over the screen and it's the optical block. The repair people called me and they came fixed it for free in 2 days. With Sony Customer Service you have TO SAY EXACTLY HOW IT INDICATED ON THEIR WEBSITE and show that you know what you were talking about. It was right on their website along with pictures. THEY SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED WILL BE CORRECTED FOR FREE AND NEW OPTICAL BLOCK INSTALLED. Usually the optical block is $850 and a new one made my scrreen scream like new again. My tv looks brand new but since we put many hours on it for years i noticed i'll be needing a new lams now which is why I'm searching for it now. Can't believe people having problems since it was no the sony site with pictures and all. I love the tv especially picture and sound.

{"Title":"Timing, timing, timing ..","Author":"pasent","ReviewID":"RDP90H7TG0L2Z","Overall":"bad","Content":"It is Oct 2009 and I have decided to take a few minutes to vent and share personal frustrations re my experience with Sony. I am feeling defeated from having spent countless hours on the ever popular 'blue haze/cloud/dot reality nightmare show' of my Sony KDL-42WE655 Projection TV screen which I purchased on sale for $2400 in Oct 2004. In this instance, my once 4 year extended warranty which I had purchased through Best Buy as insurance against unforeseen potential major repair issues such as this expired last Oct. I am informed the optical block/engine is leaking and needs replaced at a cost of approx $1100 of which is only a temporary fix to an ongoing defective problem. Sony's Extended Warranty Service terminated Dec 2008 for a KNOWN manufacturer flaw which was apparently posted on their website and communicated in writing via letter to all owners potentially affected - I personally did NOT receive the letter and found that curious? I have had much discussion with various people in the electronics field, service techs and have read countless blogs. So I contacted Sony in hopes of getting it fixed beyond their warranty deadline. Well, I was reminded many times that the warranty period ended; however, I persisted further and spoke with a supervisor who offered me a hint of hope(with no further negotiation I'm told) is as follows:(a) Sony to pay $300 toward the repair only after I show proof via diagnostics from an authorized Sony Service Center which is 1/2 of the $300 already but can be applied toward the repair -OR- (b) Sony to give me a discount toward a new Sony TV - minimal it is and from a TV of their choice delivered to me by truck. This second option is not without a small catch attached as I must physically remove the serial number (tab) off the back of my current TV and send it to them to get the 'deal' and by doing so it would take my TV out-of-service obviously restricting me from getting it repaired on my own - well, I don't think so! I currently have no plans. I encourage any response to this matter from anyone having current knowledge, experience (positive or negative) and/or thoughts or suggestions on how or if I should proceed further. Their 1/4 offer of the cost of the repair just doesn't sit well with me and I think that is their aim to get me to bite the bullet. Truthfully, I am sick of it but there is a principal here and I have read about Sony being in Litigation regarding this very issue. So for now I am going to sit tight and keep my ears and eyes open. I believe there may be further recourse but not sure I want to hassle with it. Sony has marked my file and is awaiting a response from me - don't know of a timeline (if any) on this.Over the years I have purchased Sony TV's having been the best of the best. This experience has left me numb and when it comes to Sony expressing how they stand behind their products well, maybe in lip service! I want action and fairness and still want this matter resolved. TIMING is everything.. IF only I had received that letter.. IF the blue haze/cloud/dots on the screen had ONLY been more visable sooner.. guess I'm a little late, so they say. Timing, timing, timing. IF Sony would just make exception here and extend a warranty that they already extended due to an admitted error/defect? C'mon!","Date":"October 6, 2009"}

We contacted Sony and after a very lengthy process they agreed to pay for parts and we paid for labor. The repair shop replaced the optical assembly ($800) while we paid the labor ($300).  However, the replacement optical assembly is not color balanced.  It produces a distinct redish tone on the left side and a bluish tone on the right. This was confirmed with using a Minolta CS100 Colorimeter  The repair shop said that was the best they could do.  Bottom line: this is a great TV when it works properly,  but get an extended warranty as LCD rear projection technology does not have the reliability of a CRT.  Finally  consider other manufactures. Whenever we shopped for a TV, video camera, etc. we only bought Sony. However, after this experience Sony should no longer receive a free pass on quality.","Date":"May 21, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great for the first 2 years, but then.....","Author":"A. Burns","ReviewID":"R25I3R108XZL12","Overall":"bad","Content":"This TV was great for the first two years.  Other people with HDTV's often commented how much better my picture was than theirs.  I loved this TV.  But now, after having it 2 1/2 years, it turned itself off and the red LED flashes in bursts of 7 times.  I found out that is a malfunctioning D board and is a common problem.  Scheduling the service with Sony has not been fun and they say the product is on backorder and don't know when it will be in.  I've found it on a website and am going to order it and hope I can get technician out.  But seriously, when you spend $2300 on a TV you should not have problems with it this soon.  If it were a fluke, fine, but so many people have had the problem they're running out of parts.","Date":"November 19, 2007"}

For the 1st 2years and four months it was fantastic view, but now I'm told it needs an optical block which I paid 99.00 to find out through sony who said if it was road mapping or lines it would be free diagnostics and under recall for the optical block.  But they said it's caused by dust on my optical block so they cannot replace it under warranty because its not scribble lines or roadmapping and it would run 1200.00 to replace.  Thank God I bought the extended warranty.  It's extremely disappointing to know you are a loyal sony cust. and they don't stand behind their product that we spent 3300.00 on? and the real shame it IS the recall part that IS causing the concern.

It sounds like my only shot at getting this fixed will cost me over $1000.  I can't believe Sony isn't doing a recall on this.

{"Title":"What does an LCD HD monitor look like without HD signals...","Author":"W. Wu \"WWW\"","ReviewID":"RWF4OJGXSL8IP","Overall":"good","Content":"I'd like to start this review with a disclaimer.  I am very happy with the TV.  It works exactly the way it's supposed to.  Problem is, nobody who sells the thing tells you how it's SUPPOSED to work.When you are looking at these things in the store, notice that there is always a DVD playing, or they have the set turned to Discovery HD Theater.  There is a reason for this.  An LCD HD monitor that is showing a regular (I think analog) or even a digital signal will not show well.  The picture quality is lower than that of a regular CRT TV in these cases due to the extreme pixelation of the image.However, if you position the TV correctly in your viewing space, some of this will be aleviated.  For a 50 inch TV, you should sit back between 10-15 feet from the screen.  From that far, you really won't see the pixels, so it won't bother you.  (You can definitely tell the difference between HD and non-HD from this disctance still).  This viewing disctance is what the manufacturers tell you to do.  Do not buy this TV and sit 8 feet away and expect to be happy with it.I say all this not to harp on Sony.  THEIR PRODUCT WORKS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S LCD!!!  You should know this because currenlty only 10-15 channels are broadcast in HD depending on your vendor and region.  Therefore - if you have 150 channels, 90% will not be in HD, so the majority of your viewing will be pixelated.OK - all that said - it's a great TV.  All the pro's have already been discussed - so I won't go there.","Date":"January 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Excellent picture in every way except black level and 480p","Author":"J. Demmon","ReviewID":"R1QZC63MNTUOAY","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is capable of astounding IMAX-like pictures when viewing a good HDTV signal.  Has very good 480i/NTSC up-conversion but only so-so at 480p.  That's because the advanced video processing menu option is only available for 480i and NTSC, not 480p (progressive).  As a consequence the TV does a really amazing job at up-converting ordinary analog tv signals and 480i DVD output.  But 480p component/DVI DVD is NOT as good as 480i component DVD, at least with my Denon 1910.  The sony's 480i up-converter even has an edge over the Denon's 720p and 1080i internal DVI up-converters.  Too bad you can't get 480i over DVI.As others have noted, black level is mediocre.  The screen puts out a glow during dark scenes that can't be adjusted away.  You don't really notice it in a brightly lit room.  But in a dark room it is very much apparent.  Before buying, judge for yourself by playing Harry Potter 3 or other dark movie in a dark room.  Turning on the DVD player's black level boost can help separate dark scenes from the background glow without compromising normally lit scenes.After about a month, I got use to the glow and don't really notice it except during extended, very dark scenes.","Date":"December 4, 2004"}
{"Title":"Incredible picture","Author":"Thomas B. Cass","ReviewID":"RL3IOJXQEW9KW","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the best 50\" I've seen at any price. A previous reviewer complained that the bulb blew after 30 min. Well, This happens sometimes. I've had light bulbs blow that fast. All he had to do was go to Circuit City and get another. He then could have installed it himself, an easy chore. To return a TV because the bulb went is simply foolish.Update:I wrote the above based on what I saw in the store. I now have had this TV for one week and Still think it's great. This tv converts standard signals to HDTV like resolution which works very well. The standard signals are the best I've ever seen, very HDTV like. Some people complain that LCD TV's don't produce deep blacks well. This may bother some but I don't notice it at all. The TV, while not flat, is only 17\" thick and weighs only 83 lbs. It has built in hand holds so 2 people han easily pick it up and carry it around. It has more inputs than I'll ever need (8 components). Thre are optical and coaxial digital outs for surround sound. I couldn't be more satisfied. For $2700 at Circuit City I consider this a bargain.Update 2:Sept 30 2005, After 10 months no change of opinion. We watch the TV every day. No problems at all. Still a great picture.Update 3July 4 2011. I upgraded this TV for an LCD flat screen and gave it to my daughter. It is still in daily use with only one bulb replacement. If you can find one used cheap I recommend it.","Date":"November 29, 2004"}

Black is not absolute, which is typical for an LCD TV. Black is dark enough however that it really is not a factor.When you get used to HDTV you really notice how low quality a standard broadcast is. I am using a DirecTV HD receiver for all channels including local. I do not get cable or HD good local reception where I am. I can not comment about off air TV quality.I chose an LCD based product because I could see the rainbow on some DLP based products. There is also a squeal audible (color wheel?) with some DLP products. I chose the Sony because it does not give much of a \"screen door\" appearance as some other LCD projectors do.If using a home theatre or surround sound receiver for your audio be sure to get a \"fast\" TV like this one. On some TVs the video processor is slow enough that you get sound and video out of sync. This TV does not suffer from such a video delay.","Date":"April 22, 2005"}
{"Title":"DONT BUY THESE TVS- RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS THEY DONT TELL YOU!!!","Author":"Always \"Truckin\"","ReviewID":"R24OPQP17JBEON","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this exact TV only a 60 inch in 2004 and that was the beginning of my troubles. Let me tell you why simply it is not cost effective to purchase this tv even if it is FREE: Dont do it. This is why.1. These are multiple class action law suits against Sony because all the LCDs they put out between 2003 to 2008 have bad parts, namely a big problem called the OPTICAL BLOCK. They new it and shipped them out anyway. It cost 1000 to 1500 to replace, but the kicker is all SONYs optical blocks for these TV are refurbished and subject to the same problems as the originals.2. Blue or Green or Yellow Dots or lines begin to appear on your TV until you cant see your picture anymore. THis is what happens when the OPTICAL Block goes on these TVs. After being sued so many times, sony stopped making these rear projection TVs. Go to Google or Yahoo and search this phrase, \"Blue dots on my sony lcd tv\". There is more information than you want to read and all of it make me mad I purchase my tv in 2004 for 3500 bucks.3. THey also dont tell you that every 1.5 years the picture lamp burns out and you have to replace it for a whooping 300 bucks a lamp. What a joke. I have have had to replace my 3 times. Sony says, well you watch the TV to much. The lamp is only designed to accomdate 10,000 hrs of viewing or whatever they said. But 300 bucks every 1.5 years is BS.4. The picture sucks if you are not watching a HD Station or a movie. It is unreal how grainy and what this TV looks like when you get it home. Night and day.DONT BUY THIS TV. DONT DO IT EVEN FOR FREE. CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF ON WEB AND SONY KNEW ALL ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS BUT COVERED THEM UP. These Tvs have so many problems the people selling their used TVs are the ones that SONY wheeled and dealed with. THey told me because they recongize their problem they would give me 50 percent off another Sony TV. NOT!!!!!I would not sell this TV to anyone without telling them what they are getting into.

{"Title":"samsung versus sony","Author":"M. Hoffman","ReviewID":"R1HEU9OM1UX5EX","Overall":"good","Content":"I owned the samsung 42\" dlp before this unit.  The samsung service was INCREDIBLY bad--it couldn't be any better than what is described in other reviews.  I had innumerable problems with this TV, including service calls, washed out images, and total failure.  I finally got them to give me \"permission\" to trade this in for the sony.  This product is far superior.  However, do yourself a favor and get a calibration disc.  This will improve the picture immeasurably.  If you are going to spend big bucks on a tv, pay the money to get the dark/light and color in focus.  How can others complain about the \"black,\" if they haven't had it professionally calibrated?  Playing with the tv menu and complaining is like changing the stations on your car radio and saying your engine now runs rough.  geez!My only complaint also concerns outputs which are limited as another person stated.  However, if you hook up inputs correctly, the output problem becomes mute.  I run a satellite receiver, DVD/VHS, 6 speakers (psb and paradigm) and audio receiver with this TV, so connections are a bit tricky.  I also wish that they had included the computer input which many other hdtv's have--however the price of this tv is somewhat lower than other 50\" so that trade-off seems understandable. For the money this is a great tv, and 50\" is a wonderful size for a larger living room.","Date":"April 20, 2005"}

I have been a audio/video engineer for 30 yrs. Here are my thoughts.I have 3 hi-quality LCD panels in my home, 32, 42, and 47\", blu-rays, 7.1, etc. I also have a 15K plus tube audio system here. I have experience with stuff.This panel honestly blew me away with the accurate color reproduction it offers. The best I have seen, and have seen Sony Broadcast monitors...you name it.Internal sound is good, but not using it. It feeds a 7.1 system in my secondary theater room {man cave}. This panel has never been in a smoking home.I read all the reviews I could find on this.Everyones eyes and ears are different.This panel had 11.5K hours on it via the accesible menu. The original owners I bought it from got it new in 2006. They NEVER did a thing to it, but were aware about how the bulb is supposed to be replaced after so many hours. SO I bought a new one for $61. Much cheaper now than years ago. I truly can not tell a difference between the new one and a 11.5K hr bulb. Incredible. I kept the old one for a spare.I realize this isn't the norm by my readings.I see no artifacts that make me feel the optical block has Any issues. HD signals look fabulous. I put in Wizard of OZ Blu-Ray and it is incredible. Again, color reproduction is A++ along with most all other aspects of video that can can be scrutinized. The ONLY thing I see as previously mentioned is about the black level on certain material.This panel, to me, offers one an analogish digital picture if you will, without digital artifacts.I really am happy. I got this panel on Craigslist when I was looking for a TV stand. I literally got the panel for free!Apparantly many of the panels have been plaged with problems. This one is a keeper. It blows away my other 1080p panels, and this is 1080i. EASY on the eyes, as my vinyl LP's are easy on the ears vs my tube digital system which is no slouch. Feed this panel a HD signal to enjoy what it can offer. 480 looks like any other panel with a 480 signal. Not enough info for a big picture. Why folks complain about 480 is because they are not knowledeable enough to know why standard definition looks only fair vs 1080. Something to Bit@^! about.I am enjoying this alot. I hope your panel is trouble free like this one. This is a new experience for an old gray haired engineer. If it ends up needing a optical block I will replace it...it's that good.I read, if you don't have major issues with this panel, and replace the lamp as needed life expectancy is 27 yrs. Basically the life of capacitors.DavidWM5M Amateur Radio Operator Extra Class for 25 yrs, licensed since 1975...General Radio Telephone License as well, in Whos Who of Video....

{"Title":"High Class TV deserves a high end signal","Author":"RJLOne \"RJLOne\"","ReviewID":"R3EEZGUI2UH30H","Overall":"good","Content":"Let's be honest.  This is one very high class television with all the bells and whistles.  The picture it produces is incredible with either Digital Cable or HDTV signal, and is just as amazing when used with Optical, S-Video, or Progressive Scan component cables from a DVD/VCR.  The clarity, brilliance, and color rendition is A+ through and through.  You'd be hard pressed to find folks to disagree with that.  The area where this TV gets dinged in the same for any large screen LCD, DLP, or Plasma unit - no one likes the low resolution analog delivery when a large widescreen is hooked up to a poor analog cable or worse still VHF or UHF non-digital signal.  So make a commitment now that you are shopping for a big screen HDTV set-up.  If you are willing to spend a couple of grand on a large screen high-end television, you should really give consideration to providing that television with a high-end signal.  That means getting digital cable, satellite (digital signal), a house antenna for free over-the-air HDTV, and investing in a DVD/VCR that has the modern outputs.  Do that and you are going to be in awe each night you settle in front of this television.  Don't do it and you are going to settle for less than this television can provide.I've owned this television for about one year now.  I can tell you that it is highly impressive.  The clarity and depth of the picture are astonishing and the brilliance is fantastic.  Style-wise, okay, the newer model of this same system is more \"modern\" than this.  Sound-wise, this system produces clear tones and great surround.  I utilize this set with a home theatre set-up using Optical out from the TV and am immersed with sound.  And I can say that playing Xbox on this set-up with the MS HD component cables is astoundingly realistic.The really great features too are that this does have its own integrated ATSC tuner to decode the HD free over-the-air signals.  And better still the no need for picture-in-picture when you can split the screen and watch them side-by-side (though you can't do that with two ATSC tuned stations - one has to be analog).But probably the best perspective I can give you is that I treat the guests to my home who haven't yet seen such a high-end widescreen television to a bit of a test.  I display for them the analog every day picture first in full 16:9 view and then in 4:3 standard.  They instantly agree that analog in 16:9 is not sharp, and less appealing.  Then I switch it over to a digital connection and they are back to being awed.  Finally, I tune in an HDTV broadcast and everyone is absolutely mesmorized.  During the Superbowl this year one of my party guests exclaimed, \"Wow!  I can see individual faces in the stadium seats when the cameras are watching the action on the field.\"  Yes, I know.  I get that enjoyment every single day when I power up the Sony 50\".  If you are seriously looking to get a big screen, this one is the absolute way to go!  I'll leave the rest to argue over which is better, an LCD Projection, DLP, LCD flat panel, or Plasma.  I already know.  It's sitting in my entertainment center.","Date":"March 7, 2006"}

Helping my son actually worked in my favor, I was very pleased with the HD picture. Then the first bulb went up. Not wanting to be without TV to long I ordered one online I think I paid about $250. I wasn't happy that this TV had bulbs that needed replacing. I'm 45 and don't keep up with technology, what has this world come to?! I grew up when you purchased a TV watched it for at least 10 years (how many hours does that equate too?) before you had to buy another. I think I have been through 3 bulbs since 2005 one was an aftermarket and did not last very long at all. I did find out that one of the company's that sells this bulb is only 2 miles from my house so I could get one pretty quick and not pay shipping. So if your bulb has not gone up yet it would be a good idea to have the order information ready or get a spare. I did find out from my local dealer that once you turn the TV off wait a half an hour before you turn it back on. The bulb needs to cool off and can blow if you turn the TV back on to soon. Well about 6 months ago a blue haze appeared at the bottom of the screen. I moved about 3 months ago, for whatever reason when I turned the TV on the haze was gone and there were 4 small blue dots on the center of sceen. 6 weeks later about half the screen is covered with the blue dots and I decided to look into it online. So it looks like I will just watch until I can't take it any longer. I sure can't afford the repairs and from what I have read Sony isin't much help. I'm not looking forward to purchasing a new TV, not just because of the cost but because of the amount of research required. I just went to a site that has Sony alerts on recalls etc. They will cover costs until June 2010, that is about when my problem started! Imagine that! I will probably look into this a little more, there is a class action law suit. Will I buy Sony again, probably not.","Date":"November 13, 2010"}

Sony is aware of the problem and will not provide a recall.  The cost to replace the optical block is approximately $1,200.00.  Since Sony won't provide an honorable repair for the TV, please don't spend your hard earned money on a TV that will be unusable within 24 months like we did.","Date":"December 13, 2009"}
{"Title":"Horrible","Author":"MattyIce1979","ReviewID":"RLYCXGMSC472D","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had this tv since 2005.  It was in storage for 2.5 years due to some military training I was involved with.  Storage in a home (never turned on).  About 2 years ago it started to get a flickering blue/white light (very small like pin size) appear on the tv.  So at that time it was like 3 years old (usage time).  Within 2 weeks there were 30 plus small flickering lights spreading through my screen like cancer.  Today the screen is unwatchable, and I just bought a new tv today thank god- it's been a two year long-time coming event.  TV cancer has spread to it's entire screen.I called Sony a year ago to ask if they would give me a new tv or at least half off and they scoffed at my request (reasonable I thought since their tv was flawed- see litagation cases online for this model), and offered me $200 off another tv (a 60\" for 950- which you can beat that deal anywhere you look online).  I decided that it was neither worth my time or money to take them to court, so i did not.I have also had to order a Replacement Lamp for the tv which set me back another $60 (this was prior to my tv going completely Cancerous).I suggest to never buy this TV or purchase any Sony TV, because their customer service is horrible and their products are worse.Goodluck!","Date":"January 23, 2013"}

{"Title":"How I Found my HDTV","Author":"Richard Krzemien","ReviewID":"R6FWB0T6QX736","Overall":"good","Content":"I started searching for an HDTV about seven-years ago while doing some work at CES in Las Vegas.  I still remember the moment I spotted my first HD set there.  It was a 60\" Zenith showing a Dallas Cowboys football game.  I stared at the box for about an hour with a small drop of drool hanging from my chin-despite really disliking the Cowboys.  After talking with the sales rep., I was sure I'd have a set within a year.  Then the HD standards wars began, things got ugly and everything was put on hold.Years passed.  My son, who was 9-years old at the time of the CES show, got older and I got grumpier.With each passing season I would check out every new HDTV set.  I looked at successive generations of plasmas, front projectors, DLPS, LCDs,  rear-projection RGB sets and D-ILAs.  Each time I thought, this year, this technology will be the one where cost, styling and picture quality converge to produce the winner.  But plasma was way too expensive, and every other technology had artifacts that left me wanting.  And that Zenith I saw at CES? That was a one-of-a-kind TV that cost about 100K.  So each year my son and I returned home empty handed.Then last year I walked into a showroom and my heart fluttered for the first time since that day in Vegas.  Sitting on a high-tech stand was a stunning Sony 60\" Grand Vega XBR.  It was a gorgeous package with an amazingly sharp picture.  But after looking closer, I started seeing artifacts that made me reconsider:  Fast motion sequences would pixelate.  The \"screen door effect\" started bothering me, and the shiny glass font reflected everything that wasn't black.  What I thought was going to be a long-term relationship-and an important bonding experience with my son-became a 1-hour fling.  My son didn't talk to me for a week.Then this past October (2004), Sony released its KDF-60XS955.  I read every review.  I scanned all the specs.  I waited for it to arrive somewhere, anywhere.  Then one day as I was walking through Frys, I spotted one on the showroom floor and immediately fell in love.  In fact, I was stunned at how attractive the entire package was: great looks, great price, and a great picture.  Something had to be wrong.I didn't tip my hand immediately.  I went home and came back a few days later to see if my memory of the set was as good as the actual thing.  Amazingly, it was.  That had never happened before.  When viewing other sets for a second time, I found that my memory of them was always better than the real thing.So I came back to view the 60XS955 five more times, and each time the picture thrilled me. I was even more amazed when I learned that the 60XS955 I had been looking at was connected to a set of rabbit ears-not cable or satellite like all the other sets-just a $12 piece of metal sitting on top of the Sony. I went to other stores to see what the picture looked like connected to satellite and I was even more impressed.Needless to say, I finally bought one.  When it arrived and I turned it on, it looked even better than in the showroom.  It took a few days to figure out that, since I don't have 90 fluorescent tube lights installed in the ceiling of my living room, I don't have all that ambient light reflecting off the front of the screen.  When my now 16-year-old son first saw the picture (during a Lakers/Rockets game that was being broadcast in HD) he hugged me and said those three words every father longs to hear, \"So how much?\"  I told him it was about $700 below retail (Pacific Sales in L.A.)  He then mumbled that he loved me and we all watched the game together.If you're interested in all the specs, you can easily get them from Sony.  But here are a few that were important to me.  This set finally incorporates and standardizes a number of different technologies.  For example, it has a CableCard input.  I have cable, so by renting the CableCard and avoiding the charge for a second cable box from Time Warner, I save $5.50/mo.  I believe the CableCard also produces a cleaner signal, but I've not done a side-by-side comparison yet.The set has a built-in HD turner if you want to pick up off-the-air broadcasts with your own set of $12 rabbit ears.  The front screen has a matt finish so you won't see those nasty glass reflections that the XBR series produces.  Possibly because of the matt finish and a smaller chipset most, if not all, of the \"screen door effect\" has been eliminated.  The processors are now faster so there's little to no pixelation in the background of fast-moving sequences, unlike the current crop of DLP sets that produce a tiling effect with fast moving images. The NTSC tuner has been greatly improved so normal, non-digital or non-HD broadcasts are watchable.  (You immediately get spoiled with HD, so anything less is a letdown, but they're watchable.)  All of these advances have converged to produce images that almost look 3-D when viewing HD broadcasts.This 60\" Sony also sports the new HDMI connection standard that allows for uncompressed HD and non-HD DVD viewing with DVD players that have an HDMI output.  The remote is adequate, but somewhat of a letdown.  The accompanying Sony stand is a bit expensive but gorgeous, and a perfect match for this set.  This year's stand also has 2 shelves; unlike the one shelve on last year's XBR model.  The sound is rich and full with a respectable sub-woofer.  All of that and the TV weighs only about 113 lbs.A side note:  I've read that some people have complained about visual noise or distortion.  I believe much of it comes from cheap cables and connectors.  This set is very sensitive and very big.  Small amounts of snow on a 27\" set can look like a snowstorm on a 60\" set.  But with the right cables the picture is crystal clear.  So don't cheep out.  Get the more expensive shielded, gold-plated cables, like those from Monster, for example.  Also, get an AC line filter and surge protector (About $79.  Mine is also a Monster.  It will clean up the picture, protect the sensitive electronics and extend the life of the bulb).  With those added items, this TV should look like you're viewing reality.So after a seven-year wait, I've finally found my HD set.  My son has a new-found respect for my nerdy side, my wife now knows that there really wasn't \"another woman\" working at Frys I'd been seeing, and the space I had reserved seven-years ago along the wall in my living room has finally been filled with a truly beautiful piece of technology.Richard Krzemien[...]","Date":"December 29, 2004"}
{"Title":"First Impression: A great new model Sony HDTV","Author":"G. Davis","ReviewID":"R35ZSHGLV2X8EI","Overall":"good","Content":"First impresssion:  I love it.  The HD picture is absolutely gorgeous and, happily, the SD picture seems to be very much improved over what the Sony HDTV's produced with their 2003 models. The TV has two tuners, including a built-in digital HDTV tuner, and it will accept a \"cable card\" so you don't need a box.The manual leaves something to be desired.  Many subjects that should be discussed in detail are barely mentioned.  I wonder if the manual-writers actually watched or adjusted this TV before writing about it.Example: The \"Live Color\" setting merits only a sentence or two in the manual but, as the default setting from the factory, it made all the white areas of the picture swim crazily, like a 1960's \"psychedelic\" poster until, through trial and error, I found it buried in \"Advanced\" video settings and turned it off.There are two coax cable inputs, \"VHF/UHF\" and \"Cable\".  I think the former is mostly for attaching an external antenna and your cable from the wall really has to go into the other one but this is not made clear.  In any case, cable attached to \"VHF/UHF\" will not tune to very many channels and there is no setting in the menus to alter this.  The manual is not helpful on this subject.\"Twin View\" is great -- very useful, very intuitive.The TV's styling, with speaker \"wings\" out on either side of the screen, is very beautiful.Sony had a lot of trouble with lamp and lamp-starter problems in the 2003 models, which they believe they fixed in mid-2004.  We can be hopeful that, in the new models, they have fixed it for good.All I have right now are my first impressions and they are very, very good.  I love this TV!","Date":"October 28, 2004"}

I had to replace the original bulb after the first year and am still using the replacement.Before I get into the review let it be known Sony is being sued for knowingly selling us a defective set. As good as this set looks on the outside, they all have a design flaw: The optical block or light engine assembly.This is a very expensive ($1400) piece to replace that was not designed correctly. It warps because of heat and results in splotches and screen image issues. On my TV, ghosting occurs. Sony extended the warranty of these TV's to 2008 but the issue did not occur on my TV till 3 months ago.Sony never did redesign the replacement part, so on the TV's that sony did repair in warranty, those parts are only going to last another 2-3 years.The only equitable recourse purchasers of these models have is to either sell them for scrap and purchase a newer model LCD or take their light engine out and send it in for repair. There is a company or two out there that will rebuild them for around $300 with a 6 month warranty but expect the issue to come back again in another 3-4 years.So, for as good as the picture looks on these televisions, which is great, the above issue ruins the entire model. You are gambling with your money and time purchasing one of these sets.If it did not have this issue, and if the part was redesigned to correct the flaw, it would have received all 5 stars but as it is, this is a rip off and a knife in my side from a company such as sony.Everything in my house is sony, from my alarm clock to the receiver in my car, but no more. A company that would sell a life time customer such as myself a TV for $3500 knowing it was defective and not even have the decency to correct the flaw does not deserve my nor your business.Shame and you Sony.","Date":"November 17, 2010"}

What impressed me was the standard def picture. Most HD sets look really really good in HD but fall flat on their face in std. def. This set looked reasonably good in SD in the store so I hoped it would at home. It did. Not as good as my old RPTV but good enough. The HD images (especially on Discovery HDT) are unreal and very 3D. It shows up some HD channels that compress to much in their broadcast.There are always anomolies with high tech items and this set is no exception, hence 4 stars not 5 for what is a very good set.1) Audio out doesn't work like expected. If you have a set of wireless headphones, say one from Sony?, you can't use them. You see, you have to TURN OFF the attached speakers to use the audio out jacks. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?! ADA FAILURE.2) Say you take the time to label all your channels so they read CNN NBC ABC etc as you surf. Then let's say down the road you scan the channels to see if your CATV provider added any new ones. Well all that work went down the drain because it erases all the labels. OOPS!3)Let's say you have a TiVo or ReplayTV and hook it to input 3 using S-Video. What about none of the label choices say DVR until input 5/Component.Am I picky? Sure, it's $4K! There shouldn't be any issues, they should use the set they make and figure it out before selling it.One more thing, I'm using a Harmony 676 and it has discreet input codes all the way to input 7, then 8 is 7 + up one. Maybe that's a Harmony issue, but I don't think Sony has a discreet code for input 8. Oh Well.It's still a good set and has very nice imaging!","Date":"January 31, 2005"}

In 2005 while buying DVD's I wanted to stroll thru the TV's and see the new technology. That's when I came across Sony's art work. Stylish frame with the side speakers was impressive. A matte front panel to protect the screen and reduce glare (not many with this feature), good for little kids that have to touch everything! It's more affordable with the combination of projection with the sharp picture of an HD LCD. If your kids play a lot of video games (me sometimes) you don't have to worry about screen burn. HDMI connections with more than enough video ports to hook up everything - HD satellite box, receiver/amplifier, DVD, VCR, Xbox, Wii, Play Station 3. Plus Memory stick compatible to really show off the family pictures (so your old parents can see them)! ;^) As far as HD action goes - I watch Discovery HD, HD sports, HD movies action and Sci Fi with no problems. Once you go HD it's difficult to watch standard definition. Put it this way, after looking at it on the sales room floor and finding out about it's features I looked at my wife to discuss finances when she said \"Go ahead and get it, I love it.\". Sold!

I have enjoyed the sound in watching concert videos, such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Jefferson Airplane, the Who, James Taylor, etc.  The controls are complicated and not well designed.  There are too many buttons, and it is hard to find on the remote what you want it to do.  The high-def picture is excellent.  I have it hooked up to a Cablevision box.  The best picture is for baseball and football games, PBS high-def, and the Tonight Show with Leno.  For some reason, these shows stand out in their clear crisp picture and sound.  The price of this TV has dropped considerably over the past few months, so it is an even better buy.  Don't try to save a little money by buying a no-name brand.

Right off the box and after connecting to regular cable to it, it doesn't bring out the optimum reception.  Actually, it looked pretty average and even looked like total crap on some channels until I got the HDTV receiver and saw what high definition TV is *supposed* to look like.  You can still connect this TV to component video and get a nice reception, but nothing beats HDMI.  Trust me, it's worth shelling out an expensive HDMI cable for this - there is a BIG difference from component video to HDMI - so I would definitely recommend that you connect it this way.

{"Title":"Great Value","Author":"Robert Traub \"Robert Traub\"","ReviewID":"R3ERVD89CL33YR","Overall":"good","Content":"My old projection TV died (the cost of repair exceeded what I originally paid for it), and I went in search of a new one.  One of the big electronics stores was having a floor model sale, and given the huge discounts off the regular price, I was drooling. I had a choice between all the top brands (they were clearing everything out to put new models on the floor) and the opportunity to compare them side by side.  While RCA is a name steeped in history, I wasn't aware they were still in the game until I came upon this unit.  When I saw the picture this unit produces, I was hooked; it exceeded anything in the price range.  Yes, there were TV's from the leading projection, LCD and plasma players that had remarkable pictures, but I wasn't interested in them for (literally) thousands more.  I agonized about buying this \"low-end\" RCA, but finally decided to give it a new home. In the ensuing 5 months, I have not regretted it.Before going further, there are a few essential caveats I must state. First and foremost, I do not have cable or satellite. The TV lives in a somewhat rural, mountainous area, and over-the-air reception is impossible. The house is a second/ weekend home, and I cannot justify the expenditure of $45+ per month for what might amount to 5 hours of cable viewing per week. My experience with the TV is therefore only via DVD. I have a run-of-the-mill Sony progressive scan DVD player, and with that, the resultant picture quality is excellent. I get \"Wow's\" from the neighbors.  I originally had the video output running through an older DVD player, and bumping up to a progressive scan made a positive difference in picture quality. The DVD audio runs through the surround system, so I cannot speak to the quality of the audio from the TV itself (and with movie soundtracks, who is NOT listening to their surround system?).  Given the picture quality that 480i DVD provides, I can only imagine what HDTV looks like.With that said, I again state the value of the TV is great. The on-screen menu is terrific. The manual did not come with the TV, and until I downloaded it from the web, I had to make do and set the TV up without it.  No problem. The menus are logical and have quite a level of descriptive depth to them, which is a godsend. The remote control is fine. I wish the button names lit up and were a tad bigger, but it is reasonably operable as is.  The manual, by the way, is written clearly, and in English, by someone writing in their native language.  Another kudo!  I have read reviews that speak to black levels in the set not being as good as they should be, colors being a tad off, and a noisy fan. In my showroom side by side comparison, this picture excelled, and I have not been in any way disappointed with it at home. Less-than-black blacks, and colors that are off according to sophisticated test DVDs do not detract from my own low-tech sensors: my eyes.  I also have not witnessed any blurring, rainbow or motion-related problems that some DLP sets have.While I chose to live dangerously and not take the \"insurance policy\" the store tried to sell me, I did some research on the web and bought a replacement lamp for the set. The salesperson made a strong point that the lamp in any DLP set WILL burn out. The likelihood of it burning out sooner in this floor model is even greater, so I hedged my bet by getting two, just in case.  I would rather have the spares (around $200), and piece of mind when the lamp inevitably fails.  If something larger craps out, e.g. the light engine (> $900), then I guess I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.Even as I contemplate bringing a widescreen TV into my \"main\" home, I find the combination of picture quality and lower price that the RCA DLP offers is tough to beat.  I have looked at the competition, and the price difference to bump up to other manufacturers becomes difficult to reconcile.","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

I kept checking the sound on every channel to see if it said mono, because it sure didn't sound like stereo to me.  I went through both manuals, trying to find some adjustment I could make to improve the picture and the sound.  I even went out and bought the suggested S video cable, but I couldn't see any difference in the picture once I plugged it in.But all that changed as soon as I popped in my Batman Begins DVD.Wow.  This monitor is the bomb.  The sound is indeed stereo with rich tones and good separation.  The picture is great with fantastic resolution, more than I hoped for.I wish that the print in the user's manual were actually large enough for me to read with my 40+ year old eyes and that the onscreen menu were easier to maneuver.  But it's clear to me that this thing was designed for watching DVDs in widescreen and at that, it absolutely excels.  TV people look a bit squat and the sound is more like flat mono than stereo.  Who needs television anyway?  If you use this equipment for watching DVDs only, it will be well worth the price you paid for it.  I have no complaints with it now.","Date":"October 31, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best 26\" LCD HDTV ? Maybe ......","Author":"Sean","ReviewID":"R77AGS18EHA85","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, this is probably a good \"value\" considering it's currently low price point ($699-$799 + Rebates), and it has a decent array of inputs, and it comes right out of the box ready to go (stand is already attached). but that's where it all comes to a subtle stop.I'll explain. After a lightning storm took out a 5 year old analog 32\" 'square' TV, i said \"yep, it's time for another widescreen HDTV\" . We own a 55\" Hitachi Ultravision Projection and it has awesome written all over it. Maybe I set my expectation a little high on the LCD, even though I never expected an LCD to look near as good as the Hitachi.My direction was pointing to CRT (conventional picture tube) Widescreens. 30\" from Sony (KVH-30hs420), Panasonic (Tau), Toshiba (30hf85) and Philips (30pw911od). Where this is where I wish I hand ended up, instead of beganLCD are incapable of reproducing images as clear as CRT's . period.there's just something about LCD's that have always bugged me. the Black's are never 'black' , action creates artifacting (blocks of pixels), graphic and text looks overprocessed. This Olevia has some of those (but not all) and a few of its own)Pros and Cons------------Pros :Nice footprint30 lbs - easily mountable on a wallInputs for days : VGA / DVI / Component x2 / S-Video x 2 / Composite x 2Clean and usable interfacethe new IDEA technology works ... sortaHD broadcasts look great but not awesomehooked up a Dell laptop via VGA and it looked real nice, but....Cons :VGA is locked at 16:9Nice footprint , but the foot isn't removable (so I've read)would look nice on a wall, if you could remove the stand (foot)the inputs are nice to have lots of, anything Composite (Yellow) is sure to look badthe added EQ and Surround modes are nifty, but some of the Surrounds are uselessthe remote is too simple, but it does allow you to access everything (which isn't much)-except you cannot change aspect ratio with remotenon-HD Letterboxed programs are tiny. the letterboxing bars are almost as big as the imagethere is a line of time code viweable at the top of the screen.-there is no way of stretching it out-the only way to change aspects is to go into the menu-there should be an \"Aspect\" button on the remote-in the video menu there are options to adjust the screen vertically and horizontally-these options are \"shaded\" and are not accessible by the user. VGA use only - that sux15:9 is an awkward ratio. Some say you can't notice it, but you can - if you look-16:9 mode effectively crops 1/2 inch of both the top and bottom of the screenIDEA technology kinda does what it says, but I didn't see it as dramatic as it's shownThere is no way to stretch out a 4:3 image to 16:9-your aspect options are FULL /4:3/ 16:9 / Panoramic-what I had to do was go into a secret menu on my Motorola Cable Box-when asks : 4:3 Override ? - you have to select STRETCH. I had override set to 480pSettings from the factory need adjusting-if you are unfamiliar with adjusting video you might get an undesirable pictureFinal Thoughts -I wanted to like this LCD. I thought maybe someone had finally got an LCD to look good with TV broadcasts, and while Syntax-Olevia is probably doing a better job then anyone else in the range, they still haven't got it where an A/V enthusiast is going to be pleased with the final results.Pictures are still to 'washed' for my liking, and watching any action or sports has got to be a struggle. Static or normal images look great, but once things start to move or speed up they lose it.Using my little cable box trick (which everyone should now) solves some problems but complicates others. 1st -the trick. with your cable box OFF, select MENU on the front of the box (not the remote), you should get a grey tech screen. it'll ask you the display type and 480i override options as well as Component outputI've met quite a few people who had their component outs to 480i and the screen type to 4:3 , whic would solve some issues.Type - 16:9Output - 1080i (or 720p)480i Override - StretchBut to this point, I cannot remove the line of code at the top of the screen----called Syntax Support (1-888-Syntax-8) nice quick response \"We usually only see that w/ DVI connections\"so why do i see it on Component ? \"Maybe it's the cable box\"So, i checked some channels. It seems that once you get passed chanel 70 the line goes away, which is about where the DigiCable starts.too bad we have SciFi , Spike, Comedy, Nickelodeon, etc.. under that thresholdi'm also not encouraged by this being a DVI observed anamolyI'm going to give this monitor 1 week. If I haven't figured it out, it's going backwhich will be a shame because I really wanted to like this settoo bad I started out looking at CRT's whose images are much sharperbut for someone who just has to have there TV mounted on a wallor wants both a TV and a PC monitor, they won't find a better LCD at a better pricePaid - $699 w/$100 Rebate = ($599) September 1, 2005well worth the money. Syntax makes a quality product in the Olevia lineI started to give this a 3, but I will give it a 4 and consider that the code line is a product of the Cable Box, however, if you can adjust picture orientation in VGA, you should be able to do the same in DVI and ComponentI'll also take into account that LCD's aren't capable of being as clear as CRT. Having said that, this is one of the better pictures I've ever seen on an LCD; and by far the best for $700","Date":"August 31, 2005"}
{"Title":"I'm pleased with it!","Author":"AbeStreet","ReviewID":"R2ISRBU15V3C91","Overall":"good","Content":"The purchase of the LT26HVE 26 represented our families first venture into the world of flat screen television.  We have, over the past few years, explored the flat screen market and always found the price of a nice sized television to be the biggest obstacle.  Well, when we found this television for below $700 we figured now was the time to take the plunge.  We were concerned about purchasing a television from a company we had never heard of until the sales rep explained to us why this set was as good as many name brand televisions.  The sales rep actually took the time to point out the pros and cons.  I usually don't pay much attention to greedy sales reps, but this guy really seemed more concerned with making sure we understood what we were purchasing than with making sure we purchased any old television.Anyway, here are a list of the pro's and cons.Pros1. Light weight.  I usually get a good work out hauling around our 27 inch and 32 inch tube televisions, by comparison, the  LT26HVE 26 seemed as light as a feather.  My lower back loves the television more than the rest of my body.2. Easy hook up.  Like many people I shun reading the manuals, at least with this television I didn't need it for the installation of the various cables.3. The on screen menu options are fairly easy to understand and follow.4. The DVD picture is good.  Our cable pictures are about the same as our tube pictures.  We don't have HDTV yet and so I can't blame the television for not improving our cable image.5. I'm pleased with the sound.  I should mention that this television is in our bedroom and so we don't play it with the volume up that loud.6. I don't want to beat a dead horse but the price is really good.  I guess I'm a little cheap, because it's going to take one heck of salesmen to get me to spend a Grand or more on a television.7. The picture is still pretty clear when not viewing the screen while directly in front of it.8. This television comes equipped to handle just about any kind of connection you may have.  I doubt I'll use the television for a computer monitor or to play games on but at least I have the option.  It's the first television I've been able to use with an S Cable connection for the DVD player.Cons1. Screen burn out may be a problem.  I prefer to watch shows and movies that are shown in the 4:3 aspect ratio in that ratio.  I don't like stretching the image to accommodate a wider aspect ratio.  I've been warned that the reduced image may cause the cropping lines to be burned into the screen over time.  I guess some newer televisions come with a feature that slowly shifts the cropped screen from side to side so that screen burnout can be avoided.  I don't believe this television has that feature.2. There is no \"Sleep\" function on the remote.  For me this is a big \"con.\"  I'm used to hopping into bed and tapping the sleep button to set the television to shut off within a half hour.  Now I have to flip through the menu options and set the television to shut off at a specific time.  I also have to adjust the time to 24 hour (military) time.  Seems kind of slow and outdated to me.  I haven't purchased a television within the last fifteen years that didn't have a \"Sleep\" button.3. Call me crazy but I kind of like a tube picture.  I know LCD's are all the rage these days but I think my tube televisions are richer in color than LCD's?  Also, my eyes get a little sore after staring at this LCD.  It may just be me but I think LCD's are harder on the eyes.In the end this television has more pros than cons.  We are considering purchasing a 32 inch model for our downstairs family room.","Date":"February 23, 2006"}

BUT if you plan to use it for SDTV viewing (the number of HDTV channels offered through cable and satellite are still low) then this TV is not for you.I returned it and found a Sony KLV-S23A10 for $877 locally in central NJ.  The Sony is 100% better at displaying SDTV and HDTV than this thing.  Your safer buying a 1st tier manu. (Sony, Pioneer, Sharp, panasonic) than the low end of the market.One more thing.

Now I'm no expert regarding the performance of various comparable units, but I've found this TV to more than satisfy my goals of upgrading my modest home entertainment system without breaking my budget.My only negative comment relates to sound quality, which I consider fair to poor. Regardless,  I am running sound through my home entertainment system so that issue is irrelevant for me, but possibly not for others.One suggestion, if you go comparison shopping at big box stores like Best Buy you are likely to be drawn to 32\" and larger LCD TV's.

I only have a standard cable connection and when I hooked this TV up to it using the antenna connection, I had the following problems:-The color depth would sometimes diminish, i.e., the picture would only have a couple of shades of each color and also appear grainy.-As I understood the manual, when the input is standard 4:3 (as I get through my cable), then selecting 16:9 would zoom in, preserving the aspect ration.  Unfortunately the 16:9 did not preserve the aspect ration, but stretched the image horizontally, leaving blank lines above and below the picture.  It behaved the same as the \"panoramic\" mode.I figured it wasn't worth the headache to resolve problems since I could just go back to my old 25\" tube TV and not have any problems - a clear picture with great color all the time, and no aspect ratio distortion.I did not hook it up to my DVD player or an HDTV receiver.

The light can be bright and the TV's in our bedroom which made it hard to sleep, so what I did was take a tiny strip of black electrical tape and covered the tip of the power button. Problem solved, no more blue light. The strip of tape is tiny and you can't even see it because everything is black anyway. Don't let the light keep you from buying this TV because it's easy to fix like I did, and you won't find a better price on an LCD TV of this quality and size.Also, people here are saying this TV doesn't work with a universal remote.

Wanted to be able to use as a computer monitor also.  Believe me, anyone into electronics and specs and having half normal intelligence on using settings can get this TV to work beautifully!!!  Seeing the prices on other LCDs, plasmas and \"rear projection\" TVs, a bit of advise - save your money and be confident in purchasing this \"very\" reasonably priced Syntax Olevia.  Yes, the company has only been in business for a couple of years, but doing research, they are now the 3rd highest rated in LCDs. Reviews in many electronics magazines recommend highly.  Pretty good for a new company!  As for using for a monitor - only a 6 ft. cable comes with the set.  Make sure you spend the extra money and invest into a high-end cable, e.g. the Belkin Pro Series High Integrity VGA/SVGA replacement monitor cable.  Try not to use an extension - go for a m/m replacement cable.  Most stores, e.g. Staples, etc. do not know lower end cables are not recommended for monitors larger then 17-19\". This High Integrity is used for larger TV/Monitors - over 17-19\".  As for adding speakers, etc., again - use high-end cables!  Regarding remote - programmed my cable remote to run the system.  Only need Syntax remote to adjust settings.  Can program ANY remote to control this LCD.  Am debating whether to purchase another, maybe larger, before pricing goes up.  Syntax knows they have a GOOD PRODUCT.  You won't be sorry.  Only reason so reasonably priced is to get their product out there to show what they've got.  Good strategy!  Another bit of info - worked with Bose since their inception.  If you respect the Bose systems, take the advise from someone who's worked with electronics engineers since the 1960's.

For one thing, if you have the backlight set to anything below 100%, the TV makes a buzzing, humming sound (which is mostly drowned out by the fan on my HTPC :-P).  The remote that I got likes to act up as well - sometimes it works, other times it doesn't.  The contrast is excellent, although the blacks aren't really pure black, and you can have some wicked backlight patterns if you don't adjust your settings properly.  If you don't know much about LCDs, you may want to purchase another TV, but if you're a geek (like me), this TV is for you.  I hope this review helped! God Bless, and Happy Shopping!!!!","Date":"March 9, 2006"}
{"Title":"Excellent Value for TV or Monitor","Author":"Robert","ReviewID":"R3NC5L4W9CJBF4","Overall":"good","Content":"I received the LT26HVE with plans to use it as a big desktop monitor.  I'm used to a big monitor since I burned out my 6-year-old 21\" CRT.  I was a little worried about how this would perform based upon some of the reviews but am happy to report that it works excellently in practice. I have two computers connected, one with the DVI port and one with the VGA port. I've set both graphics cards to run at the native 1280 x 768 resolution with excellent results. The display will actually interpolate a number of resolutions (from 640x480 to 1280x1280). At first I was concerned that the VGA output was cut-off at one side, but after reading the manual discovered that the \"Auto\" button on the remote automatically detects the extents of the video input and adjusts the display in a snap.There are a myriad of options for personalizing the display and color temperatures to your tastes.  HD Broadcast output looks outstanding.A couple things detract from this, but aren't really big negatives because of the economical price.  These are the somewhat odd (15:9) aspect ratio which makes very narrow letterboxing around standard HDTV or WS movie content. The second thing is the desktop stand which seems like it could be a little sturdier (metal instead of plastic would have been nice).","Date":"July 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great LCD","Author":"Tobin T. Bradley \"fuzzytolerance\"","ReviewID":"RKCANLGFEDTM1","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this LCD for a couple of weeks, and I have to say it has done everything I could throw at it extremely well.I had it running straight coax cable, which yields a fair picture (which is what I get generally from straight-up cable).  Running from the S-video off of an Adelphia cable box gives a noticably better picture.  I would rate the SV output from the cable box as very good to excellent (probalby depending on whether the signal from the box is true digital or analog converted to digital).  As I don't have HD from cable yet, I can't comment on that.I do, however, have HD 1080i coming from my Xbox (component video HD adapter), and that looks spectacular.  I think there were a couple of times in Doom III where I physically ducked.  Gaming with this thing is excellent.I'm also running the VGA output from my PC in to it at 1280x768 (what it does natively - if you do other resolutions, expect some compression/expansion and some loss in picture quality).  It looks every bit as good as the Dell 17\" LCD it was replacing, and a heck of a lot bigger to boot (26\" at 1280x768 is freaking huge).DVD's look great too.  I've run s-video from my cheap DVD player, and it looked great, and I've played DVD's on my computer fullscreen and it looked great as well.  I'd be interested to see if one of those up-converting DVD players make any difference, but as it is DVD's look teriffic.The PIP options are very nice.  You can take any of the inputs and PIP them, so you can have your computer running and TV in a window or vice versa.  You can also do a split screen, though both sides will be a bit compressed, so don't expect great picture quality there.The only knock I would give it is the remote is a bit spartan.  You have to do a lot of toggling around to do some things they could have made a button for.  For example, to get the PIP you want you may have to hit the View button several times and the Swap button once or twice.  Rather than having a button for each AV input, you pull up a menu on the screen and toggle around for a bit to change sources.Despite the remote, for everything it does extremely well, the vast array of inputs, and the overall design and picture quality, I have to give it five stars.  If it were over $1k, I'd knock it a star for the little things, but for well under $700 with rebates it's a steal in my opinion.","Date":"September 12, 2005"}

The HD content was immaculate, the analog was surprisingly good, and the composite was very grainy, as I expected. The \"sleep\" feature on the tv is more complicated than it should be and requires the user to scroll through a couple of menus to get to (there is no button on the remote). The tv arrived packaged very well, and setup was a no-brainer. The only issue I've had so far is that the tv does not repsond to the remote for the first minute after it is turned on. Tech support was helpful and sent me a firmware upgrade but I havent had a chance to try it yet.Overall, I am thrilled with its sleek design, great picture quality and most of all, the price!","Date":"October 3, 2005"}

It came out of the box easily and replaced my old tube in my room. I'll just give a brief layout of what is good and what is bad.Good-Picture looks great and its very bright.-Speakers are decent.-Price is unbeatable ((...))-Component pictures (720p) look amazing.Bad-There is an airy noise on the composite, tv, and svideo inputs, only audible on the very lowest volume settings.-TV Tuner is ok, it won't win any awards.Neutral-There is a light on the power button that turns on when the TV is off. This is ok in some environments, but in my pitch-black bedroom, the light had to be covered up (easy with a piece of electrical tape).-Not a common manufactuerer so universal remotes are a little harder to program. I just did a code search and one of them worked fine.When it comes down to it, this TV is the off-brand of the same parts that sony or phillips might use. Its great for any room, especially with the price tag.","Date":"December 27, 2005"}

It will also serve as a television. The picture is absolutely beautiful. I didn't have to change any picture settings out of the box. GTA:SA supports this monitor's native resolution. Playing GTA and Halo for PC I have not noticed any \"ghosting\" and picture quality is impeccable. Having a screen this big in front of you to play makes you feel as though you are really in the games. Only complaint I have is that this venerable wall of light and color is a good deal bigger than it appears to be in the pictures. If you plan to use this as a monitor, be sure you can set it back a few feet on your desk. It does produce some heat if it is kept too close. I doubt I will ever be able to use a small monitor again. DVD playback is excellent. It is great to finally be rid of those dreaded \"black bars\" around all of my widescreen DVD's.  One other word of advice: this TV does require about four seconds of warm-up time before it will turn on, the same thing applies when switching PIP windows, there is a several second delay while the TV processes switching the two pictures. This is normal.","Date":"July 22, 2005"}

The TV is perfect as a wall mount (bought the mount at Wal-Mart) and doesn't take a lot of room.  TV has a great picture with a good viewing angle, but doesn't support HDTV input through HDMI (the new standard) only through component video or RGB.  Remote is not very logical and takes some practice to use.  My biggest complaint is that Syntax will not pay their rebates.

The red was dull and other colors were not very sharp either.  Then I read in lot of reviews that you are supposed to adjust the colors of the LCD TVs.  Adjusting the colors made a big difference.Color adjustment is also one of the reasons I find it difficult to select the LCD TV from the store.  They set the colors of some TVs and not the others, so sometimes best TV ends up looking worse than the worst TV.There is no information in the manual on how to take off the stand to hang it on the wall.  I had to email Costomer Service to get that information.  In short, you have to unscrew 6-7 screws to take the stand off.So far I really like this TV.","Date":"March 20, 2006"}

And the bonus is that it's an HD ready TV. Considering this, it's a great buy. DVD's look great. I can't comment much on TV reception because at this time I have it connected to an outdoor antenna, (Yes, I'm still living in the dark ages). The picture is good.

The picture quality is so-so, but the price (much less than what's listed here) was great.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's very difficult to get hold of customer service/tech support.  I was noticing a very large amount of light leak at the corners, and called them up.  They had UPS pick up my tv and it was returned to me quickly.  Unfortunately, the leakage wasn't fixed.  The light leak I'm talking about is bright white in the corners with the white diffusing over at least an inch square in each corner.  This is noticeable when viewing a dvd that has a wider aspect ratio, thus giving the black bars on top and bottom.  Is anyone else seeing this problem?  I called them up again, and tech support insisted this was normal.  I work in high tech myself, and never have I seen an LCD with this much leakage.

I must qualify my remarks to explain that I have only experienced brief viewing on one other HD TV, so I am kinda wowed by the experience. I bought it for the classroom at my birthing center, where clients watch instructional videos and the kids who accompany their mothers watch kids videos. I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary, I just wanted an easy to view TV that didn't take up the space of a refrigerator.WOW! the picture is fabulous! Just watching one thing on this TV will immediately ruin your experience of a \"normal\" TV. After watching a few things on this TV, I had to immediately order one for home. We got the 32\" and love it just as much. The speakers are not fabulous, but that is easily remedied with an inexpensive surround sound system. It even comes with an attachment to plug in to your computer (not that I have tried this yet), which seems pretty cool.Of course, the best thing about this TV is the price. It is easily 2/3 the price of \"name brand\" flat screens. I was a little nervous about buying an \"off-brand\" TV, but the quality of this unit is obvious. I guess they save money by not having the expensive advertising campaigns like the other brands.Now my mother-in-law wants one -- she had been looking at the $2000+ units at the big electronic stores and had to see this one to believe that a decent HD TV could be had for under $1000.It is simple to install -- comes out of the box with the feet installed -- just plug in your components into the clearly labeled slots and away you go!","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

A thin fuzzy red line on the bottom was the result of using the optional DVI hookup rather than the three-plug composite video system. A nice chat with the awesome Syntax customer service straighted me out [\"...save the DVI hookup for a DVD player...the DVI plus is meant for a computer monitor given that it does not scan the same way as the HDTV cable output...\"].

However, the picture blanks out completely to a \"no signal\" status if the TV input signal is weak, as it is on some of our cable channels.  It looks fine on our satellite receiver.I DO NOT recommend this model as a PC monitor.  It lacks the typical control functions of a PC monitor, such as screen adjustments, making it useless to us where we had planned to use it as a monitor on a gaming PC.  Video games showed distorted pictures and/or some of the playable screen and controls off the edge of the screen.  While the aspect ratio can be changed in TV mode, for some reason, it cannot be changed in VGA mode, so we couldn't correct this.  We will end up using it as a DVD display for the kids instead.

Jaeger \"Flick Fan\"","ReviewID":"RWSWFH7K3OY1K","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this to replace my NEC 17\" LCD Monitor which I use for both TV and computer use(ATI All-in-Wonder TV/Video card in the computer) The NEC has about twice the native resolution as this unit and the image is a knockout, though small. When used as a computer monitor/web browser the Olevia is borderline. I had to increase the type size about double to avoid ragged edges and reading difficulty. This makes each web page full screen width and thus there is a great deal of scrolling to see each page. Even at this size I miss the type resolution of the NEC. The story is the same for use as a TV with an analog signal - I miss the resolution of the NEC but like the screen size of the Olevia.Then I play DVDs the story is different - the resolution and image quality are quite good, especially for the price. Since this is the quality I will get when all the broadcasters complete thier conversion to digital transmission, all will be well. It is difficult to get the skin tone right (too much red, as mentioned elsewhere) though I eventually did get it too an acceptable level. I have decided to keep this and sell the NEC.","Date":"June 25, 2005"}

I note that their BBB score is now a `D'.Original review (12/12/05): Too good to be true? I plugged it into a 2-slot electrical outlet. (Such ungrounded electrical outlets are common in older homes.) Careful! My unit had 120 volts on the coaxial (cable) input. Accidentally, I touched the cable to my stereo case, and it had a HUGE spark. It must have enough current to give a dangerous shock.After one-half a day of calling (12/12/05), I finally was able to talk with Miguel. He said I had a grounding problem. Eventually, their engineer, Joe, returned my call. Joe said that 120 volts on the chassis was not a defect. Although, he would not accept the unit as a return, he thought it was a good idea to return it to Amazon. Joe indicated that the unit must be grounded, and it would not be uncommon for an ungrounded unit to have 120 volts on the chassis.Appliances should never produce 120 volts on the chassis, even if the (center) ground post is removed. (Read for yourself; search for \"how stuff works 2 and 3 prong plugs\".)  Apparently, the unit has a \"hot\" wire touching the chassis. It seems the Joe (or Syntax) does not want to admit to a defect in the product.I recommend that you do NOT purchase the product unless you have a grounded 3-prong electrical outlet.Additionally, I recommend you consider their customer service. Call Syntax. See how long it takes to talk to a human. I called for one-half a day. They have an odd answer system. Even if you choose to \"talk to the operator\", you will have to leave a message. Eventually, I did speak to Miguel. Then, Joe called me. However, it took all day. (I first called at 8:00 PST; finally, Joe called me at 3:15 PST.)It's too bad. The unit seems to have good color. The sounds is a bit odd, but can be configured. It does not have good reception. On many channels received by my old TV, this unit goes to blue screen and indicates \"no signal\".If it were not for the defective (and dangerous design) and for the poor customer service, I would recommend the TV as a good value. However, I'm not risking my house, or my other electronics to this poorly designed unit.Check the voltage on your unit's coaxial (cable) input before connecting to you cable, least you damage other TVs or receivers on your cable.","Date":"December 12, 2005"}

I will admit that I was pulled in by the price and the reviews however it's not all it's cracked up to be. Out the box I found the picture and the sound to be rather poor compared to my Zenith Tube TV (which is about 6 or 7 years old I might add). After some playing around with the settings, I was able to improve the sound quality to a suitable level. The picture quality however was a different story. On full, 16:9, and panoramic the picture gets stretched. It only looks normal on 4:3 and even then the picture quality stays the same. The picture looks a bit \"washed out\" and doesn't perform well with fast moving images. I really wanted to like this TV. If not for the price then for the looks but after sitting in front of it for a few hours and playing some games on it, I have to send it back and use my old Tube TV till I find a new one...I gave it a 3 star rating only because it's still an ok TV for someone who just wants a TV.

I don't know where they got the comparison screens in their advertising, but the actual screen on my TV is very blurry, the color and contrast are nearly impossible to configure, and fast-motion imagery is choppy. Olevia Syntax has only been around for a few years--since 2003. And it seems like a fly-by-night outfit. They are making a big splash by dumping cheaper units and flooding the market with product that is only passably good at suspiciously low prices. But don't let the media frenzy fool you. This is a case where you really do get what you pay for (actually less). To top it off, customer service is extraordinarily inept. Rebates are not honored, and when you complain they ignore you. I wish I had gotten my TV from a reputable company that would not make outrageous claims and promises and then not stand behind its products or programs. It would have cost a little more, but when you're spending this much on a TV, what's a few more bucks to get something good?","Date":"July 27, 2005"}

I had been searching for a flat-screen TV that was reasonably-priced and had a good, sharp picture.  I compared this TV in a store to several others in its price range.  This was the clear winner.  It has a beautiful picture and great sound. (I am pleased that my TV has no dead pixels, either.)This is a monitor, not a TV, so you do need a cable box.  I have a digital HD box through Adelphia cable.  The HD channels on this TV are outstanding.  The persons on screen might as well be standing in front of you.  I have never tried to use this as a computer monitor, so I cannot speak to how it would work, but it is a wonderful TV.  And, despite Westinghouse's reputation for having bad remotes, the remote control on this TV works well.  It is very easy to switch from HDTV to regular TV.All in all, I am delighted.  My only regret is not having bought a larger Westinghouse TV -- but that would have meant paying much more!","Date":"February 7, 2006"}
{"Title":"Other reviewers don't do it justice","Author":"Agata","ReviewID":"R1VP5F5I17MFB8","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased this TV, and I am very pleased with it. I did not expect fancy features and surround-like sound, but a basic LCD TV that was inexpensive and expandable. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have a built-in HDTV tuner - that lets the price stay low (I will call up my cable company to upgrade to HDTV in a few days). Without HDTV, the picture quality isn't the best when you're close up, but with HDTV (as I saw in the store) it's just as great as the more expensive brands. The salesman told me how customers come back and complain about the picture quality, but this kind of TV is made to be used with HDTV (evident with the display model they had). The sound isn't bad - it's good enough for this price (for reviewers who complain about this - you get what you pay for, and if you want better sound quality, go for a more expensive model). My set has no dead pixels at all, and unlike what others said, the remote works fine. The menu can get a bit confusing to use, but it's manageable. The documentation is minimal, but you can probably find more info on it online. Overall, I am very happy for finding an LCD for such a low price (I went to J&R; for it - great service, the set is priced at $799.99 in store and $699.99 on their site, they were happy to give it to me for the online price). I recommend it for people who really want an LCD but can't afford one over $1,000. I'm looking forward to getting HDTV, and enjoying years with this LCD TV.","Date":"May 8, 2006"}

After some initial research last year, decided to waited another year to let the LCD technology mature and HDMI technology become common on TVs.This past 4 months, I looked at Sony 3LCD TVs and Toshiba DLP TVs very closely. Sony has good picture but did not have picture-in-picture in this years models and styling looked decades old. Toshiba's 1080P TV was very good with a ton of inputs and comparable pricing but somehow I did not feel comfortable with the Toshiba brand. My research indicated that almost all major brands have good picutre quality so the deciding factor came down to other features like inputs, pip and brandname. The picture quality in Best Buy and circuit city did not look close to what I get at home with a progressive scan DVD. For some reason, the stores want to sell Sonys more than anything else so they hookup Sony with best input and cables and leave Panasonic with ordinary cables making it look inferior.I have been a Sony or Panasonic brand customer so I decided to buy a Panasonic. For some reason, Panasonic does not have many LCD projection models and this was the only newer one in the 55+inch range. I was very impressed with the features ( sleek design, pip, inputs, sd card reader ) and price.I am an avid internet shopper but for reason did not feel comfortable making such a huge purchase online but the price difference between bricks and mortar shops to internet shops like Amazon compelled me to take a chance. The TV was delivered in perfect condition and they even set it up in the room of my choice. The TV design looked much better at home ( up close ) than in stores. It weighs a lot less than my old 27inch tube TV.HD Picture:I hooked a $20 HD antenna to the TV and boy, was I impressed with the picutre quality? Local HD channels looked lifelike. I just could not believe my eyes. This is using a co-axial cable and NOT HDMI. I am glad I did not fork over a fortunate for a Plasma TV because the HD picture quality is just as good as that of a plasma TV.DVD Picture:Make sure you get a Progressive Scan DVD player to enjoy good quality movies. The quality won't be as good as HD but it is very good. I used component video cables to connect my DVD player. I could see significant difference in picture quality between a regular DVD player with composite cables and a progressive scan DVD player with component cables.SD Picture:SD picture ( Dish network ) quality is more than satisfactory. It is not as good as my old tube TV but that is expected and I am very happy with the quality. There is even a significant difference in picture when connected using S-Video or composite cables. I just wish there was an additional co-axial cable input so that I can hook both the antenna and the dish receiver using co-ax cables.For now, I have not decided whether to upgrade to HD receiver from dish or wait because I heard that the output from dish network HD receiver is something like 480p and there are not a lot of HD channels available outside of local channels.I am sitting about 10-15 feet from the TV. I do not notice a lot of grainy pixels from less than 10 feet also although it is not wise to sit that close. HD picture look great from any distance.The remote is very easy to use. The SD card reader is handy although I noticed that it is better to view your picture on a laptop than on a TV. It is just painfully slow on a TV when compared to a computer. The SD card reader can be useful when you don't have a computer(laptop) handy.I have not used the PC input yet. I don't intend to use a 61 inch screen as a my PC input anyways.The TV does not look big in my family room as I suspected. The TV is much smaller than a 60inch Sony model and looks 100times better. It is a great upgrade for me and the details I could notice on this TV are stunning. As I said before, I love the HD picture on this TV. I watched a Pistons game the other day in HD and it was better than being in the stadium :) The detail on the big screen was just awesome. I watched the SuperBowl on ABC in HD with digital audio connected to my Bose surround system and it was simply a superb experience. HD picture is just as good as on a Plasma TV.Overall, this is a great TV. I am glad I purchased this over Sony.","Date":"February 8, 2006"}

With so many options available (plasma, DLP, LCD, etc.), buying a TV can be a head-splitting task. However, after considering what I want out of a big screen TV as well as my budget, I finally decided that this TV is the way to go. One drawbacks I read with LCD projection TVs is the \"screen door effect\" which is really obvious if you are sitting close to the TV. Since I'm at a comfortable distance away from the TV, I don't see this at all. Overall, the picture quality is awesome. I have yet to subscribe to HDTV (Charter Communications has a waiting list...sheesh!)...but the picture is excellent for standard TV reception. The picture is even better with DVDs and games (I have hooked up a Gamecube and PS2 to this). I think one of the reviewers below mentioned the price of the stand...yes, it is somewhat pricey...but you don't really much of an option since the manual states that this is the stand they recommend for the TV...and if you're putting down this much money on a TV, it's best to spend a little extra to ensure that the whole thing doesn't topple over. The Panasonic stand comes with features to prevent the TV from tipping over...or you can also chain the TV to the wall (I swear...this is in the manual).

In February, Comcast came out and pulled the 'not ready for prime time cable card' and installed a cable box. The TV's features were built around the cable card and the service guys told me they are nothing but trouble. The second tuner was defective from the factory so they put the lame one back in. By now it was April and 5 months after buying my new plasma I've had very little use of the features I paid for, So I got a hold of Panasonic and they told me about the jerk (Peterson) field service rep who plays God about who gets a new TV.

As far as finding one of these was almost impossible, Online retailers advertise a low 3500 dollar price but can never deliver on their promise. I got the run around for 2 months from east cost retailers and finally found one at a local dealer , ended up paying 1000 dollars more but at least its sitting in my living room all hooked up and running. Pay the extra money for the 500u over the panasonic 50px. It has more features and the stand looks much better. Dont be fooled into paying 3000 or so for another 50\" HD plasma! Good luck finding one. Andersons TV in Dublin, Ca has 2 left in stock.","Date":"October 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Panasonic TH50PX500 vs Samsung HP-R5072","Author":"Steve","ReviewID":"R385OEJTN2DAEB","Overall":"good","Content":"Initally purchased the Panasonic from Amazon.  I received it damaged, so I had to send it back.  They didn't have any left in stock, so I decided to purchase a 50\" plasma from a local dealer.  None of the locals had the Panasonic that I wanted, so I went with the Samsung HP-R5072.  I had the Samsung for 20 days before I returned it and purchased the Panasonic TH50PX500.All-in-all, the picture on the Samsung had a good picture, but it did not have near the picture clarity and color vibrance that the Panasonic has.  Additionally, this Samsung model has and \"electronic program guide\" - not to be confused withe the \"TV GUIDE\" version.  Needless to say, the Samsung version did not work and requires each channel to transit their program information and that just does not happen.  The Panasonic TH50PX500 does have the \"TV Guide\" version and it worked great.  Finally, the split screen cabability and integration capability with other Panasonic products put the Panasonic over the top when compared to the Samsung.  One last thing, the Samsung remote is very minimal as far as capability goes.  Panasonic has this beat hands down.","Date":"September 29, 2005"}

The Consummer Reports review sent me to the stores. I looked at every plasma set I could find and when I could watched them next to LCD and projection HD models. Every one looked good, the 500U looked better. Good quality DVD (Superbit Lawarence of Arabia or the Fifth Element for example) look terrific at 480P via component or HDMI inputs. Good as it was out of the box I tried a video tuneup disc and both DVD and HD movies were impressively close to film. and I bought locally at a specialty store so even with a discount from the general retail price in this area, delivery and painless setup were included. That is some thing to consider if you buy. The set weighs 114lbs. My wife gave my a hard time over the price, but the set looks good and is slim enough even with out a wall mount to sit tight against the wall.Negatives:Standard Def cable is not as good as on a CRT, especially if streched, but it is very acceptable six or eight feet back. It has only has one HDMI input.","Date":"November 21, 2005"}

I'm watching the local HD signals on rabbit ears - the picture is stunning. A lot of people I talk to are unaware that they can get HDTV without cable or satellite. Our market has a 24 hour PBS HD channel. I normally don't watch PBS, but they put on documentaries and travelogues shot in HD. You can't NOT watch it - not to mention the sports programming on the other over the air channels. I feed the analog cable signal thru my Replay TV. Looks great.For some reason I wasn't recieving the FOX HD channel. Was advised to simply reprogram all the channels and it came right back up.If you force me to find something to quibble about, here goes. I wish the remote had a CC button. To get it displayed, you have to go thru several clicks. For some reason the SAP channel has a remote button and not the CC. It's still a Great TV.","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

I did some extensive research on this model and virtually all the reviews were highly positive.  This Panasonic has the 8th generation plasma panel which is currently the state of the art.  To use an automotive analogy, \"You have a high end 8 cylinder engine running under the hood\".It really makes a difference, the blacks are deep in saturation and the colors are vibrant.  HD TV looks incredible on this panel and regular broadcasts are well defined. DVD's look great, so when HD-DVD comes out I'm sure the video will be awesome, you get very spoiled to the HD feeds after a while.  Mitsubishi and Pioneer both have equally high-end plasmas which rival this Panasonic, but there price is not in the same ballpark.

{"Title":"My first Plasma","Author":"J. Ibanez","ReviewID":"R126HD2YPPBTKX","Overall":"good","Content":"Three years ago, I bought my first big screen (sony 57\" rear projection HDTV).  A 34\" plasma at the time was probably worth the same price, so plasmas were never an option.  But now comparing the two types of technologies, plasma has improved so much and prices have dropped considerably.From what the salesman told me, this model runs off the 8th generation of plasma televisions, which is currently the latest technology.  Panasonic also slightly increases its blue pixels, which supposedly gives certain images a better feeling.  Also, when comparing multiple plasmas in the store, the black levels came out darker than on other tvs, such as while we comparing the letterboxes off the same source.  The only reason I did not buy from him was because they did not carry the 500U model, just the 50U.There was one store that had a 42\" and a 50\" 50U model side by side.  There I couldn't tell a difference in size, so if price was a factor I think a 42\" would have suited me just fine.The first thing I fired up on this TV was my Xbox with the component connections.  Of course the TV was set to vivid initially, but the colors were just awesome.Second was a Toshiba DVD player with up conversion through the HDMI interface.  Looks great but I can't wait for HD-DVD or Blu-ray to make its way to the market.I'm still trying to get a strong OTA signal but have many obstacles in my way.  I'll probably defer to Directv's HD service.I've also been looking up wall mounts for this 120 lbs monster (which by the way took two people take out of the box and secure on top of my table).  Sanus is currently my front runner on wall mounts, but considering its overall weight I might reconsider just a decent tabletop.I'd recommend this TV for the plasma users out there.","Date":"November 26, 2005"}
{"Title":"Quality Picture at a bargain price...","Author":"anzicco","ReviewID":"RDK6F9UT1H95N","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of the picture on this TV set. I have it hooked up with an HDMI cable connected to Comcast's (Motorola) DVR box.  Comcast has several \"HD\" broadcast stations, although true HD programming is still very limited.  I would suggest you program your own preferences (called MEMORY) rather than use one of the preset Toshiba setups which are either too bright (Sports & Movie) or too dark (Normal)  I have my preferences set to levels between the Movie and Normal settings and find that I do not have to change them too often.  I also have set resolution to 1080i, but will sometimes switch it to 540p on some analog stations or older programs as the interlace scan lines are sometimes very obvious and progressive scan works better.  Amazon claims in the product description that this set includes 2-tuner PIP, but I do not believe it does as there is nothing in the documentation that references this, nor do I see any PIP button on the remote or in the menu setup.**** UPDATE*****  I checked with Toshiba customer service and was informed that 2 Tuner PIP IS NOT A FEATURE on this TV set!!!  There are not 2 Tuners, nor is there any PIP!!!  They also informed me the set is manufactured by TOSHIBA in the USA and not Orion as some reviewers have suggested!*******While overall, I have a positive view of this set, there are some drawbacks:The 4 different theater-modes for the picture on analog/normal stations really distort the picture and/or cut off the top and bottom.  Full screen mode keeps all of the data at the top and bottom but people tend to have fat squishy faces.The TV does NOT have a Menu button on the set...so if you lose or break the remote control, you are stuck...there is no other way to choose source, picture size/quality, or other settings!  This is a major drawback!The Remote Control that comes with the set is supposed to be a universal remote, but it has no code for the Motorola box comcast uses, nor does it have any buttons for DVR controls, so it is necessary to keep 2 remotes around.I would also STRONGLY recommend you try to get this at a local store with their own delivery company.  The company Amazon used for my delivery was horrible.  I was NEVER directly contacted by the company when my set arrived in their warehouse.  I had to make a toll call 4 different times to finally get delivery over a week after the warehouse received it from Amazon, and 13 days After I ordered it from Amazon.com.  Amazon claims that the \"premium delivery service\" they use, for which you add $100 to the price, \"use protective equipment such as floor mats and doorjamb padding to prevent damage\"  There was no evidence of this when they made my delivery, and one of the two people sent was an older gentleman who had a great deal of trouble lifting the merchandise, almost dropping it a couple of times on the way up the stairs. They also DO NOT set up the TV for you.  They will plug it in and hand you the remote, and that's it.  If you do not know anything about hooking up, make sure you get it from a dealer who provides a set up service. Amazon also does not do any follow-up on how the delivery service was which is very surprising to me.So to sum up, I'd give the TV about 3 and a half-starsThe price 4 starsand Amazon delivery service 0 stars.","Date":"February 19, 2006"}

I got it at Best Buy for $899 and its picture is comparable to the Sony 32\" but is bigger at 34\" and about $200 cheaper and 60lbs lighter.  The colors are spectacular in HDTV especially sports and movies with progressive scan DVD. The reception you get really depends on the channel, some analog channel reception is better than others. I have digital cable from Comcast. The HDTV channels are awesome, I just wish there were more of them but I know in time there will be. I don't know why some of the other reviewers were knocking this TV, they must have bought a defective set.  My previous Toshiba 30\" lasted 17 years and I did a ton of research on this TV. I compared it to Sony, Phillips, Panasonic, Magnavox, Samsung and the picture on this TV was among the best out of all of them. The thing I liked about this set was the 34\" size,picture quality and all of the state of the art features which are too many to list.

When I first received the TV the picture was warped.  I called Toshiba to have it looked at (Toshiba support was freindly and helpful).  The local repair guy said it was a bad picture tube and that he needed to take it back with him to the shop for repairs.  6 weeks later I finally got the TV back and it still wasn't quite right, so I called the repair folks to come back out to my house.  Apparently they needed to recalibrate the TV 'for my environment.'That was the bad part of the story.  The good part of the story is that I am now happy with the TV and have been enjoying it for several weeks.  I am using component video for all input signals.  The picture looks fantastic when playing DVD's.  I wish I could say that the picture also looks fantastic for HD TV (coming from Comcast) but it doesn't.  It does look really, really good - but not fantastic.  Non-HD TV is acceptible.  For a comparison, I looked at a Sharp Aquos belonging to a friend of mine.  The Aquos has a much nicer picture quality than my TV.  However, my friend paid twice as much as I did and only has a 32\" screen.All in all, I have to say that I am happy with my purchase.  It was my first foray into HD and price was a major consideration.  I would consider this TV to be a very good TV 'for the money'.  Anyone who is limited to a sub-$1000 budget should definitely consider it.  However, if you aren't bound by a small budget or don't mind a smaller screen size I would look into something else.","Date":"November 28, 2005"}

I have my dvd player and Dish 921 HD receiver set at 480p with the TV upconverting to 1080i. This seems to be the best picture I can get and it looks fantastic, especially on HD channels. Whether or not it is made by Orion, Toshiba is responsible for their product and there is no conspiracy of Toshiba ripping of customers.

Schryer","ReviewID":"R3UND9Q260FRP","Overall":"good","Content":"If you currently have a conventional TV set with the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio but watch a lot of DVDs, you're probably tired of black spaces above and below the picture wasting much of your TV's screen size whenever you watch the widescreen movies which have become the norm on DVD. The cure for this problem is to get a widescreen TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This Toshiba is an excellent 16:9 TV with a very sharp picture. Also important, this is an HDTV set which is ready to display the dramatically improved picture quality characteristic of the new High Definition Television broadcasts to which all networks are rapidly converting and which are now available from most cable and satellite providers. Although this Toshiba's 34\" screen may not be as huge as projection TVs and some of the new thinscreen plasma TVs, it is still quite large. Furthermore, it's picture quality is equal to plasma TVs and better than projection TVs -- and its price is much lower. All things considered if you want a widescreen TV that's ready for HDTV and you don't want to break your budget to get one, this excellent Toshiba set may well be the answer.I note that several reviewers have advised against buying this TV, asserting that it is made by Orion for Toshiba, rather than by Toshiba itself. This is important because of the excellent reputaion of TVs built by Toshiba. I called Toshiba today and they asserted unequivically that this unit is built by Toshiba and not by any other company.","Date":"October 18, 2005"}

The price was good, it seemed to have good reviews, (although the sound system was nothing special), so we bought it from Sears.  We immediately noticed problems with the HD channels: intermittent vertical green and red lines, very dark areas on close-ups, and waves of light rolling up the screen.  Since this was our first HDTV, we assumed it was a cable problem.  Comcast came twice to the house, replaced the cable box, installed an expensive HDMI cable, and finally told us the problem was the TV. We called Toshiba and got the name of the authorized repair service in our area; they picked it up and spent 2 weeks trying to fix it, but Toshiba tech support couldn't figure it out.  We got the TV back, brought it back to Sears, and their repairman worked on  it.  He failed also.  They had one of the Toshibas left and let us take the new one home.  Out of the box, it had sound, but no picture!  Sears repair came to the house, decided to replace the entire circuit board.  We waited a week, the piece arrived, still no picture! Back to Sears, we found that they had just gotten one new Sony HDTV 34XBR970. It was going to be their floor model.  They felt so bad for us, they sold it to us at 20% off.  It is fabulous!  Very uncomplicated, gorgeous picture, great sound.  During the time we had the 2 Toshibas, I found that I really hated the set-up menus.  The Sony is much simpler and clearer to understand. The only drawback is that the Sony is about 3 inches wider because the speakers are on the side, so it hangs over the TV stand we bought.  But buying a new TV stand is a small price to pay after 2 months of misery.  BTW, the people at Comcast and at Sears were wonderful.  Thank you, Sony!","Date":"April 21, 2006"}

Unfortunately, these are no longer available, unless you want refurbished. A refurbished 34HF84/34HFX84 will cost more than a new 34HF85/34HFX85. That right there should tell you something.These are now outsourced to Orion in Thailand.

My other tv is a Samsung 50\" DLP, about two years old.The Samsung is in a totally different league. It's picture is dramatically better, sharp, clear and bright. I guess I was spoiled by the Samsung picture. The Toshiba seemed to get a worse picture than my old Mitsubishi.I called Sears and discussed the problem. They suggested that I schedule a Sears technician to try to tune the tv. The technician arrived and looked over the set. He told me there were no improvements that could be made by tuning or setup (as I suspected). After comparing to the picture on my Samsung, he said if he were me he would immediately return the set to Sears and trade for something else. He said that under these conditions they would probably give me full credit (it was only two weeks old). He helped me pack up the Toshiba, in the original box.Upon returning the set to Sears, I was informed that they have a new policy that any tv returned for any reason will have a 15% restocking fee, even if traded for another item. Sears has initiated this policy since combining with KMart. I was disgusted with Sears, but bit the bullet and paid the 15%. I plan to keep the tv quite a while and don't want to live with a lemon.

Toshiba won't help, my dealer won't help, and even an extended warranty coverage from Best Buy wouldn't help.  They still make you wait for the part from Toshiba before trying to replace it.  When it worked, the picture was great using my Comcast HDTV receiver. It used 1080i - if you are having trouble displaying that signal, you should call for warranty service.  Look to another brand, don't buy from Best Buy and don't buy the extended warranty.Update 13-Feb-2006: After a 45 day waiting period (part was not available), Toshiba faxed a return authorization to Best Buy.  The Best Buy manager was friendly and helpful, and we asked for our money back - and got store credit.  Since we had missed the College Football bowl games and Super Bowl, we'll probably wait until fall to make our TV purchase.  Maybe by then there will be 32 or 37 LCD's in a similar price range.

As you may know for the last few years the big screen Toshiba televisions have been produced in house by Toshiba - generally getting high marks on quality, picture, etc. while the smaller units were outsourced to Orion. Orion produces various electronics for any number of companies (they build it, and stamp someone elses name on it) which usually end up with middling to poor quality reviews.Well guess what, welcome to the start of outsourced big tube TV's by Toshiba. This is the new wave, poor quality Orion produced big Toshiba with nothing more than the Toshiba name stamped on the front of the TV and the remote.So forget everything you have heard in the past about the large tube Toshiba's being a safe bet. This TV now falls in the ranks of all the other low end junk being cranked out by low wage, cut corner, sweat shops.There is a reason the 34HF85 came out, replaced the 34HF84, and the price dropped by hundreds of dollars.

{"Title":"Good all-around","Author":"Andrew Pleasants","ReviewID":"RDVRDOIZ24KIQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV as a do-it-all device. I wanted to get a FP LCD monitor for my computer, and I was looking into panels that had multiple inputs. I wanted to be able to use it to play games and watch DVDs as well be able to use it for my computer. I figured while I was at it I might as well equip myself with something that can handle HD signals and I can watch tv on as well. The following is my take on its performance in said areas:PC:As a computer monitor it works very well. I am EXTREMELY picky about this type of thing and I wouldn't say it was good if it wasn't. I use it primarily as a PC monitor and I would rate it's pc performance a 4 out of 5. To get the best picture you need a decent video card and a decent VGA  cable(read: WUXGA or UXGA and some cases SXGA because of the high resolution of the panel). DVI->HDMI does not display well, you can use it in a pinch, but it will not look right, the tv was not designed to use this as a pc input. VGA works just fine, but you have to be sure you enable your resolution to match the native resolution of the monitor (the same is true with ANY LCD FP if you want the best picture quality). The native resolution of the panel is 1366x768... you can enable 1360x768 and it will chop 3 pixels (you dont lose any visual data, it just doesn't use these pixels) off of each side. Look for a program called \"powerstrip\" if you can't get your desktop to accept that resolution by default. If you choose not to use a widescreen desktop, then set the monitor picture size to 4:3 instead of Wide and use a desktop resolution of 1024x768 (the height of 768 ensures that you are still using native pixels). If you have trouble getting games to run at 1360x768 this is also a good option (set the game res to 1024x768 and change the picture size on the monitor).The picture quality is crisp and clear. There can be some very minor \"ghosting\" effects around certain colors/texts which can be aggrevated by a poor quality VGA cable. For the most part you will not notice this unless you sit extremely close to the panel or you display odd color combinations (i.e. fine bright blue text on a black background blurrs a little bit). As I said, I am extremely picky about this type of thing and if it was bothersome enough to return the monitor, I would. As with most LCDs it favors red a little bit and sometimes there can be a bit of boldness/bleeding on strong red in tight spaces (like a bright red bolded font).As far as pc games go it performs beautifully. Games are crisp, vibrant and clear. Best of all there is no response time \"ghosting\". This is something I was very concerned about because I play a lot of CS, BF2, etc. This monitor responds just as quickly as my CRT. I noticed absolutely no ghosting.Note: Most games today have command line options to set their resolution to special/custom sizes. The widescreen res you are looking for is 1360x768. Some games (like CS1.6) do not specifically support 1360x768 but do have wide aspect resolutions that still work well, but there is slight interpolation using non-native resolutions that will cause things to look a little different (still very very playable). And if all else fails you can always use 1024x768 and set the monitor to 4:3.Games:When not using it as a pc monitor I use it mostly to play PS2 and Xbox. I purchased component cables for both (which I would highly recommend) so I will comment on that.Both systems are very crisp and very clear. There is NO ghosting whatsoever and I read that others had problems with delay in response and lag between input and action on-screen. I have noticed no such thing. Again, I am extremely discerning about this type of thing and if that were the case, I would have returned it. Perhaps they had faulty panels or were using odd input sources. As far as component goes, they play VERY well. Again I would rate this 4 out of 5 because I have noticed a strange problem with PS2 displays. In certain PS2 games when there is very fine detail or there is some type of filter/mask/blur effect in the game, the panel seems to display it incorrectly. Its really hard to give an example, but its like if there is a blur effect on a shiny object, instead of the blur being uniform and fading, it has something of a checkerboard pattern. It is akin to trying to reproduce 32-bit color in 24 or 16-bit mode on a computer... it takes the two closest colors and checkerboards them together so that it seems like its one solid color. I have only noticed this in a handful of games, and even in those games it is usually restricted to whatever the softening/blurring effect is on. If you want a good example, pop in Final Fantasy Tactics for PS1. The game seems to have a full screen blur on it, I suppose to soften the sprites and make it more fluid. However, when using component cables (I have tried 2 different cables) the screen just seems to have a checkerboarded pattern instead of a fluid/smooth fading/softening to it. A minor gripe (except for in FFT since it takes up the whole screen) but a gripe none the less. I dont know if its the panel itself, the way the PS2 outputs to component, or perhaps just my panel. But I can say that I dont notice it on Xbox or on the pc. The only other game on my desk that I can think of that displays the problem is Mega Man X8 (which looks sweet in progressive mode, just hold down X and triangle as the game boots). Around some parts of the characters (easily seen on Zero's sigma blade) there is a shine/blur effect and it does the same thing.TV:I dont have HDTV or digital cable for that matter, so the standard signal is decent at best. Very watchable, but it performs like all LCDs do when using a non-digital/HD signal. No gripes.DVD:Crisp, clear and vibrant. I don't have component cables for my dvd player so I havent watched any in progressive scan yet, but via PC and PS2 (SCPH30001, no progressive) it looks fantastic (I think I actually prefer the PS2). I can only imagine it with a pro-scan set top.Bottom line:As long as your panel is in working condition and you have the right equipment for it, it makes a dynamite PC and videogame monitor. Thats the whole reason I bought it so I can assure you that I am very critical about those features. I don't know why other reviews are stating it doesn't perform in those areas when it does. Don't be shy of this model if you want to use it for a PC, games, dvd or a TV. It shines in all categories, its not extremely expensive and its about the perfect size as an all-in one without being too big a monitor or too small a TV. I recommend it.","Date":"October 10, 2005"}

I went home and looked online for the model and was able to find it on Amazon for $850.00 with shipping.  I bought it that same day and am glad I did.  The best part of this TV by far is the picture quality.  It's gives a nice crisp picture on any channel and handles fast motion with ease.  The only issue I have is that it doesn't provide wall mounts that will work with this model, so for now I have it on it's base.

{"Title":"Huge Difference Between LN-R238WA and LN-R238W","Author":"jegesq \"jegesq\"","ReviewID":"R31ZC1YB6XQB94","Overall":"good","Content":"The WA model is newer and is apparently being manufactured for those who really will not use their sets as a PC Monitor.  The \"W\" model is a bit older, and I'm not certain of its current manufacturing status, but there is an enormous difference between the two when using them with a PC.If you intend to use the monitor for a PC, be sure to only get the \"W\" model, not the \"WA\".  Pay attention to the labeling from the manufacturer on the box (and not the retailer's labels).  The \"WA\" and \"W\" clearly have different labels and they are indicated as such on the boxes.  Don't take the retailer's word for what they are selling either, because most sales people at the stores have no idea there is a difference.I first bought what I thought was a an LN-R238W (which turned out really to be the \"WA\" model instead) from a local Best Buy.Upon unpacking it and setting it up, I was very pleased with picture quality with both my HDTV set top box (Adelphia Los Angeles with a Moxie DVR).  The quality using the component inputs was outstanding for all the HDTV channels, and the quality was also excellent using a Samsung DVD player with the HDMI input (both the DVD player and the LN-R238W and WA have HDMI input).I encountered a problem however, when trying to use the VGA input from my computer. The native resolution for PC on the WA is 1280 x 728, which produced barely passable results with blurring of text and color pushing and bleeding around the edges.  Also the gamma and brightness were unacceptable as well.I was curious about why the PC monitor wasn't working as I had anticipated, but then I noticed that manual indicated there were two versions of the 23\" Samsung, i.e., the \"W\" and the \"WA\".  I had always assumed that there was only one model, and that I had purchased the \"W\" because that's how Best Buy was advertising it.The manual indicated that the resolution for the PC monitor with the \"W\" was 1360 x 768, which obviously is a slightly bigger bit of screen real estate than the resolution for the WA.  Not a lot, but different.  In fact, upon reading the manual a bit more carefully, it appeared that the only real true PC resolution for the WA model was 1024 x 768, which was way smaller than the \"W\" model's resolution.I tried the 1024 x 768 on the WA, and it was passable, but just barely and didn't display enough of the screen to be truly useful for me. Also, the text was still too blurry to be satisfying, and I was unable to correct the blurring and bleeding enough to satisfy me.  I also tried various other resolutions with the WA set, and could actually get it to go to 1360 x 768 using the NVIDIA drivers, but I just couldn't get the text to display acceptably without blurring and color bleeding.I then started to read the reviews here, at CNet, at Circuit City's site, at AVSForums.com, and anywhere else I could find reviews, and discovered that others had the same problem, and that there was really a difference between the \"W\" model (which I didn't have but wanted) and the WA model which I had been supplied with by Best Buy (even though they were passing it off as the \"W\").So, I decided I wanted to see if there really was a difference between the WA and the W models in real life.  I knew that Best Buy wasn't to be trusted, so I thought of other stores I could check to see if they had a true \"W\" model I could buy.  I figured if the W was really better, I'd keep it and return the WA to Best Buy (which has a 30-day return policy for TV's with no restocking charge).  So, I called a local Circuit City and verified they had a true \"W\" in stock (not \"WA\") and bought it, hooked it up and immediately noticed a stunning difference.Don't let anyone tell you that there is no difference between the W and the WA when it comes to using the set as a PC Monitor, because there is, and it's huge.The W is simply stunning, with bright, clear text, correct color and gamma, and that was without doing any calibration or adjustment, right out of the box.It is likely the case that there is no difference for use with broadcast HDTV signals or with DVD playback.  But if you plan to use the set with a PC, be absolutely sure you get the \"W\" and not the \"WA\" set.Now that I've got the correct model, I have to say I'd recommend it (the true \"W\" model) to anyone who wants to get a larger monitor to use with their PC as well as a solid LCD HD display for HDTV, DVD's and even SDTV.Of course, if you're not interested in the PC monitor function, then you can settle for the WA model and you won't be any worse for wear.A couple of other notes:  Don't even think of using the HDMI input for your PC display.  The VGA input uses true 1x1 pixel mapping (which is why the display on the W is so good at 1360 x 768), but like all LCD HDTV's the set employs a good deal of overscan with the HDMI (as well as component) inputs used to display HDTV.  This is acceptable for watching broadcast TV and DVD playback, but it doesn't work with PC displays.  Various people have tried to get it to work using Powerstrip (a very useful utility which allows one to design their own custom monitor timings for their PC to be able to use various HDTV's with either DVI inputs or HDMI) or the NVIDIA drivers.  It really doesn't work well, so unless you've got a lot of time and patience, don't even think about it.  You've got to use the VGA input which works very well.In my case, I have a dual display NVIDIA card and I use the Samsung as a 2nd monitor, to extend my desktop...But it's so cool to see the desktop really large, that I sometimes find myself using it as my primary monitor...Anyway, just be careful which model number you get if you decide to buy the 23\" Samsung LCD HDTV.","Date":"February 11, 2006"}

I use it for my bedroom as a primary PC monitor as well as cable and DVD.PC wise, although it doesn't have DVI input, its VGA input is already very good at 1360 x 768 resolution. It is comparable to my old Sony Trinitron monitor running at 1280 x 1024. It is also excellent for gaming (WoW). Btw, if you do plan to use it as a PC monitor, do spend the money on quality VGA cables. In the beginning I used a VGA cable bought from Bestbuy. For few hours there I thought LCD TV wasn't going to deliver the quality of pc monitor afterall. There was ghosting effect all over. I went online, ordered new cable UXGA ~$25. Problem fixed. The picture looks crisp, clear from then.For DVD playback, this Samsung is hooked up through monster component cables with Sony progressive scan. I wished I 'd bought a player with HDMI output, but it was before I have this Samsung. Overall the picture's clear and the color contrast is really good.I'm planning to get a HDTV box from my service provider soon. Regular digital cable TV looks okay, better than my sony wega though.

I thought the Samsung had the best picture and was $150-$200 less than comparable brands (Sony).  I looked for the best price on the Web, and found it for just under $850 at some internet sites.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was blown away.  It was around $850 from a Amazon (a reputable dealer), PLUS I could return it within 30 days if there were any problems.  None of the other Web dealers offered that.  So I ordered it, paid a paltry $16 for shipping and it arrived 4 days later in perfect condition.I set it up, hooked it into my HD cable box (ComCast) with component cables (I still need to get the HDMI cable) and tuned in a HD channel.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  It was far better than I imagined.  I tuned in Pulp Fiction on HD-HBO and could actually see the individual hairs on Samuel L Jackson's fro!

{"Title":"Best Bang for your Buck","Author":"Scott Lean \"strctskllz\"","ReviewID":"RZ7HNCFP12JM7","Overall":"good","Content":"First and foremost, this is the best TV you can get for the price.  After doing a lot of research on HDTV's I chose this one for my bedrooom.  23'' inches is perfect considering I live in a one bedroom apartment.  People I worn you to play close attention to the HD inputs TV's have.  With technology rapidly changing and retailers trying to sell older goods, make sure you purchase a TV with and HDMI input.  Don't settle for a DVI input because it's a must that the audio be wired seperately.  This may cause your video and audio to be slightly out of sync, especially when watching live events.  Though HDMI cables can be costly they carry both audio and video signals.  And, if you lucky like me, your cable provider allows HD cable service at an extra minimal cost.  This experience was truely plug and play, except for the mounting time, and hiding the wires in the wall.  I've never spent so much damn time watching the discovery channel.  The sports look amazing and even the non-HD channels look more crisp.  Its even more of a plus if you have TIVO or DVR, you can watch the same jaw dropping segments over and over again.One downfall this television does have is that many other manufacturers harness their HDMI ports to the motherboard with one or two screws.  Samsung doesn't.  The first TV I bought worked great, then the HDMI port loosened from the motherboard, and wasn't functional.  The TV simply wouldn't recognize I had my HD cable plugged in.  I suggest buying an extended service plan with any piece of electronics over $250, yes this also applies to IPODS.  We all know it breaks down to be about a dollar a day for the next three years, but it's well worth it.  I took my TV back to Circuit City, they exchanged it with no problem.  Unfortunately, when I returned it my brother bought a 42'' HDTV LCD and made me feel like a broke joke, but that's another story.All in all its worth every penny!!

I recently moved to Tokyo Japan, and given the small apt space that is the norm here, I settled on the 23inch version.What originally enticed me about this LCD was its exceptional picture quality.  This can been seen everywhere on Xbox360 kiosks.  The contrast ratio is great, and the brightness is just right.  Picture very sharp.I then researched for months, with regards to the usablity of this LCD HD TV as a viable PC Monitor.  I found the information on the Amazon reviews lacking on this topic, so I will address it here.I bought a new, high end SVGA cable to go with my purchase.  I wasn't sure if my old video cable was fine or not, but at <$10, I ordered it together with this LCD TV.  I would urge you to do the same.  Setup was a snap, I plugged in my PC to the LCD, and it just boots up like any other monitor.  The LCD displays MANY resolutions, NOT just 1388 by 768.  My video card actually doesn't do that resolution, but I am using 1280 by 768, and I'm very impressed still.  The images are crisp and sharp, unlike your traditional LCD monitors, where if you don't use the native resolution, the picture looks like crap.One more thing, this HD LCD as a PC monitor can also run many low resolution games.  I tried a few emulators, and I was blown away.  Old arcade games were using the entire wide screen even though the resolution was not at 1388 x 768 standard.  I was using MAME to test these games.  Final Fight, Street Fighter, it was like a theather experience to the blasts from the past!I love this TV.  Go for it.  $600-$700 bucks is soooooo worth it.I didn't really cover the Non-PC usage here, but the other reviews should cover that topic.

Yes, the resolutions are different, but that really has zero impact on the ability to reproduce hi-def images.  All you need for 720P hi-def is, you guessed it, 1280x720 resolution, which is what the R238WA delivers.  And would you really be able to see the difference in resolution between the 2 sets anway?  Doubtful since the R238W is not true 1080i so it would display at 720P as well.  You may have a legitimate gripe if you use this as a PC monitor, but if you use it just for TV, then it is a wash.  Plus, when I ordered mine for $750, the next closest price at a reputable location was about $200 to $250 more.  Is the extra resolution really worth an extra $200 if you won't notice it anyway.

{"Title":"Awesome TV but has an annoying quirk","Author":"Anon","ReviewID":"R229RCJ5ZKJN72","Overall":"good","Content":"First off - this is an absolutely awesome TV.  I wont go into all the great details - just buy it and you'll see!The only knock I have is the Timer ON feature.  We have DirecTV with DVR in our bedroom and our old TV had an alarm feature that allowed us to wake up to the morning news which we can't seem to live without.  I assumed that the Timer ON feature of this LCD would work the same way.  Unfortunately, you can only pick a channel (from antenna) and not another input source.  So, we wake up to snow and have to fumble with the remote and click the source button to DirecTV.  Also, I can't seem to turn this alarm off - I set the ACTIVATION setting to OFF but the TV still turns on every morning.  Anyone have any suggestions?I know I can just fork out some cash for a decent antenna to solve my problem but that just goes against all the reasons why I got satellite TV in the first place.  Its annoying but the positive benefits of the TV far out weigh my morning grumpiness at having to find the remote...","Date":"February 8, 2006"}

I recently ordered the Samsung LN-R238W and I unfortunately received the LN-R238WA.  I called customer service to explain the problem and the gentleman I spoke said they were the same tv.  I said no sir, thy are different models.  One has a higher resolution than the other.  He didn't understand this and said customer service will email me in a day or two to resolve the situation.  Now I notice the LN-R238W is not even listed on the site anymore, it has just disappeared and now I've got the wrong tv at the moment.  You would think they would have caught on to the fact that they have sent numerous people the wrong set. Now for the moment I have the wrong tv at an incorrect price.  The LN-238W was $799.99 and the LN-238WA is $749.99.  Guess which one I paid for.And for Mr. Harms, I did plan on using this as a pc monitor sir.

{"Title":"Perfect for your XBOX 360, but...","Author":"David Goebel \"Tech Muppet\"","ReviewID":"R3PVOKOOWNSVRA","Overall":"good","Content":"UPDATED POST 2/21/06:Last night I encountered my first \"dead\" pixel. Noooooooo!  You have got to be kidding me! Arghhh! I had heard the rumors, but unfortunately I am now a statistic.  I have the Samsung LNR238W, so I pulled up the Samsung website and searched for their policy on dead pixels and this is what I found...One or two dead pixels out of the approximately 300,000 to 1.3 million pixels on a typical LCD television is normal. Generally, then, if you have only a few dead pixels, service is not an option.With that said, what we do about an LCD TV with dead pixels depends on:The number of dead pixelsThe location of the dead pixelsThe color of the dead pixelsThe size of the LCD TV screenI then called Samsung and I was told that the tolerance for my 23\" size LCD was 17+ pixels.  Needless to say, I am not very happy about this.  The single \"dead\" pixel is actually white in color and does not affect my gaming.  But I do see it when I am at the COD2 menu screen.  It's not that big of a deal, but the fact that this is not even covered under warranty is a little irritating.  Right now I am not sure whether I should hope that I don't get any more or that I get at least another 16 within the next 11 months.  Words to the wise for all of you LCD shoppers... check the manufacturer warranty on defective pixels!MY ORIGINAL POST:I did not want to take a chance with getting the \"A\" model, so I picked up this set from my local brick and mortar store. I did send an email to customer service and they said that they have resolved this issue; however I still did not want to take the chance.I specifically got this set for my XBOX 360 setup that I have in my computer room. In the end, I picked this tv because it had the following specs:1) Quick 12 ms response time2) Outstanding picture and Samsung quality3) 23\" because this is big enough for sitting up close to (3-4 ft)4) Speakers are under the screen which allows me to put my surround sound front speakers on the sides of the tv.5) The unit is tall enough that my center surround speaker can be placed in front of the tv and it does not block the viewThis tv passed all of these criteria with flying colors. I would also say that the built in speakers sound pretty good to me and if you are not in need of surround sound these should work just fine for most folk. The picture produced by my XBOX is outstanding: nice and crisp, great vivid color, a real joy to play COD2 on! This tv also looks wonderful just sitting on my desk. When my mother in-law saw it the other night the first word out of her mouth was \"BlinG!\" She just loved the way the tv looked just sitting there in the \"off\" position. And then when I fired up the XBOX and she got a look at those lovely menu screens I think that sold her on this set.As for watching tv, I can say that this is the best LCD out there. It does a great job with regular broadcast signals in both clarity and stretching a normal 4:3 picture. The Samsung stretches in a way that does not noticeable distort the image like most of the other brands do, including the more expensive Sony Bravia line. In regards to the size, this is perfect for me since I am sitting fairly close and playing games. However, if you are planning on sitting on a couch and watching from a distance you will probably want to go for the 26\". I would recommend that you measure the distance that you will be sitting from your tv at home and then go into your local store and watch the different screen sizes from that same distance (it doesn't matter what brand, just find out what size you will need before shopping brands). You may find that you need to get a larger screen, like a 32\". This process can be long and painful as it took me months (literally) to decide on a size and brand.As for my little 23\" Sammy, I could not be happier. If you need a 23\" LCD HDTV you will not be disappointed with this little gem! I highly recommend one especially if you are gaming with a 360.","Date":"January 17, 2006"}

I really disappointed after read manual. Samsung 23\" LCD TV has two different models. I think most people don't know about that. There is R238W(Resolution 1366x768) and R238WA(1280x720).Amazon selling R238WA, but they listing model is R238W. I think they ordered cheaper model from manufacturer and selling with higher resolution model name on it. (They changed later)Next day I called Amazon and asked to replace it, but she didn't recognized R238WA, anyway she offered $100 discount when I keep this TV.(not bad)But I was denied because my feel is not as good. After two hours later from end of call I got email from Amazon, about my new TV has already shipped out by second day air. WOW! very impressed. Even first TV is still in my living room. I was called Wednesday and Friday morning received replacement.Excellent customer service! Anyway disappointed again they sent same model again. I called and asked refund, I already printed postage-paid return shipping label from Amazon(I didn't open the box) and I return it tomorrow. I think they don't have #R238W model.Please anyone purchased this model #R238W from online store, please let me know which store has this TV. I think most online store selling #238WA(cheaper and low resolution) instead of #238W. I know that 1366x768 VS. 1280x720 video quality is not much different.(Just diff numbers)You can't find out this 238WA model from online search even Samsung home page.(very funny)Only find out from manual front cover and page 81.Sorry for the other story.Anyway I watched this TV two nights, and my experience of this TV is excellent quality and beautiful design.Picture is sharp and clear and nice touch from edge to edge and nice side buttons. On & off switch with melody option is good.This 23\"TV is large enough for 2-3 bedroom apt living room.When I installed this TV in my living room(2 bedroom). WOW!Feel is much larger than I thought.Remote control is simple and easy to use.But, one minus is (Anynet) function, (Anynet) means you can control your VCR and DVD player with your TV remote. But only available with Samsung brand. This is not big issue.I recommend this TV.This time I try to shop at local retail store.Sorry for bad English.Addition,Jan/24/06today I purchased this TV from Circuit city.Only paid $728. This week(Jan/22-Jan/28) Circuit city has big sale. This TV retail price is$999 but $100 price break and additionally 10% off on this TV, price tag is $809,I had 10% off coupon, I paid $728 plus tax total paid $765(best price ever at retail store}. Go hurry sale end this Saturday.But be carefull they have #238WA too!First time Circuit city staff brought #238WA, what a disappointed and I went to salesman and explained about what is wrong and he check the computer and went to back, few min later he brought #238W. I am lucky.So, you must check the serial number before take it to home.I really satisfied with this TV.Great quality and beautiful design.Highly recommend!Amazon has just model number changed but TV description is not changed.(This TV is diff resolution)","Date":"January 13, 2006"}

{"Title":"An awesome HDTV: perfect for gaming","Author":"Peter","ReviewID":"R14TTBAWFNXDCI","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this Samsung LNR238W to serve all of my gaming needs.  It met my all my expectations and I give it my highest recommendation.  The following are my experiences while testing for problems.Pixel Response Time/Ghosting: Nonexistent.  I tried 480i signals through component, s-video, and composite and this lcd is just as responsive as a crt.Input lag: Nonexistent.  I heard of a problem that some hdtv owners(50\"DLP for example) experienced where there is lag or delay between the time they input a command on a game console and the time action appears on screen, due to video scaling or upconversion.  This problem would also manifest itself as unsynchronized video and audio when watching movies.  I was worried about it, but extensive testing showed that this monitor is free of this problem.  I tried Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for N64 (composite), Wave Race: Blue Storm for Nintendo Gamecube (s-video), Ninja Gaiden for Xbox (480i and 480p through components), Need for Speed Underground for Xbox (480i component), and Tekken 5 for PS2(480i component) and they all were responsive and fine, no problems.  Video was perfectly synchronized with the audio, which I ran through my hometheater system.Dead Pixels: My monitor didn't have any.Uniformity: My monitor didn't have this problem.  Colors appear as they should throughout the whole screen.  That is, there aren't any spots where red things show up green, for example.Quality of scaling: Solid image-wise, and no processing lag.  The video of non-native resolution signals that lcd's display are typically lower in quality than that of scaled signals on a crt.  However, this hdtv scales pretty well compared to other lcds, and I am completely satisfied with the image quality while I watch 480i/p video.  There is some noticeable pixelation and sharp edges sometimes on scaled 480i/p video, but that is to be expected - a crt would smooth those things over.Image geometry: perfect.  No bending, bowing, or other distortion you almost always get with crts nowadays.  Straight lines appear straight.I don't have a spare vga cable or an xbox 360 yet, so I haven't tested native resolution signals, but I'm sure they'll be excellent, I've seen xbox 360 running on this monitor at retail kiosks and the image is great - it's just a matter of whether a particular unit of this model is normal or not.As for the one review that mentioned input lag, maybe he reviewed a different tv by mistake, or had a defective unit, or was running his console through a pc tv tuner card through to the monitor or something unusual like that?  I don't know.This hdtv kicks butt.  By the way, this is the monitor that Microsoft chose to use in all their retail kisoks - so if you go to bestbuy, circuitcity or EB the xbox 360 is using this model.  Microsoft has confidence in this tv.","Date":"November 30, 2005"}

It couldn't handle the fast action of the 1991 classic Sonic the Hedgehog via Sonic Mega Collection... it made it look worse than on a 20\" Magnavox. It doesn't just blur 2D games either. The problem was also noticeable in Radiata Stories for the PS2 where anytime the character was moving the background blurs which doesn't happen on any other television in the house.I give it a one star for gaming.

{"Title":"OK for TV, poor for computer.","Author":"briankangaroo","ReviewID":"RLLY8NGX0AZW0","Overall":"good","Content":"I returned this unit. I had purchased it for use as a computer monitor with TV Pip. While it does do this, it's performance as a computer monitor was unacceptable.The entire color range was off with no adjustments available. Red was off the charts and so bright, reading text in that color was actually painful for my eyes.The other problem involved a blurry image. With some CRT's it's possible to align the R, G, and B signals on screen to get a crisp image. It seemed like this monitor needed that sort of tuning ability. There is one slider adjustment that addresses this 'focus' problem, but even at it's optimized tuning, the image had a blur.This monitor worked good as a TV tuner. One problem though. While you have the ability to change between WS and 4:3, the documentation gives you the caveat that using it in any mode that places black bands on the screen runs the risk of causing screen burn in. That must not be an issue related to this product, but something to consider when purchasing a new flatscreen TV.I'd purchase this unit in the future if these bugs were worked out as well as an automatic signal detection mode to eliminate having to manually swich formats for different uses.

{"Title":"Value Priced But You Get What You Pay For...","Author":"Annonymous \"An Honest Reviewer\"","ReviewID":"R3LBM56YCBIXHJ","Overall":"good","Content":"Cheap and value priced: About $200.00 retail less than comparable LCD TVs but you get what you pay for.Decent picture: However, you MUST use the video or component inputs to get a good picture. The \"ant\" input is horrible and will show every flaw in your cable connection. I did not see anything wrong with my tube TV until I replaced it with this one, then I immediately saw ghosts and noise. I ended up replacing my cable run to the bedroom with quad-shielded cable and upgraded my splitters from standard cable to the digital bandwidth variety which provided the increased bandwith that is necessary to provide the best possible digital cable reception (there's also splitters designed for HD as well). I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that your \"splitter\" matches your type of cable service (e.g., standard, digital or HD) to receive the best possible picture from your new set.  In addition, the viewing angles are extremely limited. You must be \"dead-on-center\" to get a good picture. Even the slightest deviation (from center) will \"wash-out\" the picture. In my case, that's not a problem because my TV is viewed from a fixed location in the bedroom and never have a need to look at it from an angle. And finally, this TV must be viewed from a reasonable distance to get a flaw-free picture (even with a pristine cable connection). From what I've read, LCD TVs are not as good at processing quick scene changes and sometimes the lag is noticable; however, at the proper viewing distance, those lags become tolerable. In my case, I had to push the new LCD TV back an additional 2 feet (from where I had my 19 inch tube set) to get those lags to a tolerable level. This TV has a 12ms response time and the better LCDs have an 8ms response time. I don't know if that makes a difference for TV reception but I do know that it will make a big difference if you attempt to use this as a PC monitor and one of your kids trys to play a top-end game. Also, I have heard that Olevia support is basically non-existant or difficult to reach so consider a supplemental warranty if available for a reasonable price. And finally, one of the most important pieces of information you'll need. To turn the TV \"on or off\" from your universal cable remote control, you can use the code for an LG brand TV which is \"0056.\"In summary, I can't make any final recommendations because I have no basis for comparison as this is my first-ever LCD TV. However, I can tell you that my wife \"loves it\" so I guess all the extra work \"paid-off\" in the end.","Date":"September 15, 2006"}

{"Title":"service / support problem","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R2CV7GDMFADAC7","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am rating this unit one star due to an on-going service/support problem I am experiencing with the unit.  After a year of very light use, the unit lost 1200 pixels - \"stuck\" on purple all the time. Manufacturing problems can occur to an otherwise good product, but the true test of a company, in my opinion, is it willingness to stand behind their product and resolve their customer's issue.  This is especially true with a new brand which has not yet established a track record.  To date they have been unwilling to work with me, but I am hopeful we can work it out - I'll undate my review then.Techically, the contrast range of this LCD is not capable of showing both deep blacks and highlight detail at the same time.  This makes movie watching a poor experience, but I've found it suitable for general viewing, children's cartoons, etc.Of course, once you loose 1200 pixels, the picture quality doesn't matter that much and you can only hope the company will support you!","Date":"September 19, 2006"}

But overall for a 61in TV very nice, The TV Guide function is cool now if Time warner would just give me a cable card I'd be setJust found out about a minor glitch, this TV is not quite ready for primetime HDMI, the HDMI input does NOT support pure digital audio (only PCM) the end result if you have a new dvd player that has HDMI out going into TV then out to AV receiver via optical out, only PCM (standard Dolby) will be output not Digital Dolby.  Now I know lots of people just run the audio direct from the dvd to AV Reciever anyway but this defeats my purpose of trying out the Samsung DVD950 so I can simplify life and use the Anynet function to switch to a DVD.  Bottom line the ANynet function leaves much to be desired and they probably should of just given you a programable remote with macros instead.  So if you have this tv don't waste money on a fancy DVD player with HDMI outputs, you can't tell the difference between component anyway :)","Date":"August 31, 2005"}
{"Title":"Beautiful picture...great price.","Author":"M. Simon","ReviewID":"R2Q5SQP36L62HS","Overall":"good","Content":"We just got this TV delivered on Feb. 4, and we are in love with the picture. Previous raters have said its \"not as bright\" as others in the same category; on the contrary, I find the picture quite bright. Also, I don't know what the one guy meant with the warranty not being good when purchased from Amazon. I registered my TV with Samsung and there was no trouble.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars has to do with Amazon's \"white glove\" delivery, rather than the TV itself. For $199, you're supposed to get \"knowledgeable\" delivery professionals to unpack it, hook it up, and set it up. Amazon tells you that you have to \"sign off\" on the delivery saying it is in perfect condition and then you cannot return it. The guys knew *nothing* about how to set it up (other than the electrical plug), so you pretty much have to decide whether or not it's perfect without seeing the picture. This is a pretty involved hook-up when you're connecting an HD cable box (with the three video cables) and the directions do not have examples of all scenarios. The delivery men were rather rude about my wanting to see the picture before signing off on the product.In short, the time for delivery was great, it appears to have arrived in great condition, but for $199, I expected to have delivery men who knew how to hook it up. Since then, I noticed that the link for more information on the delivery service is no longer working. You might want to download the manual and get an idea for the set-up before it is delivered, because you won't get help with the \"white glove\" service.","Date":"February 6, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good tv, works well, minor engineering flaws.","Author":"Randretti","ReviewID":"R2WWTOLYB0T3R2","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: Large, clear picture. Watching the tv show \"Lost\", the picture is absolutely stellar. Vivid, crisp images. There have been other HD programs that are not as impressive. I'm assuming they were in 480p vs 720p, but that's an assumption for the difference in picture clarity in HD programming. Xbox gaming has worked flawlessly, with no lag. There have been no problems with color wheel buzzing (as was reported on the hlp series), and I'm not a person who sees rainbows, thus, I haven't seen them on this tv either. The tv guide onscreen has been incredibly easy to use. It was functioning correctly the 2nd day.CONS: The engineering for particular screens is awkward. To use the PIP, you can hit 1 button on the remote to bring up a pre-programmed channel, but all you can do is turn it on or off. To surf, or change the pip channel, you must go through the menu and go through several screens, and then you can only select an analog channel. Also, the remote that comes with the tv does not allow you to surf a day at a time on the tv guide onscreen. I can only go hour by hour. You can use the search feature which works well, but I feel I should be able to hit a button or select a time to search for programming and I need another remote to do it. (The remote that would include cd/dvd controls for fast forward).SUMMARY: Those are my only 2 complaints and since they are engineering issues I have to recommend the tv. I'm happy with it and will keep it for years if it keeps working as well as it is. I've had the tv for about 2 weeks.","Date":"August 14, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best DLP on the market right now","Author":"A. Gornick","ReviewID":"R2ILGYWFOGM6B1","Overall":"good","Content":"At the time of my writing this (Nov 2005) I researched and viewed every DLP I could get to from Circut City, Best Buy, The Sony Store, and some local big screen TV shops.The Good:I found this Samsung to provide hands down the best DLP picture available. The picture is bright, sharp, and clear but of course is still subject to diminished quality when it is in direct sunlight or in a very bright room. I just close my blinds about halfway in the day time and it looks great. I can't help but attribute this to the fact that Samsung pioneered the DLP technology and they have had the longest amount of time to perfect it.I mainly decided on DLP as I am an avid gamer and DLP is a great choice for games as it has no possible \"burn-in\" at all (something both LCD and Plasma can suffer from). DLP is also an amazing value if you want a very large size screen.I've had this TV for the last 3 months now and am extremely pleased with it's performance. DVDs are a joy and appear extremely film-like and clean. Video games look fantastic with the 720p display bringing out all of the detail you would expect.The UI and remote are good and offer quick access to the features that you need with one press (like ratio switching).The TV has a very thin profile and looks great when sitting on the stand that is designed for it. The stand easily holds about 4 full sized components like a TiVo or Cable Box.The whole tv only weighs in at 120 or so lbs. I was easily able to lift this onto the stand with one person helping on the other side. It is extremely light for it's size.The Bad:If you are a big picture in picture fan you might want to look elsewhere, as the PIP option is locked to a second source, so you can forget browsing other channels with it. About all it is good for is keeping an eye on another source like your xbox or dvd.Summary:If you want a large DLP today you'll be hard pressed to find a better DLP picture on the market. If this review is a bit old however do look around and see what is out there. This technology is developing rapidly and advancements are being made by other companies all the time. If you have your eye on this set already, buy with confidence and know you're getting a quality and great looking product.","Date":"November 21, 2005"}

Imagine my surprise when a I found the 61\" model (hlr6167w) had been knocked down to the price I was prepared to pay for the 56\".The main reason I am writing this is to let everyone know now is the time to buy, these models are being discountined and will soon be replaced. I was able to get this TV for 1999.99, the new models will almost assuredly be close as twice as much.As far as the TV itself goes, it is amazing. HD on it is unbelievable, if you have seen it on display at a Best Buy or some such store that doesn't offer a true HD signal, you haven't seen anything.The Screen is vivid and crystal clear in a room full of light, there is practically no glare on the screen. Of course, it looks great in the darkness as well.I was a little worried about how regular \"low-def\" TV would look, but even that looks good.Most who pay this much for a TV will probably use surround sound but it is worth noting that, The sound is well above what I expected, as well.It's like having a movie screen in your home, and I could not be happier.I also, would like to thank everyone who takes time to review products both here and elsewhere.

{"Title":"Pretty.. Huge","Author":"Jonathan Kim","ReviewID":"R1K2LZ98AEE2ED","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is huge.  I was originally planning on purchasing a 50-55 inch TV at the $2K price range.  There is a lot of value in this TV.HDTV looks awesome.  It even looks better than DVDs playing through over the component cables.  This TV doesn't have 1080p support (it has 1080i though), but you're not really missing anything because most HDTV programs aren't transmitted higher than 720p (which this TV fully supports).  This TV also supports Cablecards if your cable provider has them available.The other semi-problem mentioned earlier was that there wasn't enough high end inputs (hdmi, DVI), and it's true though there are enough component inputs if you prefer that.  The Anynet function and TV Guide feature was useless for me, but it's always nice to have extra features.One of the neatest features is plugging my computer into the TV through the D-Sub (15 pin monitor) input.  Though some care has to be made so you don't accidentally set the resolution to something that can't be displayed properly on the TV.  It is pretty finicky when it comes to what resolutions can be displayed unlike a regular monitor.One other minor issue I had was the viewing angle.  The TV doesn't come with a stand, so some thought has to be put into the placement of this TV.  For optimal viewing, you want to be able to be eye level with the center of the TV.Overall, I am very satisfied with this TV purchase and recommend it as a very good DLP solution for those that don't need the 1080p or a lot of the higher end digital inputs.edit - The newer 61\" 1080p model (HL-R6168W) from Samsung might be more value for only a few hundred dollars more as of the prices posted on Amazon today (4.3.06).","Date":"March 30, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent value for the money!","Author":"R. Ocampo \"Artisan\"","ReviewID":"R3HQXN1EQO4Z7V","Overall":"good","Content":"Plasma technology is still the best in terms of brightness, contrast and physical dimensions. You can hang it on a wall and cramp it in tighter spaces.The other option would be an LCD screen, but the picture quality (artifacts) and price factor would make it an odd decision to go for when you could shell out a little more for a Plasma display. Also beware there are two types of LCD screens - LCD and LCD projection. LCD is the same as the computer monitors. Although it has greatly improved since it's introduction, it's still slow and expensive. LCD projection I would shy away from at the moment because it doesn't compare to DLP. Although Sony came out with a so-called \"3LCD\" technology to rival the high-end DLP 3-chip systems. Know that DLP was first for the 3-chip technology (for their high-end applications like major movie houses), it's not who's first as time will tell how each fare.Yet a good rival that has been hitting the market is LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon). JVC has renamed this HD-ILA and Sony came out with their own name branding - but they are all LCoS technology. Prices have yet to come down and is said to have none of the \"cons\" of LCD and DLP projection TV by exhibiting good blacks, great speed in drawing the picture and no rainbow effect. Until prices drop to competitive levels with the rest of the other products, this won't be on my list until next year.The next best option behind Plasma, IMO, is DLP by Texas Instruments. It gives the  best blacks and color rendition among it's class of projection televisions.How good is DLP? It was the first and no-brainer choice for commercial theaters that project digital movies (i.e. the first digital screening of Star Wars prequels). These are front-projection units that need a reasonably dark room to refrain from washing out the colors it projects to the screen. For personal viewing in bedrooms and living rooms, you need a rear-projection DLP. This encases the whole unit like a regular projection television, and is more kind to ambient light.A. The downside to DLP rear-projection monitors is:The amount of moving parts it entails to create the picture -1. A digital micromirror device (DMD) to reflect light in 1,024 different shades of gray. Because these tiny mirrors each move independently, there is a risk of failure.2. A color wheel that spins in thousands of revolutions per minute to help create the  color. The wheel bearing will eventually wear out and will need to be replaced by a technician over time. Furthermore, the noise created as it spins to speed is evident when you power up the monitor. Although any minimal audio volume will drown this sound out.3. The lamp (light bulb) that projects the image onto the screen, just like any other light bulb, has a usable life. Each manufacturer states how long their bulbs will last before it needs to be replaced. A typical life span for 4 hours of viewing each day will last around 4 years. The good news: it only takes to replace the bulb in order to bring the picture quality back to like new just as when you bought the TV. This is versus Plasma and LCD which lose their brightness over time (LCD rear projection also takes replacing the bulb).4. The amount of heat created by the lamp is enormous that you can't box the unit in a cabinet nor stick it's back side too near to the wall unless you want to increase wear on the monitor or create a melt-down.B. The upside is the picture quality you get. In fact the price you would have paid to get this kind of quality and usability over time is unfathomable you would be glad you didn't have to pay for Plasma (of course if you can afford a Plasma or need to hang it on a wall, then this is your only option). Just replace the bulb and you're good to go for another 4 years or so. You can't do that with a Plasma and re-charge the gasses. Unlike Plasma, it's brightness virtually stays constant throughout the usable life of the lamp. Samsung will warn the user when it is nearing the end.C. Physical dimensions enable you to lift the monitor alone. Try doing that to a CRT. Samsung's \"floating screen\" design enables the picture to give a good impression that the picture is on it's own space. However, the silver accent below the screen (although very elegant) does not fully take the effect into what they are marketing it to be as any light falling on the silver accent reveals the screen is not floating.With all being said, four stars for this monitor because Samsung gives us a lame manual that leaves the technical savvy people out of the loop and questioning for more information - despite the TV having one of the best picture quality and Samsung technology loaded into the monitor (enhanced picture processing and the abillity to fine tune the colors based on ambient light surrounding).Four stars because despite all the technology loaded, they give us one HDMI in socket that doubles as the old DVI socket care of your own ability to buy an HDMI to DVI cable. No FireWire audio input/output unlike other manufacturers. And only one digital audio output courtesty of an optical Toslink connection.The good part is Samsung's strict policy for defective mirror devices, strict manufacturing tolerance and elegant design which helps you trust buying their products more than other manufacturers.A word of caution to shoppers and owners of DLP and other technology that enable true high definition output: the reason for most bad reviews is their disappointment when watching with various low quality sources. They are mislead into thinking their picture quality will improve with these kinds of monitors. On the contrary a monitor of this caliber will show even more imperfections and reveal the low quality output that is being fed into it - garbage in, garbage out. Subscribing to digital cable/satellite isn't enough. You have to subscribe to HDTV and be viewing HDTV sources in order to see it's full potential. MTV isn't HDTV. Know which channels air in high definition. Discovery Channel HD (not simply Discovery Channel) is the perfect viewing sample.You want to maximize the input of sources by using HDMI/DVI cables. Don't use RCA or S-video jacks for this monitor. The least video cable you should use is component cable. Even that I wouldn't recommend because that would mean transmitting analog video signal from source (cable box, DVD player) to TV. Keep the signal pure and clean as possible by keeping it digital until the last minute.Lastly, this monitor's standard output is 720p (progressive) output. Other lower or higher sources fed into the unit will make it convert to 720p. This is helpful info into putting less strain or digital conversion and artifacting to the monitor - feed it 720p signal already so all the monitor has to do is output directly rather than do further processing.If you want the latest technology, this \"old\" technology isn't for you as there are already a handful of 1080p monitors in the market including monitors made by Samsung. If you're on a budget and want a bang for your buck, you won't make a mistake with this purchase and handing it down the line when  you're ready to make a step up into the future (for the same price you purchased this unit).","Date":"November 22, 2005"}

The picture quality is exceptional for HD channels and DVDs in the 480p mode(as good as any of the LCD TVs).  Performance on normal analog channels is fair to good compared to direct view TV performance on the same channels (both HD and analog are off cable).  Digital audio sound is excellent.  The setup and custom adjustment menus are easy to use but sometimes annoying as the menus have 4 to 5 layers.  The TV fits in a very small space for its screen size (width and depth are the smallest available for this size).  The manual is good but assumes you understand HD terminology and doesn't explain the difference in performance when choosing many of the settings.

I get a respectable 1280x720 resolution. But, to set it up, you need (1) HDMI to DVI adapter - $75, (2) DVI-DVI cable - $75, (3) dual monitor graphics card (Radeon 7000 - $50). Once cabled, the tricky part is configuring the DVI display, since you have to 'list all modes' and then choose 1280x720 resolution (Samsung's DVI interface doesn't provide this as a supported mode, but it really is)","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

Like the other reviewer mentioned, the measurments are absolutly spot on (which was very important as to fit in my entertainment center).  Set up was a breeze, the menus and on-screen displays were simple to follow and the picture quality is amazing.  As I shopped around, the biggest difference I noticed was how bright and crisp the picture was compared to other bigger, more expensive, DLP, plasma and LCD TV's.  This TV is in a very bright, naturally lit room, yet the picture quality is not affected much at all.  The DLP technology does what it claims, to produce a bright, crisp, clear picture.  I do not HD programming yet with my sat. provider, so some channels are a little grainy, but with DVD's and other digital sources, this TV is hard to beat.  From a quality to price standpoint, you can't go wrong with this TV. I would highly recommend it to anyone.","Date":"September 11, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best of all worlds and great price","Author":"Brian J. Joiner","ReviewID":"R3CG1HLGF5KVD2","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV has everything I wanted and for the right price.  It's very light (about 50 pounds), not very deep (maybe 14 inches) and the picture quality is outstanding.  Try watching one of the Pixar movies on it, you will be astounded and Discovery on HD is almost better than going on vacation. It's a table top DLP projection TV, so there are no pixels to burn out like LCD or Plasma, it fits on most TV carts, and the price was awesome.  Including shipping to Texas, I paid $400 less than what I would have paid in store because the retail price was lower, and I didn't have to pay sales tax.  It's simple to use, and only requires a bulb replacement every few years, much like a computer projector would.  There is one warning I can bestow, and that is despite showing HDTV content gorgeously, the quality on regular stations may \"appear\" to dip.  You get used to this, though and Samsung recommends hooking your cable/satellite receiver up to the TV using 2 connections (one component or HDMI, and one S-video, the latter helping with the picture quality of the non HD channels).  All in all, I am VERY happy with this TV.  Also, when there were some errors with the sale of my TV (shipping co lost the first one, and then Amazon sent me a letter that I had never returned the TV I never received) they fixed in within a day.  Amazon customer service ROCKS.","Date":"September 10, 2005"}

You won't regret it.Originally I wanted a 56\" DLP but after looking at the size on the monster in local stores, and where I was going to place the TV on an 8' wall, I opted for the 42\" model. The size is just right for viewing comfort without having to sit 20' away. The color is VIBRANT. Blacks are REALLY black, whites are brighter, colors are true right out of the box. The instruction manual is easy to read and understand. The functions on the remote are easy to use. I have a satellite dish and an outside antenna for local stations. The PIP is great for watching two sporting events at once.Set up is no sweat, very little to do even if you do it yourself. The few extra bucks for delivery was worth every penny. The unit was delivered when my wife was home alone. There'd be no way for her to off-load the TV and lug it into the house, uncrate it and set it up without help. The delivery persons did all that and even took the box it came in with them. Also, the price I paid thru AMAZON was the CHEAPEST I found locally and on the I-net.

Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it.The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player (<$150); the visual results were simply outstanding.Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables.So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite).

{"Title":"Turns out these were not built to last.","Author":"Anonymous","ReviewID":"R3MVODCPWXRGRX","Overall":"bad","Content":"Eight years or so into their lifespans, it's becoming clear that these puppies were not built to last, and under no circumstances should you buy one today.  Here's the deal.  When Samsung was mass-producing these (2005, mainly), they anticipated that the lamp would be the first part to go--and most comments on here from that time point out that you'll have to expect to replace the lamp within a few years.  Well ... you'll be lucky if it's the lamp.  There are several other parts that could fail, including the lamp ballast, the color wheel, and the DMD board, and you'll have NO way of knowing which it is, because the television's error lights will not tell you.  A Samsung tech admitted this to me over the phone: they just weren't thinking ahead, because they expected the lamp to be the only part that the consumer would have to replace.  But do an internet search for any of the parts that I just mentioned, and you'll find plenty of unhappy Samsung owners complaining that their TV has stopped working and they can't figure out which part is to blame.That's what happened to me too.  The TV started shutting off, with the little error lights blinking to indicate that the lamp was defective.  So I replaced the lamp ($150 with shipping, if you buy it online from Samsung), and, lo and behold, it didn't fix the problem.  Now there's no way to know what's wrong except by replacing each part one at a time, and that can add up to about as much money as you'd have to pay for a nice new 1080p HDTV today.  Not to mention all the time and aggravation ...I regret this purchase and frankly will think twice before buying from Samsung in the future.  I did not expect that a high-end television from a respected manufacturer would have such a short life.","Date":"April 9, 2013"}
{"Title":"Good buy, quality product.","Author":"Gift Card Recipient","ReviewID":"R2WEBZXUM5HU6R","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this TV shortly before Christmas at the sale price (which was amazing) and at first I was extremely uncertain about it.  A 42\" TV with new technology for such a low price seemed a bit strange, and I had somewhat of a hunch that maybe they were dumping them off at a low price because of poor quality.  That has all since subsided.However, when I first received the television the FIRST DAY of usage I had a big problem with it.  After a few hours of usage the TV shut off by itself.  I had originally thought that I may have laid on the remote control, so I turned the TV back on to only have it shutoff again about 30 seconds later.  I noticed the lights in front of the television flashing, and having remembered seeing something about that in the manual, I looked to find out the bulb is defective.  This seemed to confirm my aforementioned fears, and so I immediately called Samsung to have a repairman come fix the thing.  A defective bulb is no big deal, but annoying nonetheless.  Well needless to say, I don't like their method of appointments, they put in a \"ticket\" and then have someone call YOU back to make the arrangement.  It took them almost 5 days (including saturday and sunday) to call back, and the appointment was 10 days from the day I arranged it.It was a definite inconvenience to have a large television sitting in the middle of a room completely unable to function, but taking into consideration that it was the holiday season, I suppose it can be excused.  The repairman came mid-morning, took his shoes off at the door, was quiet and polite and immediately went to work on the television.  He left no doubt in my mind that he was an expert at what he does, and after replacing the bulb realized there was a problem with some internal component so he replaced that as well.Although it was an inconvenience to have to go through that process for the television, I couldn't be happier with what I paid for it and the resulting picture.  I have the TV connected through a Monster Cable HDMI (if you want top of the line, go with Monster even though its extremely pricey) with a Comcast DVR-HD box.  Sports are clearly the superior quality, but the overall quality of the HD channels is amazing.  I also have a Playstation 2 connected through the component cables and it looks  just as good considering its not an HD output.  But if you are going to connect a non-hd system (xbox, ps2) I suggest getting the component cables because using the RCA plugs was horrid, blurry, and not even worth playing.Beyond all of that this television was a great buy, and even though the price has since gone up its still not THAT bad.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but to me 5 stars would be a 1080p output.  If you're looking for a good TV for a decent price, I'd say this is definitely it.","Date":"January 10, 2007"}

(New Color Wheel) its called the HL-S4266W which has a new Color wheel.Upon first reading about this TV i was a bit skeptical. The whole \"The Shell on the bottom of the screen when your seeing black on the scrren.\" First of all you do see a little what looks like a white shell on the bottom of ths screen. However is is barely noticable unless your trying to pick it out (Had my friend try to find something wrong with the screen when it was all black and he had problems finding the \"Shell\")When i was buying a TV i needed one that was less the 40\" in width because my wall unit is only 40\" wide. So i was looking at a lot of Plasma's and LCD's but all of them were around 41-45\" because of the side mounted speakers. This TV however was 39.3\" wide which fit perfecly in the space. At first i hooked up my Xbox360 to the system with my friend and booted it up. The TV makes a chime sound which is a little catchy but not positive nor negitive in my opinion. I get to the Xbox screen, set it for 720P/Widescreen. So i start playing a game and my first reaction was it looked like crap compared to my Sony 60\" WEGA Tv. After my friend left I was looking over at the Xbox and figured out that the video cable was switched to EDTV instead of HDTV. When i switched it to HDTV i saw a HUGE differnce. The picture was really really sharp and the TV is VERY bright which is good for movies and games. I am really happy with the purchase of this TV and i would reccomend it to anyone that is looking for a good cheap Hi-Def TV.Pros: - Looks amazing if you feed it a High-Def source. - Very nice and bright if you want to play games or watch movies. - The interface is very clean and neat. (Not importaint but i like it) - It is a very nice looking TV compared to some others i saw at Bestbuy. - I like the speakers at the bottom of the TV. It gives the screen a very clean and nice cut.Cons: - This TV brings out details from bad sources such as a standard DVD Player (I would just purchase a Upconvert DVD Player which outputs to 720P and you will have a amazing picture) - The Bulb will burn out in about 2-4 years (Depending on use)","Date":"November 23, 2006"}

My first bad decision was to purchase any HDTV before I had a digital signal. What stores or manufacturers won't tell you is that the analog picture is surprisingly poor; not as good as your old tv picture. Consumer Reports will back this up with the black circle ratings (poorest quality) for the best of plasma, LCD, and DLP hdtvs, but I received that info a day later. I owned the Samsung 42\" hdtv for just one day and returned it to BestBuy ( they were running a special with a price very close to Amazon's) and may buy later this year after  I get digital service (and a probable Samsung hdtv price drop).

I bought it for \"no screen burn\" when viewing 4:3, for the fact that the picture looks better then most other DLPs, connections and of course price when compared to LCD and Plasma.  Overall, great piece of equipment, speakers are truly exceptional. We have had it for about 2 years and the brightness seems to be fading, quick adjustment and it looks like when new. Though, be sure to buy the extended warranty-the mirror device that spins to produce the picture shattered right after warranty expired, but we bought an extended warranty (for the bulb replacement option, priced at $400 per bulb when we purchased) and I am so happy we did.  After the replacement, there are artifacts as I am sure due to the glass shattering into a million pieces inside the box.

Don't forget that you'll have to replace the $250 bulb in this set every couple of years and that it is about a foot thick.I'm personally very happy with the picture and it made more sense from a price standpoint when I purchased it. However, if you look here, you'll see bigger 46-inch Samsung DLPs for the same price (if your room will support that) and even the 50-inchers are only about $150 more; that is 150 well-spent dollars.","Date":"January 5, 2007"}

We were pleased with the look and feel of this TV, but the picture did not live up to expectations.We are on satellite but do not have an HDTV tuner yet. The channels looked grainy and had weird pixel movement in the dark areas. We were able to get the color and contrast just about perfect with some minor adjustments, and the sound was great. We realize that DVDs probably look much better, but on a day to day basis we don't watch DVDs, we watch regular TV.The picture looked awesome from across the room, but when sitting on the couch about 6-7 feet from the screen, it really didn't look that great. We explored a few more options in the stores and finally opted to return this TV for a slightly better price on a plasma.Bottom line is, the TV is probably fine if you have the right setup, but for us it just wasn't the best choice.","Date":"October 19, 2005"}

The picture on this TV is clear, bright and lifelike, and the images are eye-popping. DVD's are amazing, even in 480P. I'm using the DirecTV HD TiVo as my satellite source, and an over-the-air antenna for local HD channels. DirecTV's HD choices are limited, but the picture on those (compressed) channels is beautiful. But the piece-de-resistance is the non-compressed local HDTV broadcasts. Just amazing. Our local CBS affiliate does their news in HD, and it makes the boring local news riveting just for the picture. Getting strong signals from an antenna can be challenging, but it's worth it if you can do it.The set has more options than you'll ever need, but I particularly like the surround-sound simulation mode that plays a simulated 5.1 image over the set's 2 speakers. It actually creates sounds that seems to come from behind you. Of course, you can hook it up to your home theater for the real thing (over an optical connection).I have noticed no rainbow effects that some say appear on DLP's, and the picture is plenty bright, even in my room that has a wall of windows behind me and skylights above me.In short, if you can afford this TV, you shouldn't hestitate to buy it. Amazon has a great sale on it now (July 2005), so it's even less painful. Besides, amortize it over the 10-15 years you'll enjoy this TV, and it's a bargain.","Date":"July 2, 2005"}

This will reduce \"lag\".  You cannot use the S-video or the Composite inputs...if you do you will experience lag.For new TV's that are built after June 2005 Samsung added a video game mode function to the TV that enhances video gameing.  These TV's have no issue what so ever.  So don't be agraid to buy this TV - it's the best DLP in it's class - perhaps in any class. I compared to Mitsubishi, JVC, and Toshiba.

{"Title":"GREAT T.V.","Author":"Robert Soltz","ReviewID":"R4889X5E0Q3ZG","Overall":"good","Content":"I probably spent 60 hours researching this TV.  During my research I learned about a few possible downsides; the DLP chip is not the newest, greatest version. Picture quality when going through a digital cable box, in the lower 100 channels is not as good as higher numbered channels or when the cable is connected directly. The PIP controls are awkward. But the pros far outweighed the cons. I ordered the set.The picture, especially in HIDEF is unbelievable. If you like PIP you can actually watch the equivalent of two 32\" simultaneously.One thing I really like about DLP is that there is no worry about picture degradation or burn in.  I also own a LCD TV.  That sets owners manual states not to watch shows that don't fill the whole screen more then 10% of the time.  I don't like having to \"zoom\" pictures to fill the screen.  With the HLR56687W, it is a non-issue.  Those shows that don't fill the entire screen are still plenty big, and because of the design of the TV I usually don't even notice that they are not wide format.Amazon.com was $500 less then Circuit City on this set. Also  Amazon.com only charged $149 for delivery and setup.  Almost all the other internet sites selling this set wanted between $215 and $300 for delivery \"to the door only\".If you are looking for a large screen TV, BUY THIS SET, you will not be sorry!","Date":"August 25, 2005"}

It faces a couple of big windows but we still get a bright, beautiful picture during the day.If you need a wide viewing angle on your tv or want to mount it on a wall, go with plasma instead.

I considered the plasma's and the LCD's, but this TV is so much better than what I saw at several seperate stores.  The picture quality is great, and even the sound quality isn't too bad either as a stand alone.  When I have my 6.1 suround sound BOSE speakers connected with the TV it makes any movie, TV show or game sound incredible.  For this past Super Bowl we had a party, and everyone commented on the TV and the quality of the HD channels.  I currently go through Comcast for my cable company, and us componet cables for almost everything I have.  I also have a Sony DVD player, XBOX, PS2, Gamecube, and XBOX 360 all connected to my TV by my receiver.  Everything that I play or watch looks great, and I have no complaints with the quality.  My only complaint would be the lack of options on the PIP.  I have an old 32\" Sony flatscreen TV and it came with a lot of options for PIP.

{"Title":"Great Investment","Author":"St.Eve","ReviewID":"R1L7AEAZVHCG8T","Overall":"good","Content":"I finally decided to upgrade from my 27\" tube and go with a big HDTV.  I purchased this tv last weekend (03-31-06) from a local Circuit City store.  They had it delivered the very next day, unboxed it, conntected it, and made sure it worked.  The picture quality is incredible.  I also purchased a Samsung progressive scan HD-convert DVD player with this TV.  I don't think I will ever go to the movie theater again.  The sound quality from the built in speakers is decent.  I have the TV hooked up to my HTS so I only use the TV's speakers when I watch regular tv.I hooked up my Xbox to this TV using the component cables and the graphics are incredible.  Be sure to go into your Xbox settings (from the dashboard) and enable 480p, 720p, 1080i, and widescreen.  I didn't do that at first and was very disappointed with the graphics and got nausea from the stretched and blocky image.  Once I enabled those settings it made a HUGE difference.  Also, the menu and setup for the tv is extremely user-friendly.  It is very straight forward and self explanatory.My complaints about this tv are the TV Guide feature, the included (universal) tv remote included, and the \"rainbow effect\".  As far as the TV Guide, it does not work for me at all.  I've keyed in all our local settings and it is not providing us with any listings.  Everything is showing \"not available\".  As far as the tv remote, it's a universal remote which allows you to program and control a DVD player, VCR, and Cable box.  Like I said, I purchased a Samsung DVD player along with this tv and am only able to control \"play\" and \"stop\" from the tv remote.  I am unable to scroll through the DVD menu, needless to say make any selections.  Good thing I purchased a separate universal remote from CC at the time of this purchase.  The \"rainbow effect\" was only something I had read about in regards to DLP's but never actually seen it.  Yesterday, however,  I started noticing it while watching a DVD (24 season 3).  It only occurs in certain scenes, and like I said, I only noticed it for the first time yesterday, so it's only on certain DVD's.Someone had mentioned a loud fan.  If you are watching tv on mute you will hear the fan, but I sure don't.  You will only hear the fan after you turn off your TV.  The fan will stay on for about a minute to cool down the bulb.  Not a problem for me.Overall, the picture quality is incredible.  Watching anything in HD makes up for the negative.  If you plan on using HDMI I'd recommend buying the HDMI cable from Walmart for about $25.  The least expensive HDMI cable Circuit City had was selling for an outrageous $100.  I did purchase a Monster Surge Protector (stage 1) for a little over $100.  I would highly recommend it.  If I could do it again I probably would have invested in a stage 2 or 3 surge protector and paid the extra $200-$300.  I did not opt for their extended warranty.PS.  Our living room looks so much nicer with this TV, it's not only a great piece of electronic, but also a great piece of furniture.","Date":"April 8, 2006"}

The only place I saw that had a slightly lower price for this model was on Ebay, but that was without shipping.  Did I mention shipping from Amazon was FREE.  I was really happy and surprised about that.So far after watching a DVD (Star Wars III) and flipping through the channels I have to say that this TV is great.

I am very glad I did. This TV is great and just like everyone says, 15 minutes after opening it you're watching great TV. It takes some tweaking to get it looking better but even out of the box, it's cool. I used the Star Wars Episode III disc to optimize the DVD settings with the THX optimizer and now DVDs look even better. I still have to get the HDMI cable to make the digital cable look better. Great TV, great price. Downsides are just like everyone else said - the TV guide feature is highly annoying. Samsung would do well to get rid of them. I actually can't figure out how to disable it completely yet but I reduced it somewhat. The PIP might not be the best but my digital cable has PIP so I'll use that one. These are SMALL gripes. This TV is amazing and all my pals with high end TVs were really impressed. The family is happy and so am I. Just be careful with it on the stand as it's not that heavy and one good push can knock it off. I'm going to get some rubber feet for it or something...DO NOT Hesitate to buy this television.

The picture is bright with great color rendition. With HD (we have DISH satellite service) it is simply unbelievable the degree of clarity and detail. Using the latest Star Wars DVD as another example you'll see detail you never saw at the theater. We use an older progressive scan and I can't imagine it being any better!On the initial selection process we chose this over Sony based on side by side comparisons. We had a hard time deciding between this model and the 50\" Samsung. We sit 15' away and we were afraid this TV would overwhelm the room. Bottomline, if you're facing the same situation, get the 56\". Also I designed/built a new stand to accommodate the TV.. it's worked out great. The dimensions of that are 24\"deep x 5' long x 26\" high. It works and views great at that level.For those with shipping concers the delivery was great. They had a high end trucking service that brought the TV in , took it out the box and plugged it in to make sure it was OK.This is a great TV!  The fit and finish are excellant, instructions clear cut and the item well packaged. Samsung is the new leader in my estimation!","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

Milburn \"davart1\"","ReviewID":"R3PM8CN6YYDJFZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV about 6 months and I'm running this with regular ol Direct TV, not the HD and I'm getting a great picture. Setup and controls are easy with tons of hookups and inputs on the back and side. Plenty of screen setting and did I mention the BRIGHT pricture. I'd say you really need to be at the very least 10' away to see the best picture as any closer you will see some pixelling with regular SAT input without the upgrade to HDMI receiver and HD service.I do recommend that you upgrade all of your cables to the best you can afford it goes a long way to improve the picture. I can use the PIP and run my PC screen on one side and watch TV on the other. Which is handy if you are a ADHD multi-tasker like myself. But admittedly running the PC on a S-Video cable doesn't give you the same quality screen you'll get on the PC. I'm using a laptop so I have no other outputs on it. Might try the PC-IN the TV has to offer on a desktop system and see if it's any better one day but right now it's not an issue. However it is nice to play a game in 56\" and game from regular gaming stations like PS2 or Gamecube look GREAT. Some have noted problems with gaming but most of game we use a slower games and I have not noticed a problem or I'm sure I would have heard about it from the short people. As I noted componant and optical cables do a lot and really do there most with DVD's. I can't say much about the sound I don't use it as I use a surround sound system as I think most people would. It a great TV have a great picture that you can see from the sides as well as the front with no loose of picture like you get on some projection TV.

I have owned many TVs in the past, sticking mostly to the Hitachi brand name because of the success I have had with it over the years.  This was the first time I had purchased a TV over the Internet.  Prior to purchasing, I went to a local store and previewed the TV.  I then purchased the TV on Amazon for $1,999, which was significantly less than anywhere else.  This is a TV that is feature-rich, well built, with good sound and a great picture.  The TV's PC input is exceptional, blowing up the computer screen to 56 inches and making the online experience almost presentation like.My only frustration is that 95% of cable channels are either standard definition or digital, neither of which support the TV's 16:9 viewing angle.  The TV (or some cable boxes) will stretch the picture to fit the \"wide screen\" format, but it clearly disorts the picture and stretches everything.  Hopefully, a great deal more HD channels will be added in the near future.  As far as the TV goes, I would recommend it to anyone.

Yes its annoying that it takes 30 seconds for the bulb to warm up, but once its on, the  DLP 720p looks great. My one and only complaint is trying to use the Samsung built in speakers for my center channel ( TV Voice ). Hooking the TV in with my AC3 5.1 surround sound amplifier was a complete bust.  The Samsung does a lot of video processing ( de-interlacing interlaced video, etc ) which takes time. Samsung apparently delays the audio feed to match  the video latency. If I use the Samsung for my center audio channel, the delay between the TV speakers and my L+R surround speakers is terrible ( think echo-echo-echo ). Wish Samsung had provided the means of disabling this audio delay, apparently - they don't.

Regular broadcast is limited to reception but mine is great so the picture is great.C) Average - Remote control is ok, I don't like the tv guide option as I have satelite and they don't work together.D) PIP - Does not support PIP for Digital broadcast.E) Slight lag in timing for certain Video games but nothing major (The kicking meter in Madden is slightly off).F) No problems with the DNieG) Amazone was the best price and delivery was quick - No problems - Give them your cell so they can call you otherwise they leave a message on one number.H) Delivery guys moved my existing 36 Sony to another room and placed the TV on stand.

I researched these for quite a while before buying and all of the reviews were good.If I were buying today my first choice would be flat panel LCD if money was no object, but since it is with me, I would go with a plasma because I believe it is the best bang for the buck at current market prices (June, 2007).  42 inches seems to be the break point.  At 42 and below LCD and plasma seem to be about the same price but plasma wins the value contest at 50 inches and above.Tip:  If you are visiting a store to look at TV's and you wear glasses (sometimes, like I do), make sure and take them.","Date":"June 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"LOUD fan noise?","Author":"A. P. Pendleton \"TV Eye\"","ReviewID":"R2GPSLGWI3MHWY","Overall":"bad","Content":"Updated Review.HD looks awesome on the set. I did not know that the standard \"broadcast\" channels (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox) on HD can come through via an antenna  - without cable or sat - with perfect reception; the channel is either perfect or it doesn't come in at all. Very cool. In my case,  all I did was hook up an extra coaxial cable to the antenna-out and all those HD channels come in perfectly.  Also, for you novices, the HD channels come in via other channel numbers (so a your CBS channel 2 may be channel 60 in HD - look on the web for listings).Anyway, as I said in the first version of this review, the thing about the TV that STILL drives me crazy that no one else has complained about is the noise the fan makes in the TV. I gotta tell you, that constant  \"humming\" drives me nuts - I can hear it very clearly whenever the sound gets low. And it's coming from the fan vent cover in the back. Maybe I have a defect or something, or maybe I just have very sensitive ears, but my 5-year old 42\" Sony projection TV makes not a hint of noise. Doesn't this bug anybody else?BTW, I switched from Dish to Comcast because Dish requires a $300 up-front payment to get an HD tuner with a DVR (plus a monthly fee). Comcast doesn't charge the upfront cost. I can't tell a great deal of difference between the cable and satellite, although some channels look better than others. Also, being in Los Angeles, my old Dish Network gave me East coast time feeds on most basic cable channels whereas Comcast is on a West coast feed, so now my favorite shows start three hours later!As for the TV, I think I'm going to send it back and get a Sony.","Date":"March 14, 2006"}

When I called Samsung to report the problem (I had owned the tv for less then 60 days at the time), they explained to me they would call me back within 5 days to let me know if a service provider would be able to repair the set. Customer Service at Samsung was miserable, no one was empathetic to my problem of the tv failing within 60 days of purchase and and no one thought there was anything unusual about me waiting a few weeks to have it repaired.While I am sure the TV is great if it works perfectly, I found that should you purchase a samsung product and it not work, Samsung is not interested in having it repaired for you in any kind of timely manner, under warranty or not.

It's sitting upstairs and the repairman says it will cost between $800-$1200 to fix it.The light didn't burn out.  The Light Engine did.  Replacing the entire \"insides\" of this television is the only way to fix it.  Tried the lamp, the ballast and even replaced the Color Wheel.  Nope.

{"Title":"Never buying Samsung again!","Author":"Karen","ReviewID":"R2TE9YNMEY1Y2L","Overall":"bad","Content":"There's something to be said when all the earlier reviews of the TV are great, but all the later reviews are bad. I thought TVs were built to last longer than 6 years, but alas, almost 6 years exactly, and my TV is on the brink of dying.  I'm thoroughly upset that I have to shell out more money to buy another TV so quickly.  About half a year ago, my TV starting blacking out randomly - the audio would continue, but the video would completely black out. It was not my lamp needing replacement, because if you turned off the lights in the room, you could see the lamp was still lit. I had to turn off my TV, wait for the lamp to turn off, then turn the TV back on, and it would be okay (if i tried to turn it back on before the lamp turned off, it wouldn't work).  In the beginning this was happening maybe once every few days.  Over the last few months, the frequency has become to the point where it's almost unwatchable. Last night, in the span of 3 hours, it must have blacked out at least 20 times, sometimes 3-4 times in a row (where I would turn off the TV, wait for lamp to turn off, turn back on the TV, video would come back on but black out a few seconds later).  Thank goodness for DVR, but this is not really the way I want to watch football games, or any shows for that matter!  I tried researching my problem, and it seems like it's a very common problem with Samsung TVs, though no one had a solution. It looks like most think it's a bad digital board, which I am not willing to pay to replace/fix - it'd be cheaper to just buy a new TV at this point.  Back in 2005 when I originally bought the TV, Samsung was relatively new to the field, but the ratings were great, so I took a chance and went for it. Too bad we didn't have the foresight to know that these TVs aren't built to last!  Never buying Samsung again.","Date":"September 12, 2011"}

That's about 60% of the cost of the TV - and I will have to pay another $160 for each set to replace the projector bulbs.  I knew about  having to replace the bulbs but the bulb cost still increases the viewing cost per hour a lot.  The 50\" tv is only two years old and is seldom used so the cost per viewing hour is already way too high.I have owned GE and RCA TVs in the past and never had the problems I am having with the Samsung TVs.

(Warrenty was only 1 year.) This was my first HD, largest and most expensive TV I'd ever purchased.  Initially I was thrilled with the picture, the sound was fine.  Until the component input suddenly started showing green bars across the screen. All other inputs did the same except for the HDMI.  Instead, when the TV is turned on with HDMI, it plays normally for anywhere from 5 to 25 seconds.  Then the picture freezes for a few seconds, goes black for a few more and then plays again, only to repeat the process.  The manual says to unplug the TV for 30 seconds if it is behaving erratically.  This fixed the problem for HDMI if we did it everytime we turned on the TV.  Recently, even that isn't working.  I've seen other complaints of similar behavior online.  Usually the issue is identified as a bad video board that runs ~$800.  Every other TV I've ever purchased has lasted at least 15 years.  Granted, those were CRT, but only three and a half years for a $2000+ TV is robbery. I'm shopping for another TV but it won't be a Samsung.","Date":"February 15, 2010"}

I replaced the dlp lamp yesterday ($144 plus my time) and it worked all evening.  This morning, dead again.

Mine is a common complaint and there are no really good fixes.  There is lots of parts replacement advice, though, and any number of other fixes to try and time to waste.I have to decide whether to keep pouring money into this pit or call it a day and give up.  I hate to spend $600/year on TVs plus repairs but I think that's what I'll end up doing.  I'll just have to accept that I bought a TV with many inherent and documents defects, buy another one and go on with my life.

I was convinced it was the best TV for the money, and that I would be totally happy --- WRONG!Out of the box the TV is impressive despite the white glowing thing in the middle of the screen (only seen when tv is off).  It has something to do with the reflections within... not a big deal.Analog picture sucks, HD is amazing, DVDS  are below average.  Viewing angle is TERRIBLE.Viewing angle is important to me.... ever since I saw those big old projection tv's back in the 90s that basically looked like crap unless you sat dead center infront of it.  We are way to advanced with technology to have limited viewing angles now.That being said........can you see the tv when setting offset--- yes, but it is darker...and not impressive.The noise from the colorwheel/fan REALLY annoyed me.  It was loud sometimes, quiet others, but Samsung assured me this was normal.If you turn this tv off, and then right back on again, it makes a horrific cracking noise that makes me feel like the tv is going to die right there.  I don't know if this is normal.pip is pointless if you have a cable box too... one of the main reasons I got it.  I couldnt get pip with the cable box.But the real problem with this tv, the factor that eventually made me return the TV and get the fantastic Panasonic 50\" plasma (top rated consumer reports plasma which I LOVE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND!), was that the samsung DLP had SMUDGES/FINGERPRINTS inside the freaking screen!!! I spent 10 minutes trying to clean my screen before i realized they were INSIDE the screen...... give me a break.  I pay $2000+ for a TV that someone compromised with their lucky handprint?  Forget it.... projection tv's just feel weak to me...they seem to have too many moving parts....If you want the best...... Get a Plasma... Burnin??? DONT WORRY, the advancements they have made make burnin VERY unlikely unless you leave QFC on all night, or watch 4:3 programming all day without \"stretching it out.\"Please understand I'm writing this review because I DID own the TV, not because I dislike DLP vs. Plasmas.... some people on here review a product poorly jsut because they think theirs is better, and that is NOT what i'm doing.

It was great and had an amazing picture and sound quality.  Then the many mechanical parts started failing.  I replaced the bulb once.  No big deal, but it still cost $120 to replace the bulb.  Since the end of 2010 the DLP only would work on the HDMI setting.  My analog channels and other inputs (much like other people said) have green lines going through the screen.  Good bye playing Nintendo Wii after this happened.  Then, about 6 months ago, my HDMI input stopped working and the lamp light would stay on with no picture and then shut off by itself.  I did a lot of research into the causes of the problems.  Basically it seems like the analog and digital boards need to be replaced.  Those cost $500 at least to get both of them new or re-worked.  I obviously wasn't going to do that when I can go buy a LCD (never again buying a Samsung DLP) for that much practically.  I read a lot of forum's and people said to take out the PCB and apply pressure on the DNIE chip on the digital board.  I've been doing that for the past 4 months and it helps for a few days and then fails again.  I then decided to rig something to apply permanent pressure to the chip in the casing because someone suggested that.  That didn't help.  I then thought perhaps I just needed a re-flow of the solder on the digital board to at least get my HDMI working again.  Using a microscope and soldering iron I re-flowed the board.  I did this 4 days ago and expected the worst when I plugged it in.  However, my TV came back to life and it worked solid for 4 days until this morning.  It's back to the same problem of shutting off by itself and now I can't get the picture back.  I've tried everything I can without pumping money into having the problem looked at.  Now the question is, do I store this somewhere in case there's a lawsuit against Samsung?  I really thought this TV since it was so expensive six years ago would last me 15 years minimum with the only addition being adding a new lamp when it burned out.  There are way too many mechanical parts that can fail.  I know people with the same TV who have had to replace color wheel's, etc...  LCD here I come.","Date":"May 30, 2012"}

I also currently own a Panasonic '42 plasma.  The first Samsung ordered and received was defective out of the box and since I ordered it through Amazon they were un-willing to replace it or provide a refund do to their policy (make sure you read the return policy).  The second one I ordered was from another supplier who gave a 30 day unconditional replacement if the unit proved to be defective.  For anything over 27 inches I recommend you purchase the product from a supplier with this type of 30 day replacement. While the Samsung is stylish the picture issues with \"ghosting\" and pixel distortion is far more prevalent than the Panasonic.  At times the picture is fine at others it is clearly distorted.  The exception is when viewing HD.  In this case the picture is great.  I have had the cable company out to check signal quality, called the manufacturer, talked with the vendor and get various answers as to why since this poor quality is also with DVD players and any type of cabling connection I use.  The bottom line is that side by side the picture quality is far superior on the Panasonic and I don't have the same pixel or ghosting issues as with the Samsung.  The Samsung is more stylish but its features end there.  Price wise, Panasonic and Samsung are very comparable.  The one feature they both don't have is an easy to use sleep bottom on the remote.

Today we turned the tv on and there were purple and green lines running across the screen.  After doing some research online, we saw that we were not the only ones to have this problem.  Immediately, we called Samsung and they were more than happy to send a technician out to assess the situation to let us know how much money it would cost us to fix the television, if that were at all possible.  They were unable to provide any information about what the problem might be. (Funny that online I was able to learn that this is a common problem with this model.)  After complaining to two separate Samsung customer service agents, the best they could do was tell us that we would have someone return our call in 24-48 hours.  Having seen the others posts on Amazon, I have little hope that they will rectify this.  Never again, Samsung.....Melissa and Dave MedeirosCT, USA","Date":"July 15, 2009"}

No problems, knock on wood, yet.  We watch about 10 hours of TV a week and the occasional movie.  I run the Burn In Protection once a month to make sure there is no burn in.UPDATE:  Unfortunately I need to report that just after 4 years of minimum use, I now have a 2 inch black stripe running vertically off center on the screen.  Calling service today, but from my preliminary research on cost of parts, it does not look good.  If this is a cheap fix, then I won't be as aggravated.

Unbelievable!!! My mistake was  not to get insurance and now I am paying the price!!! So don't be fooled and do not go buying Panasonic. I seriously regret not going for Sony!! Now I don't know what to do because it's going to cost me a pretty penny. Does anyone have any suggestions or maybe some advise in a situation like this. I'm not going to spend a ton of money to get this t.v fixed. It is not worth it...I might end up having some other kind of problem later down the line.

Almost exactly one year later (suspiciously close to the warranty termination date) we started noticing lines/bands on the left side of the screen while viewing shows (all channels). This was in September of 06. It is now October and now when we turn the set on the TV only shows lines that look like lines on a map for 10 minutes and then the picture appears.We took it to a Panasonic servicenter (Elwin Electronics in Warwick, RI) and were told $1700 to fix - but they could NOT tell us what the problem was... \"doesn't matter, whatever it is, you need a new panel - it is all one unit\". No no no - this is unacceptable. So I called Panasonic...WOW - what a convoluted runaround! Spent HOURS calling them... one department sent me another who sent me to another. NO ONE was willing to take accountability and I was thrown into an endless loop.The takeaway? STAY AWAY from this TV... and THINK HARD about doing business with Panasonic. Their \"customer service\" is all but non-existant. You can, however, spend many HOURS listening to nice voice prompts... that lead NOWHERE.","Date":"October 16, 2006"}

There are so many name brands out there that cost alot less than the Protron. Shop NBC did not even back this up and quit carrying them shortly after I bought mine. I believed Shop NBC hype about it having an \"A\" quality panel and that Protron was built like \"a name brand\"  that they couldn't mention (SONY) but that the public was just paying for the name and the warehousing of their tvs. Not that mine was cheap, it cost approx. $800.00 at the time, HA HA HA.I'll never do that again.

This set seemed to be the ideal price/size + features.  And the amount of positive reviews of this set really pushed me in this direction.PLEASE NOTE:  I have not had this set professionally calibrated, which may improve the picture slightly.For the money this set is a good value.  If you want superb picture and price is not as much of an issue I'd keep looking.Update:  By default the \"Vivid\" video setting is turned on.  While shapening the picture it also introduced a number of artifacts, at least on my standard def input.If I could revise my star rating I'd probably bump it to 3, possibly 4 stars.  2 is definitely too low.","Date":"April 1, 2006"}

{"Title":"Huge Flaws, Horrible Picture, Changing!!","Author":"Dustin Perritt","ReviewID":"R1RSG14CX7RMEV","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am always reading reviews on Amazon, and finding that there are a lot of reviews that have numerous people voting them helpful that simply prove to be way off. Now I am always a little more critical when reading reviews on Amazon as a result since the person rating the item may have never had a similar product to compare it too, etc. As a result I thought it would help for people to know a little background about my experience with televisions as to know that this is not my first lcd or similar style tv: I currently own 2 Plasma Television sets (a 42\" Panasonic Viera Plasma (TERRIFIC TV) and a 42\" Zenith Plasma) and 3 lcd Television sets, as well as, 2 LCD monitors. I have set up all the televisions on my own, and have a very detailed background in this as a result.I set up the Sony 26\" Bravia Wega LCD TV for the first time 3 days ago. One of the first things I noticed upon watching my first broadcast via normal DirectTv was that the images appeared very grainy and pixelated. I proceeded to adjust the set using a dvd disc specifically for this. After the settings were completed, the color was great, however, there were even more noticeable pixelation of the images, and several very clear horizontal lines would appear spuratically through the TV broadcast and / or DVD movies about once every 5 seconds when viewed up to 4-5 FEET AWAY. I further went to notice that the images would stretch and then compress in 3 thick vertical bars in 3 equally spaced areas of the TV!! This was noticeable to me and others at any distance, but only occured approximately once or twice every 45 minutes or so.Overall I felt this TV portrayed an image of lesser quality than my cheapiest LCD, my 20\" Syntax Olevia. Perhaps Sony forgot this was a $1500 TV that was suppose to be HD. Yes, HD works, but if you try to have it on a desk or anywhere where you would view it within 4-5 feet, both in HD or Standard, this TV picture quality is abhorant. I have never had a TV that was suppose to be an HD TV have so many HUGE FLAWS when viewed within 4-5 feet. Of course most TVs there is always some line noise, pixelation, etc., but at the level portrayed by this unit, Sony SHOULD RECALL THIS UNIT. The new model replacing this Sony 26\" is nearly perfect, but I feel as though Sony ripped its loyal customers off by charging such an outrageous price for Television that is well below the normal Sony quailty that I have grown to know and love. Honestly, shame on you Sony, Shame on you.","Date":"November 13, 2005"}

It is inconceivable that Sony would put out a bad product like this...there should be a recall of it. The facts: The picture is not good for live/recorded shots of people...there is little definition or depth of facial characteristics. Every person appears like they have pancake make-up--like the image has been air-brushed of all definition. For me, these situations make up 50% of what I look at. I was so trusting of Sony, that I assumed I was at fault and either had the wrong cables, cable connections or couldn't tune it properly. All the best cables and fine tuning the color/image/light balance is of no avail. I was taken by the Sony name and by Crutchfield's claim...and I quote from their catalog \"...Bravia is...a guarantee from Sony that you'll enjoy years of supurb picture quality....\" Enough said","Date":"May 12, 2006"}

In two years, the picture became so dark that it was difficult to view.  I called tech support, but nothing would fix it.  I called customer relations and got nowhere.  The authorized service dealer was in another city, close to an hour away.  I decided it wasn't worth the hassle of driving that far, leaving the set for an estimate, and driving back to pick it up, so I gave the set away.  No use throwing good money after bad. I wrote a letter to SONY describing my frustration and displeasure.  I received a phone call about my letter from SONY national customer relations.  The rep wanted to know with whom I spoke.  I told him I would look for my notes.  I spent 20 minutes looking, called him back with the names, and discovered he knew all along who they were--they were in my record (his file) the whole time.  He even told me the date and corrected one of the names.  If I was upset before all this, I was really upset after this charade.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, left a message, but never heard back.  I called Public Relations, left a message, but never heard back.  That was about a week ago.

My wife's cheapo old-school Sanyo is way more pleasing to watch.  The imperfections in the picture are so blatant that you have to sit 10 feet back to not be constantly annoyed by them.

I feel compelled to do so for this product, in an attempt to warn people of the poor quality.I agree totally with Dustin's review, as I experienced the same result.While the external product is beautiful to look at, the picture quality is horrible.  In the two days I've had it, I've spent a large amount of time with different configurations and cables in an attempt to make it work.  None did.  This TV is a lemon, plain and simple.I have DirecTV and have tried regular cable, composite, S-Video and component cables.  All produce a grainy, flat picture.  The only picture that came close to acceptable was the component video cable through my Toshiba Tivo DVR.  But even so, it isn't acceptable to me and isn't worth settling for.Another thing that I found disappointing was that you are buying a 26\" TV, but you don't get 26\" worth of viewing area!  The best (and it isn't great) picture comes from a \"normal\" mode that cuts a good two inches off of each side.  \"Wide\" view is too distorted to watch comfortably.  I'm used to a TV displaying the picture on the whole screen.  I'll admit to not being totally up on the aspect ratios, but it still seemed to be a rip off to me.Although you save a lot of money through Amazon for this TV, I think it should be discontinued.  It's in the box, waiting for UPS to take it away.My suggestion would be to do what I'm going to do:  Hook the 10 plus year-old 19\" Magnavox back up and go back to hunting for something worthy of your hard-earned money.","Date":"January 14, 2006"}

Shortly after I got it (July of 2006) I had problems.  When I turned the set on the green light would come on but almost at once the green light would go out and the red light would come on in it's place.  No picture, no sound, nothing.  I called customer service and went through a couple of tests and was told to send it back by FedEx - which Phillips didn't pay for.  I would think that if the set was under warranty they should pay shipping but they didn't.  I got a different set back (different serial #)in a month to 6 weeks and it seemed to work fine but a couple of weeks later I noticed that when I would turn the set on the picture would come on but no sound!  However I discovered that if I turned the set off and back on I had sound.  I called Phillips and reported this  but they didn't know what was causing this.  Since it did work I didn't want to pay the freight to send it back again and get another one that might do the exact same thing so I got a case number and made a record of the problem.  Then in December of 2008 I had exactly the same problem I had the first time (green light then red light no pic no sound)  I called Phillips again and was told that I would have to take it in for repair but the set was out of warranty.  When I gave them the two case numbers from before they had no record of those cases. The woman said that they probably cleaned out the database and deleted old cases after some period of time.I called the phone # of the service center she gave me and was told that it would cost me $89 non refundable to have the problem diagnosed.  She also told me that there were very few parts listed for this set and even if they couldn't get the parts to fix it I would still have to pay $89.My advise is not to buy this set.","Date":"December 30, 2008"}

Bulb life of 100-800 HOURS(2-5 months) is expected, even the replacements from Toshiba.  Mine lasted 53 days!  Replacement parts are NOT currently available and even if they were you would need another one very soon.  I wouldn't buy a Toshiba Rear projection until 2007.If you have one now you WILL have this problem.  Do what I did.  Return you TV and exchange for another brand.  Even if you are outside your stores return policy, Toshiba has return contracts with all the major retailers, get an R/A number form Toshiba (1-800-631-3811) they can authorize a return to the retail store and get you watching a new HDTV before Football season begins.

I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common, Toshiba will not replace the screen.  I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude.  So, look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing.

Replacement was nearly instant, installation was easy, but I guess the TV has to go back, since the warranty won't last forever.  I'll check to see if they'd like to swap for a reworked version since I love the TV.As additional input, I could not get a stand for over 6 months, probably because they'd stopped production due to the flaw.","Date":"September 13, 2006"}

I bought the TV middle of Dec and stopped working after 2 weeks. Stays on for 5 minutes.Philips could not locate a support center, then cannot find the part and customer service is pathetic, no supervisor, do not do anything. Then they sent the wrong part, then they refused to do anything about it. The TV is not a phone to return to the store easily. Customer support is indifferent and threatens to make your life difficult if you complain. THere is no way to complain against some of the rude representatives.It is still not fixed. That is $2000+ of not working stuff.","Date":"January 25, 2006"}
{"Title":"I am disappointed","Author":"V. C. McGowan \"Iceman\"","ReviewID":"R1RF863V35HDVA","Overall":"bad","Content":"I'm on Amazon searching for a new plasma tv and happened across the customer reviews for this set. I wish I had read them before purchasing the boat anchor that is hanging above my fireplace. All of the positive remarks mentioned in the other reviews are true...excellent picture, excellent features for the price. However, DO NOT purchase this set without buying the extended warrantee, and even then beware. Philips service is awful! They contract out warrantee service to \"Joe's TV Repair\" and you get a repair person that cannot even turn it on, if he shows up. I'm on my second set, the first was delivered and worked perfectly... for three hours and then the sound went out totally. I bought it at Sears and they sent out a \"tech\" that basically took off the back cover and looked around, put the cover back on and called the office to exchange the set. The replacement set worked fine, with the exception of a rattle occasionally fom the speakers, for six months. Now it's belly up and a tech is supposed to come out tomorrow to repair it, but I'm not at all confident. Reading the other reviews about parts availability convinced me to just cut my losses and buy a higher quality device. If he can fix it tomorrow, great, I can put this set in my sons room. Think twice about purchasing this product, unless you have unlimited patience and unlimted money it will probably be a mistake.","Date":"June 29, 2006"}

I called the truck company every day to follow up and finally it was delivered back to their warehouse after 10 days. When i called again this time it was the same rude lady again and she said they now have the product back but it takes 10 to 14 days to process and credit the money back, she did not even wait for my answer and hung up.

Never again will I do that either.  First the TV came in with a bar coming down the one screen.  This was all fixed under warranty but getting a repair guy to come by and take it and then having philips ship them the parts took a total of 60+ days to get it back (most of the delays was related to philips getting them the correct parts).  PHILIPS customer support is TERRIBLE when you try to call and get an update or complain (its like they hear it all the time)!!! Please note that this means that the TV is 2/3rd past its 90 day warranty and I didnt even have any usage of the tv since the first day of purchase!  I asked for an extension but they would not even remotely assist.  Once that headache was over, and it came back, the tv worked great for about 2 months and now it has that \"black screen of death\" that everyone complains about (and of course its past the warranty period).

How wrong I was.  After 15 minutes of operation there was a loud electrical pop and white smoke came billowing out of the TV (later diagonosed as a blown power supply board).  After three frustating weeks of Philips buracracy, lack of returned phone calls/emails to the repair shop, and a repair process that maximized the amount of time and run-around involved, Amazon came to the rescue and replaced the defective unit.

It has the most horrible sound of any TV set I have ever heard and the picture goes out for no reason. It makes distorted rattling sounds frequently which is very annoying and my picture (just like many victims of this televison)goes black and has to be turned off for a bit and turned back on to get it to work(sometimes that doesn't work). Contacting service from Philips is a joke they will have nothing to do with you, especially when it comes to complaining about this TV. THEY EVEN ADMIT THAT THE TV IS FAULTY AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED. I also made the mistake of buying a Philips Audio Jukebox MP3 and it also turned out to be a lemon. Philips is gone to HELL and their products are horrible. I used to be a big fan of Philips but I SWEAR NOT TO BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THEM. Don't make the same mistakes I made...BUY PANASONIC.

Often it is difficult to understand soft dialogue from the TV speakers.  Where I would warn others is Philips customer service; if anything goes wrong with the TV, I wouldn't count on getting any response from Philips.  I had an issue with the CableCARD reader, and all I got was misinformation and delay tactics from customer service. I upgraded the software, and got the cable company to come out 3 times for various tests all demanded by Philips, after which they assured me they would fix or replace the set.  After 4 months, they finally admitted they weren't going to fix the problem.  \"You bought the TV, so it's your problem not ours\" was basically their answer.  Short of taking them to court, and it isn't worth that hassle, I really have no way of getting them to honor their warranty.  I'm sure Philips is well aware of that fact.","Date":"October 24, 2006"}

It had a good picture for just over a year. It always had little issues, and I assumed they were heat related - although the unit was not against a wall. I had a fan running on the back of the unit when it was on to assure it had plenty of air. It would go black from time to time so I would let it site and wait for the picture to come back. then from time to time it would get lines in the screen for a few minutes then go away. About three months ago, the unit popped a little and had lines at the bottom of the screen. About 2 minutes later it had lines across the entire screen. It has a picture that is very 80's reminding me of rabbit ears. I can still make out most of the picture but very difficult to tell what's going on.I felt devastated, I paid way too much for this TV to only get 15 or 16 months of service from it.  I have three Philips TVs at home and this is definitely the last. I searched their site but based on the feedback I see on other sites, I see that it is nearly impossible to get this repaired - parts take 6 mths or more to get. I still have it here non-functional.

It died in June, 2007, nothing but a blinking red light.  The meaning of that blinking red light is not explained anywhere in the manual or on the website. I searched the Philips web site for the words \"service\" or \"repair\" and came up with nothing.I Called the 800 number and was told that the only authorized repair shop is more than 60 miles from my home. They offer no set price for service or estimates for reapair.  The same television today sells for $1099.  The quality of the picture makes it not worth repairing. I decided to drop it off at the local land-fill and buy something new.  Beware, with Philips you are on your own if it fails. Based on other reviews I am happy that it lasted 18 months. It was a good buy at the time and an inexpensive first HD television. I will not buy another Philips television.I purchased a 47in 1080P LCD GV47LF VIZIO television at BJ's this week for $1599.

We purchased our television on 21 Dec 05.  Less than two months later, on 15 Feb 06, the television stopped working altogether.  The only thing that would happen is the little red light on the front would blink 7 times.  Since the box for the tv said to call Philips for any problems, that's what we did.  Philips gave us a list of repair shops in the area.  We immediatelly called one of the shops who said they would have to come get the tv.  Two days later they show up for the television.  It is now well into March and we still do not have a television.  After juggling many excuses, the repair shop has told us that every single thing inside the tv case has to be replaced.  Mind you, it's not as if they have ever called us to give us updates...we have to call them and beg for updates.  I finally blew my top today after getting a similar runaround.  I was told today that it's on backorder and they have no idea when the shipment of parts will arrive.  After then calling Philips, they tell us to go ahead and call Sears, where we purchased it, and see if there is anything they can do.  Sears initial answer was, \"the purchase has been longer than 30 days...we can't help you\".  We then called an office of Sears that is larger in the food chain.  We initially thought they would be able to help.  He said that we just need to take it back to sears and have them repair it because it's under warranty.  He said that once they determine the seriousness of the issues, then they will just replace it.****hold for the fine print****  The man then tells us that since the current repair company opened the television to diagnose the problem, there is nothing Sears can do!!!

Stell","ReviewID":"R2A41S7Y8XL2PF","Overall":"bad","Content":"We purchased this TV the day after thanksgiving 2005 and it was a Christmas present so it was not even taken out of the box until 12/25/05.  We put this in our bedroom so it has not been used much - maybe 12 hours in the past year.  The other day when we turnedit on the picture was there for about 2 seconds then slid down the screen untill it was gone and all you could see was vertical lines - if yo uchange the channell the picture would come back for 2 seconds and do the same thing.  I spent a lot of time holding for CS with polaroid and received nothing!  Unfortunately we were just outside of the 1 year warranty but I thought maybe they woul dmake an exception since it was so close and pretty obvious that it was a xmas present because of the time of year but NO Luck!  We are now going to take it to a local repair store and pay $45 to see if it can be fixed reasonbly.  I am very dissappointed.  I do think the at the TV was alright for what we used it for when it did work.","Date":"December 27, 2006"}

{"Title":"TV delivered non-working, worst support I have EVER experienced, but a great TV","Author":"Gabriel","ReviewID":"R326MARU8IG07X","Overall":"bad","Content":"Since my original review, I have revised my opinion of this set.  I now give it four stars out of five, but it's the support that gets only two stars out of five.I'm a pretty fair guy, and I always try to post something positive about things when I can.  I never appreciate when others have nothing good to say about something, and can only harp about how bad something is.Out of the box, the TV's screen flickered on and off, with a buzzing sound that was annoying.The specs sounded good, the reviews said \"good value, great TV\", but I didn't realize I would be spinning the roulette wheel on this.  But in spite of spending the extra cash for the extended warranty, it took forever to get a replacement.  It is advertised as \"in-home repair\", but what that means is you have to first find a way to actually reach their support teams, which is pretty much impossible, unless they FEEL like calling you back.They offer a telephone number to call, but when you do, you have to navigate through their seemingly easy voicemail system, only to be number whatever in line, and do you wish to hold ... if so press \"1\" ... no answer ... still wish to hold press \"1\" ... no answer ... sorry nobody is answering, so you'll have to go back to the main menu, lose your place in line (seriously ... I'm not kidding here), and start all over.  It's THE WORST SUPPORT LINE EVER!  I spent an hour trying to get through sometimes getting to be next in line, holding, holding, holding, only to get kicked out to the main menu DESPITE ASKING TO HOLD, where I had to start all over, only to find myself SEVENTH IN LINE.I can't say enough about how bad the support communication is.  They suggested sending email, which I sent REPEATEDLY, but without getting anything more than \"we have your information and we'll get back to you\".  It took over a week to get a response.  They took my credit card info, but after that I didn't hear anything from them, despite multiple voicemails left and emails sent.If you want something that you KNOW will work, but want top-notch support, I suggest you consider Sony.  They aren't cheap, but they KNOW how to support their customers.That said, I FINALLY got a response to a sharply worded email to Syntax, letting me know that the TV had already been shipped.  This email came though not from my Customer Support rep, who was in charge of my case, but rather from a different TECHNICAL support rep who I had previous contact with.  They were very responsive after that, and apparently Syntax recognizes it has a problem and is looking for solutions, as they met that day about my issue and have promised to make changes to improve their communications with the consumers.I'm sure I'm not the only person to complain to them, so hopefully things will improve.  I will give them another star for \"intent to improve\" as well as the efforts of one particular technical support rep (initials C.T.) who went out of his way to do what he could to make me happy.As for my replacement TV, it arrived within a couple of days via UPS and it works flawlessly after they responded to my sharp email with the shipping info.So, now for my review of the TV itself, which worked fine this time.I mounted it on the wall.  I STRONGLY recommend doing this, as I have seen a LOT of LCD televisions for sale on eBay with broken screens, which are more expensive to fix than they are to buy new.  This particular TV weights 75 lbs., so you will need a good strong mount.  I chose the Ulti-Mount, which allows the TV to tilt, swivel, and rotate, giving it you a lot of positioning options.As has been mentioned before, the remote doesn't have a very high quality feel, but I like the larger buttons, as I have larger fingers and the remotes with little tiny buttons can be difficult for me to use.The picture on the TV is great.  Excellent color, excellent contrast, good black level, nice sharp image.The menu system is relatively intuitive, although it took me a little while to get used to having to go back to the menu button to leave screens/menus that were opened with other buttons.  One of the neat features of the set is the Electronic Program Guide (EPG).  For the DTV (broadcast HD) channels, it can display the program listing for the currently selected channel, as well as descriptions of the program, as long as the broadcasting station supports those features.The menu button that allows you to select the source brings up a list of inputs to choose from.  It would be nice if the system would allow you to name these sources yourself, so that rather than choosing the \"YpBpr1\" source, I could choose a source named \"Satellite\" instead.  Also, the \"display\" button, which I always mistake for the source button, shows program information, and I think should be relabeled \"Info\".One of the aesthetically cool things about the set, is the brand name \"Olevia\" at the bottom, which lights up in blue.  Unfortunately, it lights up when the TV is OFF, instead of when it's ON, which can be annoying when the set is in a bedroom where you might prefer darkness without annoying lights in the dark.  It also is more intuitive to know when the set is turn on, to see a light on, and when the set is off, the light is off.My only other criticism is that it would be nice if all the menus and displays had the same \"look and feel\".  Instead, there are four different styles and sizes of menus and screens.  Making this consistent would be more aesthetically pleasing.Another \"nice to have\" would be to have the ability for the TV to either automatically switch to the broadcast resolution for the channel being watched, or be able for it to remember the last resolution selected for each channel.  I find switching from a 1080i broadcast to those with lesser resolutions to be annoying, and am constantly having to readjust the resolution to get the best possible display.So, to sum up this review, Syntax's 37\" TV gets four out of five stars, and their support gets two out of five stars (despite the number of stars shown at the top, which apparently I can't change).Good luck!","Date":"March 7, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great picture but HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE","Author":"John","ReviewID":"RQ3YW10WCC5BJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"Similar to other reviews of syntax TV's I agree that they have a nice picture, good features, good value but HORRIBLE customer service.  I purchased mine after Thanksgiving on Black Friday at Microcenter with a great (ca $1000) after rebate price.  Worked well until Jan 11 when it suddenly went stone cold dead.  After wading through the endless customer service phone trees and non-responsive e-mails, I finally was able to talk with someone who said based on the symptoms, a new TV rather than onsite service was in order.  But first I either had to give them my credit card number and they would put a $2000 hold on it or I had to ship the TV back to them and when they got it they would send a replacement.  I chose the latter.  UPS picked it up (reluctantly, at first they claimed it was too big) and two weeks later Syntax shipped another.  UPS lost it.  After dealing with both UPS and Syntax neither of which were very responsive, Syntax shipped another replacement which arrived dead on arrival last week--9 weeks after the first one failed.  Now I am still waiting endlessly to get to talk to someone at Syntax to send me another one.  If you ever get to talk to a live body at Syntax, don't let them go or you could be on hold for another hour when you have to call back. I have yet to have anyone respond to voice messages and only once or twice to e-mails after several days. It will be 10 weeks tomorrow that my first TV went dead and I still don't have one that works and it looks like it could be another month before I have one.., Horrible customer service.  and by the way, it's almost 4 months since I sent in the rebate form to Syntax and I still haven't received it, although their web site now says it has been approved and the check is \"pending.\"  Up until about 2 weeks ago the web site didn't even acknowledge that I had a rebate pending.  Bottom line is that the TV seems to be a good value but if you ever need service you are taking a real gamble.","Date":"March 21, 2006"}

So i was really looking forward to getting home and having this ready for me to set up and enjoy. Then a few hours later when i am talking to my wife online, she gets a call from the tv store. They dont have any of these tv's, so they want to substitute it with an LG372CD. Not even in the same ball park. If I wanted a cheap crappy lcd tv with very little features, i would have waited til i got home and went to wally world. They tried to convince my wife it was a much better tv and was a huge upgrade. When she relayed to them that i am not a crackhead they were going to take advantage of, they offered a zenith instead. I still wasnt buying that load. So i had my wife call amazon customer service and ask if it was standard practice for 3rd parties to advertise and sell items on amazon that they dont have. And they said it wasnt there problem, we had to deal with the tv store. So now i will never buy anything from amazon ever again. And the tv store treated us to a free downgrade to the LT237HVS. How nice of them, now i am left with only 1 hdmi input, and a much cheaper and older tv with less features than the one i paid for. I am beside myself mad, its a real shame i have to turn in my weapon and ammunition before i get home. So even though i paid for this model tv, i will never get to own it.

DVDs look amazing, cartoons are so bright you need lights on to watch them or you will go blind. Lots of inputs I will never use. Want more positives, go read someone else. Want the skinny on the negs? It buzzes constantly, no matter what you do to the sound adjustments, it will buzz, forget trying to set the backlight to \"Bright\" the audio pays dearly for it. Even with the sound turned down to where you can't hear it, the buzz is there, loud as ever. Yeah, turning the backlight down helps, but then the TV is darker. I like it bright. OK, it's a minor thing, and for the price, I got mine for $980, small thing to complain about. BUT, after 8 months, the screen just went on me, I mean it is flickering like it wants to send me into a seizure. Picture is dark, screen is strobing, Tv is shot. From what I understand, Olevia has a problem with this in some of it's TVs. Hopefully the warranty is as good as everyone says. Get what you pay for, go buy a sony, at least they have someone at customer service to take care of you, and make sure you get an extended FULL REPLACEMENT warranty, not a repair warranty.","Date":"July 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Decent picture, TERRIBLE hissing noise and Poor Customer Service","Author":"Ryan Dunlop","ReviewID":"R1JJ6SMJTMUF6B","Overall":"bad","Content":"Ok so first I want to say, PLEASE save yourself the hassle and do not buy this TV. I purchased it at a fairly good discount price (here on Amazon) as my first LCD Flat Panel. When the TV arrived I was pretty happy, looked nice, worked fine.After a week or so of watching on my Olevia a few things bothered me. First, the mat black color around the screen is just boring and tacky looking. However, since the price was right...it wasent a huge deal.What WAS a huge deal was the terrible hissing noise coming from the speakers. Whenever I turned on the TV, regardless of if I put the cable box, xbox or DVD player on..it would Hiss! Some may not notice it, but once you hear it...you will never be able to watch the TV again without noticing.So I called up Syntax (after sending numerous e-mails trying to fix it, and calling tons of times) I finally got someone. They said it sounded like a problem that required a new TV and they would ship one out. They did rather quickly and it showed up the next week. I was very eager to have what I thought was a good TV now, and unpacked it. Once plugged in.....the NIGHTMARE began. Not only did this TV hiss like crazy as well, but the input for the DVD player (HMI) was totally shot!I called Syntax up right away, and told them that I needed a refund...it just wasent going to work. This time a rep told me that the hissing noise is just a quirk with the product line. Hmm would of been nice to know earlier!So they began to process my refund. It took nearly 2 months to finally get the refund check, and I put in countless hours of staying on top of Syntax to make it happen. Save yourself all the trouble and purchase another brand.I got a Sharp Aquos shortly after returning this one, and I could not be happier...it is a God send compared to the Olevia.","Date":"June 3, 2006"}

After filing a BBB and FTC complaint, Toshiba finally replaced my defective TV,( after 4.5 weeks in the shop) with the newer model 42HP66. There are a few differences. The 66 doesn't let you change the screen size, without loosing quality, or giving you the full 42\" on non HD channels/broadcasts. Possibly one of the reasons the 95 model kept crapping out on me. The built-in channel guide is also missing (not really needed,, since the cable co provides one)Seems the bad ones were purchased at SEARS.

Logical solution would be to tell the service guys \"Hey try this, this, & this but if they don't work then here is the part to take with you to install so we don't have the customer waiting & inconvenienced.\"But NOOOO, Sony don't give a damn about their customers. It's impossible to reach anyone at Sony apart from a telephonist at the customer service # & when you do get someone with authority they don't return your calls in a timely way & are inflexible, unhelpful & just plain unsympathetic or concerned with making customers happy. My advice? Don't buy Sony because if you have a problem with your appliance their service is almost nonexistent. Also don't buy any large appliance online. Buy it at a local store where you can easily return it if something goes wrong. Needless to say i will NEVER EVER buy Sony again!","Date":"September 13, 2006"}
{"Title":"Didn't last long...","Author":"Wyluli \"Wyluli Wolf\"","ReviewID":"RDMFLBUD87J3Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"****UPDATE**** - After spending $1000 to have this t.v. fixed, it was about 7 months later, and once again, POP - out goes the picture.  Zenith's products are a joke, and it's very clear that this particular product is defective and should have been recalled.  However Zenith would rather keep your $3000+ instead of stand behind their product.  It's no wonder Zenith changed their name to LG because they know that nobody will buy anything that says \"Zenith\" on it.  It's only a matter of time until people catch on to \"LG\" and they earn a bad reputation.  We also sent a very nasty e-mail to Zenith/LG about this, and have not heard squat in response.  Not so much as even a \"We're sorry you're unhappy with the product\".  Thanks for nothing Zenith.  I wish I could have my $4000 back, because less than 2 years from original date of purchase, this t.v. is going to the dumpster.  Would have been only a year if I hadn't had it repaired.Everything below is my original review:I bought this TV 1 year and 2 weeks ago.  Overall I was happy with the picture quality (although the blacks are really splotchy).  Unfortunately, I was watching TV when POP! there went the screen.  Of course the warranty was only for 1 year (even though the website states a 2 year warranty on Plasma TV's) so I just got screwed by 2 weeks.  Reading the other reviews I see out of only 7 reviews, at least one other person has had this happen as well.  This makes me really question the quality of this TV.  Do yourself a favor and buy a Sony or a panasonic or at least get a really long, extended service plan.  Getting burned for $3500 sucks.","Date":"December 5, 2006"}

{"Title":"Zenith Plazma TV Model Z50PX2D","Author":"R. Fowler","ReviewID":"R1AFAAZ9AS9PFM","Overall":"bad","Content":"Today I Googled my Zenith Plasma TV, model Z50PX2D for reviews. I was amazed at how many other people had the same experience that I have had with this TV. It was a great TV until about two days after the one year warranty expired. It's funny how Circuit City (were I bought the TV) had kept contacting us about getting an extended warranty. I kept declining, my thinking being, I spent $3,000.00 on a TV, I should be good for 10-20 years. Stupid!!! Two days after the one year warranty, we lost all picture on this TV, nothing but a black screen with audio. This was preceded by red sparkles being visible on black screens and sometimes during actual viewing of a picture. I called LG and at first they said too bad, the warranty was for one year. I was mad! I decided to try again a couple of days later and call them again. This time LG said, no, my warranty was for two years and they would replace this TV with a new one of the same model. This was unusual to me, seeing how they changed answers on their policy, on the second call I made to them. I asked them if our warranty would start over with the new TV and they said \"no\", we would be under our original one year warranty. I asked them if we could get a full refund and they said \"no\". I asked if they were aware of an ongoing problem with this model of TV and they said \"no\". I told them that I have bought TVs at pawn shops that have lasted 10 times as long as this one did.  The person who I was talking to at LG, laughed. He must have thought that this was funny. I for one, do not think this is funny. $3,000.00 is a lot of money too me and I can't believe that there has not been a recall on this model. Will the second TV do the same thing? If so, I have spent this money on a two year TV and LG will have a large problem on their hands - ME!","Date":"March 24, 2007"}

A few months after the one year warranty was up we hear a loud POP! TV goes black and then after repowering it up we only have a completely washed out screen. I google the problem and it turns out the majority of people who bought the Zenith Plasma TV's all have this problem eventually. They have defective circuit boards in their TV's and they continue to sell them, knowing they are defective!!!!Zenith's answer? You should have bought an extended warranty. So what they are telling you folks is that the two to three thousand dollar TV they sell you is basically only good for one year. Even if you buy the extended warranty you have to pay for the lab which can cost hundreds of dollars in the repairs. I have since talked to several Zenith plasma owners who have had to repair theirs three or four times now. One guy tells me he has spent five thousand dollars on his TV in three years.

After first saying NO, Zenith agreed to extend the warranty on the parts and I had the set repaired on 1/18/08.  Had to pay $214 for labor, but this was covered by AMEX, because of its policy to cover repairs double the mfrs. warranty up to one year.  Well, today, 3/5/08 the set blew again, same thing.  Zenith has agreed to cover the parts and the labor should still covered, hopefully, by the repair shop.  Even with Zenith trying to do the right thing, it is obvious that the inconvenience and poor quality is an issue.  Soon it will be two years and no one will cover the repairs.

However, just like in so many other stories, about 16 months after I bought it, the TV mad a couple of loud popping sounds, and I never saw anything on that screen again. Zenith (LG) support wasn't very helpful, short of directing me to local authorized repair shop.Given that it was out of warranty, I did not expect it would be just taken care of, but I honestly thought they would offer the board, and I'd gladly cover the labor. Given the number of similar reports, this has to be a manufacturing/QC problem, and hiding behind a (fairly short) warranty in these kinds of cases is not acceptable. That may be ok for a Walmart-brand $9.99 alarm clock, but not for $2500-3000 product (which was their discounted retail price at the time of purchase).I'd stay away from this particular model, and LG/Zenith plasmas in general (personally, I will stay away from their products period, but I can see how LCD line may be a different story).","Date":"December 17, 2008"}

{"Title":"Another victim of the POP!  Twice","Author":"Matthew A. Knop","ReviewID":"R26QDZUFONHDJG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this TV from Circuit City just under two years ago.  About 5 months ago it popped for the first time.  I did my internet research and discovered this common problem and contacted LG, who covered the parts expenses, I just had to cover the $350 for labor.  They said they would only cover these parts once, which screams to me they expected it to happen again.  Well, 5 months later it has popped again.  I can't possibly afford the module that needs to be replaced...again.  So now I have a $3000 piece of garbage.  Learn from me, don't buy Zenith or LG, they don't stand behind their products.  I defiantly learned the hard way.  Always get a reputable brand and always get the extended warranty even if you will have to fight tooth and nail to get the product covered (which you always do with extended warranty, it's still much cheaper than having to buy a new set every couple of years.  I'm now looking at Magnaovox and a few other brands...but never LG or Zenith again.","Date":"March 2, 2008"}

The set was repaired 2/08.  12/08 it popped again. LG will not authorize another repair because they repaired it once on an 'extended warranty agreement'.It is outrageous that the set was repaired with inferior or defective parts...the same parts (or at least the same issue) that caused the set to fail in the first place.I had read on a web-forum (so take it with a grain of salt) that he OEM and replacement boards were produced in Mexico, and recently LG has sourced them elswhere; but this is just hearsay.While it had a nice picture, and I enjoyed it while it lasted, this set has cost me a thousand dollars a year for ownership.  It will cost >$400 (if only the Z sustain board has to be replaced) or in excess of $1400 if the shop deems all four boards (z, y, power, and ?? boards) are to be replaced (as per mfg's recommendations).NOT a good return on the investment.","Date":"January 4, 2008"}

I received it on Dec 10 & it stopped working within less than 2 weeks!!! I contacted Amazon's customer service & they pretty much told me I was on my own & that this was something between me & the manufacturer as their return policy did not cover TVs over 27\"!!! Unfortunately I had not bothered to read this policy before buying online or I would never had made that mistake. Anyway, I set about contacting the manufacturer. After getting a run around for almost 10 days, one of their local service centers came & picked up the unit. It is now almost a month later & the unit is still at the service center awaiting parts. Apparently, it's the power supply & when I call the service center I am told that they have been advised by the manufacturer, Sylvania (Funai Corp) that the part is on order but cannot give them an estimated date!!! So while, the TV, does look good & had nice picture while it worked, the service is, needless to say, very poor. Lesson - do not buy such items online. Save yourself the hassle & buy it at a local store. You might pay a little more but atleast you can take it back to your local store & won't have to run around. Also, buy from a reputable brand (Panasonic, SONY) as the 3rd rate brands such a Sylvania simply can't provide the necessary support. They are in the business of making & selling products - not supporting them. It's a shame.","Date":"January 23, 2006"}

I read every single review and apart from some people saying the sound sucked  was pretty pleased.  I'm not one of those people that's crazy about their home theater systems anyways so it not being HD and possibly having poor sound was okay by me.  The first tv came and as the delivery guys unwrapped it they revealed a completey smashed screen even though the box appeared fine.  I was bummed and they said to write amazon and request a replacement.  I did, and amazon was very quick with processing my request, the second tv just arrived about an hour ago.  The box was completely torn apart in one of the corners so I was already nervous.  The tv looked undamaged and the guy was in a hurry to leave so i signed the paper and then hooked it up.  I only remember reading about a humming sound in one of the reviews but it's very bad in my tv.  As soon as I plugged in the audio cable the humming started and it gets louder as you turn the tv up, very distracting.  Every time I changed channels flashes of static come on the screen which is not because of the cable box because it doesn't do it on any other of my tvs i hooked it up to.  I looked at the back of the tv and there is a dent.  I don't know if it's because of damage or just a sucky tv but either way i'm getting a refund and feel like i've wasted a month on this ordeal.  Please take my advice, I know it's a good deal, but you do get what you pay for.  There's just no telling what goes on during the delivery.  I'm gonna go to a store and get a better brand name and pick it up myself.  If you do buy I hope you have better luck than me.","Date":"January 31, 2007"}

At the moment it is sitting in the authorized repair center for a month already and that repair center can not get from Funai (Sylvania is their brand name) any reply, not to phone calls, not to email. Same happens with my phone calls, NEVER a live person on the phone. So after a month repair center does not even have ETA on parts they need, they cannot even find out if Funai has these parts. Funai totally ignores their customers and the repair centers they supposed to service. I had no clue that support like this can exist. Absolutely the worst company I had to deal with.

{"Title":"Think twice ...","Author":"Robert","ReviewID":"R15DPQYGSOU1Z7","Overall":"bad","Content":"First off, on a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a -5. Here's why;To begin this unit will cost you $200.00 to ship and since it is over the 27\" return policy size don't expect to be able to return it if it's defective.You will never get your $200.00 back or have the unit replaced unless of course there is a forklift hole through it or something obvious like that. Amazon \"cuts and runs\" and leaves the unit to you and the manufacturer who is supposed to have \"in-home-service\" if the unit is found to be defective after you unpack it and try to use it.Well, you better check the Funai warranty to find out if they even have a service center in your area that can come out to your home (which you will have to do yourself because when my unit showed up on my doorstep D.O.A. I called them and they could not locate anyone in my area. I had to call the Funai service number and press \"2\" to find the nearest service center which, BTW, was just about 40 min away. I found it astonishing that the service folk at Funai couldn't find one...what kind of service center doesn't have a list of \"ceritfied\" service centers for there call center? I find it odd that a technical company doesn't have a database of these centers for the call center to use... ?!?!?!)We bought this unit as a surprise gift for the holiday and received it on Dec 7th, I checked the unit immediately to make sure it was ok (which is why we got it early!). After finding that the unit was D.O.A., I called the mfg right away, and guess what...? I had to leave a message. Wow. Now there's some customer service. Well after a day and a half I got no return call, so I persistently kept calling the service number and finally got to talk to a human (BTW, the message got responded to 3 days later.). They told me I had to get a replacement from Amazon (which seemed odd because of their return policy but I contacted them about it anyway). I sent Amazon an email and they directed me to the web page regarding the return policy. I replied asking them to push the mfg for some resolution and they said sorry we sympathize with you but we can't help you.Gee thanks for the sympathy card but, for a $1000.00 I expected a little more. Maybe on Dec 25th they could come and sing Kumbyah with me and my family and make us feel all warm and fuzzy?(I don't mean to sound materialistic but, I am tired of people taking my hard-earned money and handing me junk in return with no path to resolve an issue in a reasonable manner.)As of this writing (Dec 14th) I still have not seen or even heard from my local service \"certified\" center. I am completely unimpressed with there customer service and have no faith in the product or there ability to support it. Thanks Funai and Amazon for a wonderful holiday. My year long savings gone and my surprise gift is a bust. Right now I am sitting on a paper warranty worth $1000.00.Do yourself a favor and spend a few dollars more and buy your next TV from a locally trusted store. You will have a better chance at getting some courteous and prompt service if in the event you should need it. Also make sure you buy a unit from a different mfg. Buy from someone who knows what customer service is about. Funai really doesn't care all that much if you spent a grand on their product. They'll take your money and complacently get around to you and your silly problem on their terms.","Date":"December 14, 2005"}

{"Title":"Needed service after 1 1/2 year","Author":"MATT","ReviewID":"R3BUA8ZDF7KNDM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned this monitor for about a year and half, and overall it's been very enjoyable. It's used as a PC/TV monitor. Why the 2 stars then? Because after about a year a sparkling red pixel appeared and has remained in the lower left half of the screen. As far as I know there is not a remedy for this. This might sound minor but it can be distracting while watching a HD feature within about 10' of the screen. Also for the record, it bothers me, but not the wife. If anyone knows a cure for a pixel fix for a *plasma*, please comment to this review!The other disappointing thing was about 2 weeks ago I stepped out of the room while the TV was running and returned 5 minutes later to find the picture became very grainy and dark. I turned off the TV and turned it back on only to hear a clicking noise as if the TV was trying to turn on, but could not.The good news is that this monitor came with a 2 year warranty. It was quite easy to get a Sony registered tech to come to the house after a quick online search(Within a week). After describing the incident to the tech over the phone, he ordered the parts he felt necessary to repair the panel and we scheduled a appointment once Sony sent him the parts. He replaced some boards in the monitor and it's back up and running as it was. Initially, the sparkling red pixel seemed to disappear after this repair; however, it seemed to re-appear about an hour after he left. It probably never left and just went un-noticed as it only appears during the transmissions of certain colors. From the bit of research I did, it would appear that this is a manufacturing defect of sorts. Also, because only one pixel affected, it's not covered under warranty. In fact, in the instruction booklet it list this as being somewhat normal, specifically red, green, and blue pixels. That is why it's important to make sure that there is a return policy of sorts that won't hurt your wallet when you purchase this monitor.Some other thoughts are a stand or wall mount can easily add another $100-$300 to the price, and you might consider a consumer version of a plasma with a built in HD tuner or speakers. Personally I use this with my cable box tuner and surround sound speakers, and had no need for another version.Using Component, or HDMI with HD programming is simply awesome, while the other inputs(s-video, composite, etc) are disappointing.This monitor has an dvi port which means you needs to buy a dvi to hdmi cable, or buy the optional hdmi input module.The remote looked like it would come with a $30 tv and looks cheaper then most $9 remotes in stores.My first choice at the time was a Panasonic TH-50PH8UK, which seemed to be the way to go after reading countless positive reviews. However it was on backorder just about everywhere for months, and I lost patience and went with this.Shortly after I bought the Sony, I also bought a Panasonic TH-42PH9UK(the next generation of Panasonic) for the bedroom and love it. I love them both, but have always liked the Panny more because it's setup is more user friendly, and it has been more reliable. Also, the Panasonic reads the incoming signal faster and sometimes the Sony takes a while to display the signal from the cable box. The pictures of both are pretty identical, and beat any LCD I've owned or viewed.The last thought is you should have someone home who is capable of lifting the plasma as every unit I've received has been delivered by only one person. It's best to have two people at home capable of lifting though, as it's not the job of the delivery person to carry the plasma for you. However, all the delivery people I've dealt with have helped me get the monitor inside even though curbside is the norm. They even helped unpack it to make sure it wasn't damaged.","Date":"June 27, 2007"}

Of course he also mentioned noise is common for plasma screen.  Today I found out that regular phone only carry frequency up to 4 Khz.  That buzzing sound is for sure way above that therefore he won't be able to hear anything.  I will call them again to see if they will stand behind their product.Other than buzzing sound, it's a great tv.  I agreed with another posting that you should wait until next batch arrived.

As others have reported I was very pleased with the picture and other elements of this product.The other day the TV just died. No problem, I thought. It's still under warranty. I can call them, and they'll send out someone to repair it. I called Samsung support, and they created a repair ticket. They said they would call me back when their service locator was available. That took two days....a little irritating that it took that long to get me the name of a service center in my area that could perform the work, but it was nothing compared to the frustration to follow.I called the service center to setup an appointment for the technician to come out, but they said \"sorry, you are out of our service area. We can't come out.\" I called Samsung support back and asked for a service center in my area. They stated there weren't any. HUH??? I live 25 miles outside of the 8th largest city in the U.S. (San Diego) and the only service center in my area is 60 miles outside of San Diego proper? That didn't seem right, so I called again and had another support person check. No....that is the closest one, and did I mention they don't service my area!!! The only recourse Samsung was able to offer was they would have to submit paperwork to get \"executive approval\" to have someone from the service center sent out for the repair. This would take 7 to 10 BUSINESS DAYS. Are you f@!*%$$& kidding me!!!??? That is completely unacceptable. I can't imagine any company having the arrogance to suggest such a thing to a customer...\"sure, we'll get back to you in a couple of weeks.\" No thanks, I think I'll take my business elsewhere. I immediately asked to speak with someone higher up to get this problem escalated. The support person connected me with Executive level support, but they were just as ineffectual, saying the best they could do was to mark the request as urgent. I think we know how much that is going to change things.Obviously, Samsung has a process that is almost completely broken. To make a customer wait up to two weeks to have a repair ticket approved is mind numbingly ridiculous. Add to that the time it may take to complete the repair, and it could conceivably add up to three weeks or more. This is what I spent $2,400 for? Samsung will never see another penny from this consumer, and I'll do my best to steer other potential customers away from such egregious customer service.","Date":"September 24, 2007"}

I've already tried replacing the Y board and the Main board, but the service tech said the panel is bad. Given the fact that Samsung claims the following: It's rated for a 60,000-hour panel life (6 hours of usage a day for 27 years), I'd say that is a reach. I figured it would last 10 years, but 2 1/2? I won't be investing in any Samsung products any time soon.I would recommend an extended warranty as the reliablity claims are worthless if the quality control is terrible.

Typically this memory is not intrusive if you limit your time on channels like ESPN or other channels with tickers or graphics.  After seven months this TV ghosts so bad that it has a lingering burn image after watching the loacal TV news.  That's right, the trasitory graphics from local news leaves a ghost image.  Even worse the pixels do not release the image and the TV displays red and green noise after the image is gone or in dark scenes DURING A MOVIE.  If the movie cuts from bright to dark the pixels don't release and there is red and green \"snow\" in all the dark areas.  This is after seven months of careful and light use.  The money you save for Plasma over LCD is not worth it with this set.  I would love to go back and undue this buy.  I have a lot of experience with plasmas at work as well as at home.

The service people are now trying to blame the wiring in my house or the cable equipment(again).  Samsung has to this point refused to give me an exchange or refund my money. Seven weeks after purchasing this product in good faith, all that I have to show for it are an increased cable bill (for high def) and a mounting plate on the wall where the tv should be.

This is a very common problem (see  [...] This is a very loud buzz that can be heard anywhere in a room, even when you turn the volume of your receiver up. After waiting almost a month for a repair, a Samsung repairman came over and said that the set needed to be replaced. He also indicated that Samsung knew that there was a buzzing problem with plasmas (including the 50 inch) made during a specific period at the Mexico plant (and I was the third replacement that he had recommended). He indicated that Samsung would contact me about the replacement set and that it should take a couple of weeks.After a week of waiting for a call, I called Samsung today and the rep said that they had no record of any replacement set being authorized. Apparently in their computer, my case said \"resolved\" and that the tech had determined the error was with the cable box which he had adjusted. After voicing my extreme displeasure with this response he said he would contact the tech and get back to me. He called back after about 15 minutes and said that I was correct, the tech had confirmed that my set needed to be replaced, BUT the tech had not filed his Service Action Work order (SAW). Samsung could thus not replace the set until the SAW was filed with them, and they could not control when the tech did this. Once the SAW was sent in, I should expect a replacement in around 10 days. I explained that I had waited almost a month for a service visit (too long for me to return the set to the store, which has a two week replacement policy), and had already waited one week for Samsung to get back to me. Now they were saying that I still had to wait for the SAW to be filed (which could take any length of time) and also faced an additional 10 day wait beyond this.I then asked to speak to a supervisor and discovered that things were much worse than I had feared. I was put onto Erin. She recited Samsung policy as follows:- After the SAW is filed the Regional Service Manager makes a decision about whether to replace the set or not. This takes 7 to 10 days. She had no real response to the question of how they could over-rule a tech that THEY had sent out. So I still don't actually know for sure that the set will be replaced.- If they agree to replace the set (which I had assumed they had, given the tech's assurance), it takes up to 5 days for them to contact the customer to confirm replacement.- It then takes 10-15 days to receive a replacement set.I mentioned that given that they now knew that the tech had advised that a replacement should happen, she as a supervisor should short circuit the process and set in motion the replacement delivery. No such luck - she had a script and was not going to deviate. The Regional Service Manager would make the call, end of story.So the bottom line, avoid this set until you are sure that the buzzing problem has been sorted out.","Date":"October 31, 2006"}

I'm told by experts it's a good TV, assuming you don't watch something on 4:3 ratio for more than 2 hours at a time. The screen burns lines along the side, showing up when you watch something in wide screen. And get this... it's not covered by the warranty! While Samsung says there are things you can do to help 'fix' this, the fact that this happens should be unacceptable for any consumer. The vast majority of TV programming is still in 4:3 ratio and it's not ideal to stretch everything out just for the sake of the TV's health. I also don't care that this is covered in the manual, common knowledge among TV geeks, or that this isn't specific to Samsung TVs (it may even be common for most plasmas and LCDs). To protect the consumer, there should be an on-screen warning or something far more obvious than text in the manual.So be warned if you intend to purchase this, or any other wide-screen TV for that matter.

The set arrived in great condition two hours before the UM vs. Ohio State game (great timing).  The picture is amazing and I was completely satisfied until the set started \"buzzing\" about 6 hours after I turned it on.I called Samsung to complain and they quickly sent out a technician.  After changing the power supply, which didn't help at all, the technician called Samsung who explained that Plasmas inherently \"buzz\" and I should sit further away from the tv.  Psh, are you serious?  I spend $1400 on supposedly one of the \"best\" plasma manufacturers around and this is the customer service I get?  I'd expect this from a Wal-Mart plasma, but not a Samsung.Bottom Line:  Clearly, Samsung makes a great tv, as you can tell from the many wonderful reviews on this site.  I'm just warning that this \"buzzing\" glitch is not cleared up yet and you too may fall victim.  Its not like I'm trying to score a new tv here.  Mine is only 4 days old, and as much as I enjoy leaving the office to wait for the technician between the hours of 1 and 3, I'd much rather have a tv that performs as plasmas should.Best Bet:  Buy the 42 inch Panasonic plasma for the same price - less the \"buzzing\"","Date":"November 22, 2006"}
{"Title":"Big headache, buy another HDTV.","Author":"Scott Cohen","ReviewID":"ROQ2VM5UPIWG9","Overall":"bad","Content":"My family has been considering an HDTV for nearly two years now, and the prices for them have gone down considerably. We felt that it was the right time to jump in and buy one. I did research online and compared a lot of DLPs, LCDs and plasmas sets. We decided against the DLP because of it's size and picture quality at certain angles.We decided to go with plasma and picked up this Samsung set. We got a great price on it and we were really excited about it. We finally get the set home, take it out of the box, set it up, and... nothing. Nothing happens. We plug it in, set up our HD set top box and the TV has no picture! We tried to troubleshoot it but nothing happened. We thought the TV broke en route to our home.We called Samsung's technical support, and they had someone come out to fix it a week later. The repairman came and replaced some part in the TV. Wow, the TV looked great! I watched a concert in HD and watched a football game in HD. Then, the set broke down, 3 hours after being repaired! There were artifacts all over the screen, and the colors became washed out and green. At first, I thought there was an issue with the HD feed. We changed the channels but oddly enough the TV was displaying everything wrong. We called Samsung again and they came back out to repair it. An hour after they left, the same problem came back, but now, a string of pixels in the middle showed as green and red. The TV died again. The repairman came back three times in one day to \"fix\" it but nothing. We contacted the store where we purchased it and they refunded us and we chose a Panasonic 42\" plasma. It arrived today, and it worked out of the box, like it should.Samsung is a reputable brand but I would have second thoughts before buying another Samsung television. We may have just gotten a lemon, but after four repairs, it was unacceptable. I would buy another set. We had a heavy paperweight sitting in our living room for a month and Samsung refused to replace the entire set. Thankfully the store empathized with us and let us get a new TV. This TV was a big headache... buy something else!","Date":"November 17, 2006"}

The picture was great until this weekend when I noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non-hd broadcasts. Samsung's tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty. The commercial hype by Samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help. Samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real % of their sets which experience the problem. My friends have Panasonics which have never had the problem even after 3 years usage.","Date":"April 9, 2007"}

I did my shopping and Samsung is a respected brand. This TV has some nice features. However I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality on this TV. After the initial \"ooh and ahh\" of watching television in HD wore off, I was left feeling like I'd wasted an awful lot of money. The picture on HD stations is \"pixally\" especially when there is movement in the picture. Football games were the worst. The TV doesn't seem to read the signal fast enough to provide a crisp HD experience. The TV also distorts skin tones. I spent hours upon hours adjusting the color and settings but never found anything that made me feel I'd made a good investment. Pay the extra money and get the Pioneer. I found that the difference between the Samsung and the Pioneer was as big as the difference between non-HD and HD quality. I now use the same signal and same HD box but with the different TV and I get TERRIFIC picture and sound quality.","Date":"November 14, 2006"}
{"Title":"42 inch plasma samsung tv caught on fire","Author":"Lori C","ReviewID":"R2ICLU0IGET3EW","Overall":"bad","Content":"We purchased our tv in Dec 2006 for $1699 plus tax.  In July 2012, our 5 1/2 year old tv caught on fire.  When the technician came out to look at it- he told me that they no longer coat the part that caught on fire with plastic for this reason. Samsung apologized for our tv catching on fire and was glad that noone was hurt, but that was the extent of their compensation for our tv catching on fire.  The tv had a 5 year warranty and it was just out of warranty.  I think it is horrific that they knew there was a problem, but did nothing to recall the tvs that were out there.  It is extremely scarey to have your tv catch on fire and I am extremely disappointed in the way they handled it.  We dealt with their ECR, which is the executive customer relations.  We will never buy another samsumg product in our household.","Date":"July 18, 2012"}

{"Title":"The picture was great for awhile. Turned into junk after a few years.","Author":"Dime the Reviewer","ReviewID":"R10LD4GUPBH5PB","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this TV in 2006. Shortly after I experienced a \"diffusion problem\" aka \"blue sparkles\". I had it serviced under warranty and tech replaced the entire panel. I wish they would have given me a different TV though. This did remedy the first problem.The TV had a great picture. It died in 2010 outside of the extended warranty. It developed these massive pixelated lines across all sources and channels. The lines made the TV unusable.Upon researching the problem, the solution is most likely a panel replacement. I'm unsure if you can even do that now since the TV is so old. When I had the first panel replaced it was $1000 which Samsung paid for (warranty).I gave the TV away for 100 bucks.PROS: TV displays 1080i which is rare for a \"720p\" set. I bought this when 1080p was very new and nothing was using it. We are still unfortunately far away from full use of 1080p (over the air, tv etc). The glossy black border was a nice touch. No swivel stand but this wasn't typical for Plasmas in 2006.CONS: Screen is INCREDIBLY reflective. Light bounces off like a window. I have a new plasma which has a coating that reduces glare. It's night and day to this set.BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. The Plasma is VERY loud. You have to turn the volume up significantly to overcome it. My 50 inch is quieter. This must have come with technology advancements. This sucker is heavy and must weigh 100 lbs. My 50 inch plasma is actually lighter.. The TV also gets very hot. Much hotter then my 50 inch.This TV was marred with problems. Google and you will find. Most common now is people find that it shuts off and won't turn back on.I stuck with Samsung for my replacement TV for the living room and bedroom. I hope this was just a one off thing for them and the others will last much longer. I was close to dumping them but Sony burned me harder with product failures so I avoided them.DON'T buy this TV used. It's a ticking timebomb.","Date":"January 4, 2011"}

About 3 months after purchase It developed a hum in the audio on the component connections. Called Samsung and they sent someone out who took the TV away and repaired it. Came back and had it now had a hum on the output side (going to the receiver) and 4 months later it also developed a problem with the screen (blue spot on the bottom left hand side). Called Samsung again. They sent out yet another (non Samsung Authorized repair center). They've had the TV now for over 15 days and no update from them. My advice to you is don't count on Samsung repair. They are worthless. Also, it should be known that this TV does not support variable output on the sound so you'll always have to adjust at the receiver (just a note). If the TV worked correctly, I'd probably give it a better review. It is nice, but if you have problems at all, you'll be in trouble. Buyer beware!!!

I've decided to replace the faulty capacitors myself, just like many others who have had this issue (search for \"samsung lcd tv repair capacitor\" on youtube for examples).  I will not be purchasing any more Samsung products, however.  A $1400 television set (the price when I bought it) should last longer.","Date":"July 29, 2011"}

Sherman","ReviewID":"R3T1OOQ0DTBK6Z","Overall":"bad","Content":"In fall of 2006 I paid $1150 at Best Buy very excited about the new technology. I also thought at the time like televisions of the past, it may last more then 3 years. Or that it could be fixed if it broke. After the second year the power board acted up. The tv blinked on and off instructions said it over heated. It resolved itself a few months later, but the warranty ended 6 months prior. Keep in mind I have the best Monster Surge protector. It had the features and benefits before broadcast went digital. I was waiting for broadcast tech to catch up to my LCD TV. 2008 TV goes digital, I got 18 months of HDMI television and the power board burned out. Dead. I took it to Stanton Repairs, self proclaimed the honest guys who fix TVs. 2 weeks later these guys are stumped. It can not be fixed. I am shocked. A TV has such a short life span? I am a fan of Samsung but they don't stand behind their product. The disclaimer I got from customer service said in 2006, the technology was so new we gave you 90 days plus one year parts and labor. After 3 years of normal home use, Samsung had no idea what would fail. Stanton had my TV for 2 weeks with no phone calls or no news. I was told maybe 1 day, 2 days, 5 days. 2 weeks later I got the phone call. Buy a new TV. I will never ever buy a Samsung LCD TV.","Date":"October 15, 2009"}

After purchasing the tv and hooking it up to my Replay via the SVIDEO input, the picture quality was poor with far to much pixelation. Tried all the different screen modes to no avail. Returned the tv the same day as I am not ready to retire my replay units. This tv may be fine for HD (which is the picture they have on display in the store), but if you are going to hook up older video equipment to it that outputs SVIDEO or composite video, you will be disapointed with the picture. The pixelation on these inputs becomes annoying whether you are 3 ft away or 6. I had much higher hopes for this tv.","Date":"October 1, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great TV, great bargain, but maybe not the best for picky gamers","Author":"B. Lama","ReviewID":"R26N87NZQD3UT0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Okay first let me say that most everything the other reviewers have said about this TV is true. I too saw this TV on display at Circuit City side by side with other LCD flat panels from Sony, Sharp and others, and looking at them all running the same video the Samsung picture quality was as good as or better than any of them, to my eyes. The only other TV's that were even close were the Sony (didn't look as good as the Samsung, but cost several hundred more), and a higher end Samsung of the same size (a couple hundred more for increased contrast ratio from 3000:1 to 4000:1, I can't say I saw a difference).The price was fantastic for this type of TV with the features it has. Circuit City just happened to have one available as an \"Open Box Deal\", a customer return or something to that effect. The TV was still in brand spanking new condition, still had the remote, manual, and everything, just no box, and I got it for $200 off their list price, so I payed about $1200. I expected to be paying more like $1500-1800 for a 32\" LCD HDTV to get a nice picture, so I went home that day very pleased with my purchase.Well... the TV is great and will probably satisfy 95% of people out there who want to upgrade to HDTV and/or flat panel. I, unfortunately, am one of the other 5%.The problem for me is that I primarily bought the TV to play video games on. And I am very picky about the picture when I'm playing games. Little things that might not bother most people can be a real annoyance to me.Issue #1 - Though much improved over what I was used to seeing with older LCD monitors, and even with Samsung boasting a lightning-fast repsonse time of 8ms (one of the fastest I've seen advertised, only the Aquos is advertised faster that I know of at 6ms), there was still VERY noticeable blurring of finer details when things were moving. I hooked up an Xbox 360 and ran a first person game (Elder Scrolls: Oblivion for you gamers), which is a gorgeous and VERY finely detailed game. In an outdoor scene, I immediately noticed that when I would move, all the fine details like all of the individual leaves on trees or blades of grass would go out of focus very noticeably. And then when I would stop moving it would take a split second for everything to get back in focus. Even my wife, who is about 10,000x less picky about things like that and often doesn't notice things I complain about on TV pictures, asked why it was doing that before I even pointed it out to her! A sign to me that it is actually something the average person will notice easily.Issue #2 - While this TV does offer a very high contrast ratio (3000:1 claimed) that does look very good in scenes where you have a very bright colorful scene or a mixed light and dark colored scene, I found that it does NOT look good on primarily dark scenes. If the scene is mostly dark with just a small portion of light/colorful/white elements, the lighter elements will appear cloudy or greyish. Perfect example, I popped in Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2, and the first screen is all black with one line of large white text in the center, and the white text should be a bright bright white, instead it was a dingy light grey. Another example from the same game, when you are viewing the car buying screen where the background is mostly black and dark grey, a bright colored car like a yellow or red will appear washed out or greyish instead of vibrant.Which seems to be an effect of Issue #3... What it appears to me is that the backlight of the LCD trys to adapt by adjusting brighter for mostly bright scenes and dimming for mostly darker scenes. It is very noticeable when the scene shifts rapidly from dark to light, you will see the scene shift, and then a split second later you will see the whole screen brightness level very suddenly change.This 'blinking' along with the fact that a mostly dark screen with colorful elements will show the colors to be washed out and very low contrast looking means that, although you are USUALLY getting a great, high contrast and very vibrant picture, in the end it is a very unconsistently great picture. Add to that the blurring effect and I am very unsatisified with this TV as far as playing games on it. And I have spent HOURS adjusting every possible setting for the picture with no luck of alleviating these issues.I am left to wonder if maybe this TV isn't maybe defective in some way, hence why it was an \"Open Box Deal\" to begin with. BUT, I have done a lot of reading online since buying this TV and found that at least the issue of the blurring seems to be a well known and commonly accepted issue with LCD's. As I said, I just be one of the extreme minority of picky consumers. As far as the blinking issue, the way it happens it seems to be a purposeful design, not some type of defect.Lastly, I should mention that I am also a fan of older video games (think Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis), and when I hooked a couple of these older systems up to this TV the picture just looked horrible, but I think this is just an effect of running a very low resolution image on such a high resolution TV, which is something you hear people complain about when viewing regular, non digital TV signals on HDTV's as well, so is not really a fault of this particular TV.Now, with all that having been mentioned, I will say that when I popped in a couple DVD movies, the TV performed beautifully, very nice, sharp, colorful picture. Were I only a movie buff who wanted a nice 'home theater' experience but didn't have space or money for one of the truly large HDTV's, this TV would work perfectly. So for anyone who is just looking for exactly that, watching and movies and regular TV, I would rate the TV a 5 for having a wonderful picture, great features, tons of inputs, and being an excellent value.But for playing video games, I can only rate the TV a 2. And since I rarely ever even watch TV, and I use my TV probably 80% for video gaming, I am unhappy and will be returning this TV today and getting a large screen Sony Wega CRT TV. The Wega line, by the way, still has what I consider to be the BEST picture available for any type of gaming. I had a 27\" Wega for five years and absolutely loved it.","Date":"August 2, 2006"}

{"Title":"Really meant 5 Stars - Great Smaller/Cheaper HDTV!","Author":"Sandra C.","ReviewID":"R1NAICT5PR9MSD","Overall":"bad","Content":"Why 2 stars? I could not update it - at first I had trouble getting the HD setup but once I figured that out (I am not a techie) it is spectacular.This is a great entry to HDTV since it is a great price/quality and had 2 HDMI slots - a rarity!  The picture is crisp and breathtaking with HDTV.  The HD movie channels are amazing. Each HD channel for network TV seems to display their shows in various screen formats, which is annoying, but that is not the TV.I bought this at BestBuy December 9th, 2006 and choose the 324 instead of the 325 model that has the 4000:1 contrast ratio because I didn't think there was a big enough difference for the extra $200+ I would have to pay and I like the styling of the 324 better.  (At BB I had a 12% discount for Rewards Club members so it was $1029 before tax - Amazon has it at $900 something with free shipping but I didn't want to hassle with a shipping return.)I'm not a TV/techie type but when I learned how to do it, setup was easy (and yes, it does a few seconds for TV to turn on). When I bought the TV BB told me to see any channels in HD I had to have an HD cable box.  Comcast in Baltimore City had set me up with regular digital cable when I moved in but it was an HD capable box (HDMI input in back) so all I had to do was call Comcast and upgrade to HD cable ($5 extra) and then hook up with the HDMI cable and disconnect the regular coax cable.  FYI - if you sign up for HD cable at Best Buy they take $50 off your TV.  I bought the $99 Monster HDMI 4' cable there too for convenience.It's light enough for me to carry in the box so I didn't have to pay the $50 delivery or setup fee (also free on Amazon).  Everyone complains about the sound, but it seems fine to me - but I am not used to surround sound anyway.  Hope this helps! : )","Date":"December 10, 2006"}

{"Title":"What a disappointment","Author":"T. Nguyen","ReviewID":"R4OMEVRZOWXKI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was looking for a TV for the bedroom that was similar to my Philips 42in LCD ($[...] at Costco) that has a built in ATSC tuner, which is supposedly the same as a HDTV tuner. (In addition to my regular cable channels, I get over 300 digital channels including radio stations with my 42in Philips...which is great because I love the KQED Life channel.) This Samsung model seemed to have what I was looking for. Good price, good quality, and most important an ATSC tuner. What actually made me choose the Samsung over the Philips 32PF7421D or the LG 32LC2D was that it had a PIP feature and I was able to find a price match on Amazon and got it for ~$[...] with tax. (It's on sale now for $1100)So, first, the Tuner doesn't work without an antenna. I suppose I can get an over-the-air antenna but the channels are limited in this area and KQED Life isn't one of the channels I'd be able to get [...] OR pay Comcast $[...]/month for the HD service and receiver, but that means having additional hardware to enjoy this TV. Which means, I could have been better off saving more money by getting an LCD monitor instead of an LCD TV because I can't even use the HDTV Tuner with my current configuration. (Now I'm comparing the Samsung to my 17\" wide screen Sharp LCD TV Monitor I use as my computer monitor. It's just the same. It has a PIP feature, component slots and composite slots.) And unlike the Philips, which integrates the digital channels with the analog channels for continuous surfing, you'd have to switch between surfing the analog channels then to the antenna channels with an additional button.Second, the PIP. It doesn't work with analog signals (unless the PIP is the PC or a HDMI signal.) So, that means you can't watch two different shows at the same time. Even if you had a digital signal, you wouldn't be able to watch two different digital channels either. There goes enjoying more than one sports game on HD during the sports seasons! What a disappointment. It's mainly for HDMI signals with a digital channel or for the use of the PC connection and the TV.So, either the 42\" Philips has a hidden antenna inside that's picking up all those extra channels or this Samsung is lacking. I'm returning this tomorrow and heading to Costco. Might just downgrade even further to a 32\" Sceptre, but at least I'll save $[...] and will have my HD and digital channels without any additional hardware. And if I'm disappointed with that, at least I didn't spend $[...].Would I recommend this? No. BUT, if you don't mind a PIP feature that's not completely PIP or getting an antenna to receive limited over-the-air channels, or getting the HD service with an additional box to add to your collection of DVD player, VCR, XBox, DVR, and Receiver, go for it.","Date":"March 4, 2007"}

They appear too wide and there is NO adjustment for this (according to the manual) which is crazy for a tv that cost this much. The other problem that won't bother too many people is  a missing feature for pc input. The manual claims this model has this feature yet the menu will not allow you to select it as a source (with or without a pc connected). It is grayed out and if you look at Samsung's website you will see this is a common complaint that is mentioned in the faq yet no mention on how to actually solve it.

I eventually escallated to Samsung corporate by looking up their NJ Offices and asking to speak to the VP of Marketing / Customer Service. I was routed to the specialized corporate customer care group and STILL got the run around. A Samsung Customer Service Manager eventually offered to sell me a TV for MORE THAN I COULD BUY IT IN THE STORE!!!!!!! How INSULTING! UNBELIEVEABLE is the only way to describe how INEPT their Service processes and groups are. They supposedly use the Six Sigma approach to quality... I can tell you with Samsung - they only give lip service to quality and customer service. I have NEVER been more disappointed with a company than with Samsung.","Date":"January 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"Slow Shipping on Free Ship","Author":"JB \"JB\"","ReviewID":"R3UM3SWLDVXS07","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is not a product review, since I have not recieved the TV yet.I ordered this TV from Amazon on 9/8 and recieved notification that I had a scheduled delivery on 9/20-9/26. OK not to bad I can wait a little. This item was in their wareshouse, so a third party transaction should not be a problem.I recieved my \"order shipped\" today 9/12.  OK, 3 days to process it.Here's the issue, The scheduled delivery date is now 10/2 from Eagle Truckers. I have not talked to the shipper yet, but will tomorrow. If I had known that it would take close to a month to get the TV, I may not have ordered it from them. Prices are falling fast and I am not sure that it will be such a good deal by the time I get it.I will update this post as things change.Update.I talked to the shipper and now I am scheduled for delivery on 9/19, so maybe all is OK. I guess you can't go by the delivery dates quoted.Will update again when recieved.Update: 9/22/06Received TV on 9/19. No dead pixels. There is always a chance of buying something online and dealing with the return poilicy on over 27\" TV's. Fortunately I have not had an issue yet. Don't look forward with having to deal with Samsung for service. I saved about $220 plus the sales tax from buying retail. So if your really price conscious, then you should take the chance. I know that if I had a problem with dead pixels or speakers not working, then I would have just took it back to the store.As far as what I ahve seen on the TV itself...It has excellent HDTV and DVD quality. I am hook up to HD cable box and get anywhere from 720p to 1080i on HD channels..amazing picture.Do not expect analog signals to look as good as a tube TV. Digital channels are just average. So it depends or your source input.I am having trouble using HDMI input, it can't find the signal. At this point I don't know if its my cable box, the HDMI cable or the TV. From what I have seen, there isn't much difference in quality vs component input anyway. The HDMI will be useful for the DVD upconverter I will be getting.Another reason I bought this was for PC input via VGA. It displays 1366 x 768, 1024 x 768 and 800 x 600. Only the highest resouliton keeps the aspect ratio correct, so make sure your graphics card does. I have a good card so mine does and I watch a DVD from the PC and it was beautiful.I am also using it as a monitor for the PC when siitng on a couch 10 feet away, with wireless keyboard and mouse. It a little strain on my eyesite, but I need glasses. For normal vision it is not an issue. You cannot use PIP between PC and component or HDMI inputs.Overall I am please with this purchase, but I have not has the issues that are mentioned elsewhere.Hope this helps.","Date":"September 12, 2006"}

{"Title":"Developed Picture Problems after 5 Months","Author":"Gregory L. Dauria \"daurigl\"","ReviewID":"R2KHNYLAMG0VAU","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is the fourth Sony television that I have owned.  Currently, we have a 57 inch XBR CRT Rear Projector in the home theater room, a 36 Trinitron direct view CRT in the living room, and most recently the 32 inch Bravia (subject of this review) in the master bedroom.  We also recently purchased a brand new Sony T9 Cybershot camera.  I have also purchased three Sony camcorders over the years.  The point of the aforementioned is that Sony has always delivered quality electronics and I have stayed with their products in return.When I first purchased the 32 inch LCD Bravia everything worked very well and it appeared to be another fine product.  After approximately 5 months of operation the television developed - for lack of better technical description - a pixel problem. A permanent dark splotchy image appeared on the left hand side of the screen.  At first the image was hardly noticeable, but then intensified to the point that it could be readily seen in all video formats.To be fair to Sony, this is the first problem that I have experience with a new product.  When I called customer support, I was told to take the TV to an authorized service center, but since there are no service centers within 30 miles of my residence, Sony offered to replace the TV with a refurbished unit.  I was not pleased that my relatively new TV was going to be replaced with such a unit, but since it carried the same warranty and Sony assured me that it would appear and work like new, I agreed to the exchange.The first indication that something may be wrong is when the crew that delivered the refurbished unit told my wife that they have to come back many times to replace the units.  True to their observations, I quickly experienced problems with the video input switching function, and was back on the phone with customer support.  I was told to reset the TV by simply disconnecting the power and restarting it.  This quick fix eliminated the problem, but now I am just waiting for it to reappear.Not happy with the performance of the refurbished unit I requested Sony to go into their \"A\" stock (new versus refurbished) to replace my original Bravia.  This request was rejected as I was told that the model has been discontinued - keep this in mind if you are thinking about purchasing this television.I recently walked through Wal-Mart and looked at the new LCD's on display.  Many less expensive sets had as good, if not better, picture then my Bravia.  I am sure that Sony has also improved their LCD televisions, and will be lowering prices to hold their market share against the increasing competition.  They are a good electronics company with superb engineering capabilities, but I think they have considerable room for improvement when addressing a defective product and an unhappy customer.","Date":"August 29, 2006"}

Amazon had the best price for the TV and matching stand.  Shortly after receiving it, it began blacking out.  The tv would stay powered on but the picture would go out randomly for about a minute or 2. I thought maybe my Tivo was dieing since I use that as my primary device.  Within a few weeks the HD DVR from Comcast arrived as well as our IP TV.  The blackouts continued with these units as well. At this point I figure it must be the tv and call Amazon.Not our problem says Amazon you're past the 4 week time frame, call Samsung.  Samsung had a service agent out within a week. Unfortunately he didn't fix it.  There were problems with the service company and it took another 2 weeks for them to get out to try and fix it again.  Nope not fixed after 2 tries.  On both occassion I had to waste my whole day waiting on the repairman.  I was told I will be contacted at 11am on the day of appointment and told when he will be coming.  Both times I was told 3pm (I had requested first stop)My first call to Samsung was on March 21st.  I am still waiting to get this resolved.  I have spent over 5 hours in Customer Service calls with CS and Executive CS.  I keep being told that they will see about getting someone out to fix it or that they will replace the TV.  I never get responses to my follow up emails or phone calls inquiring about when.(I have been polite with an annoyed/frustrated tone at times but never cursed or screamed at anyone - maybe i should start?)I can only say while this TV gets rave reviews, heaven help you if there is a problem with it.  Because Amazon and Samsung sure won't!  They got your money and apparently that is all they care about.  :(  I for one will never buy from either again.","Date":"May 9, 2007"}
{"Title":"After 3 Years- BROKEN","Author":"Amazombie","ReviewID":"R24X22EDZ1MGR7","Overall":"bad","Content":"We purchased this DLP TV for $1200 back in March 2007.We absolutely loved this TV, the only downside possibly is the poor sound quality (easily fixed with surround sound) and also now the price I suppose being that TV prices have dropped so much.However, two weeks ago a pixel-type dot appeared on the screen, white in color. Not actually a pixel of course because DLP is based on tiny mirrors and the image is projected onto the screen from about 12-inches behind the screen. The dot eventually turned black. No big deal, as it was the size of a pinhead admidst a 56-inch screen.However, over the course of the next two weeks more dots appeared, as if the TV contracted chickenpox. There are now over 100 of these dots, some white and flashing and some dead and black, and they are continuing to develop, virtually rendering the television unusable at this point.Of course, after the 1 year expiration there is no warranty back-up from Samsung.I called them and they said a technition would call me to set up an inspection, but this was over a week ago now and I have not received a call. Also, I know it would cost $50-100 just for an inspection, and then to repair the TV I assume will cost me hundreds of dollars. Not worth it.Sad that a $1200 TV has only a 3-yr lifespan.No more DLP for me, and will probably now be conned into purchasing extended warrenties on future TVs.Although disappointed I will make the most out of my new TV-shaped gigantic paperweight.","Date":"January 4, 2011"}

Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it.

They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.Fianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again.Now I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.

{"Title":"Two for Two","Author":"ScottCr","ReviewID":"R2IAHDLCWL6LJI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was told we were buying the latest and greatest technology at the time of our purchase of our first Samsung 61DLP. The picture was great and for the first couple of years all was well. During that time and based on the excellent picture and no problems occuring we purchase a second 61DLP for our downstairs game room. Not long after the second purchase the lamp in the first set went out. I called support and was told the lamp was not covered in the warranty, so we spent $179.00 and installed it ourselves. All went well for another 2 plus years then the set went out again. This time a technician came to the house and informed us that the \"engine\" needed to be replaced. Luckily we had bought the extended 5 year warranty (for $450) and we were still in the warranty period (by 2 months). He replaced the engine with a rebuilt one, can you believe it after spending $450 on a warrantywe got a rebuilt part. But it worked and we were happy again. Only one year later the set went out again and after buying another lamp (which we could not return) we were told by the Samsung technician it wasn't the lamp and the TV for all prctical purposes was dead. My upset is with the fact I spent $4,971.91 for the latest technological set and only got 6 years use out of it, a cost of over $800 per year. But we had the second set and moved it into our living room about 6 months ago. It has seen little use in the game room and had very few hours on it. I thought we would be good for another few years. Nope, today the lamp popped and the tv quit. Is it only the lamp? or is it something else? who knows, we will have to call the Samsung tech people and start all over again. Or we just may scrap the set and go buy a GOOD tv, anyone help us on that one. Two Samsung 61DLP's $7,000 invested and no tv to watch. Never Again!","Date":"March 13, 2011"}

Cost for a fix starts at $400 and goes up if there are any other issues.Your option will be, try a fix that could be a money pit or go LCD TV with a maker other than Samsung.

{"Title":"Very Disappointed with Samsung HL-S6187W","Author":"Lou Verrone \"Lou Dog\"","ReviewID":"R2DSKEWLSPOE8E","Overall":"bad","Content":"Do not buy this set!  And if you do, don't buy without an extended warranty!After months of research and reading hundreds of reviews searching for the best DLP TV back in September, 2006, it was almost no contest that Samsung was getting rave reviews for its picture quality.  Most of my tech head and audio/video buff type friends where all sold on Samsung.  After years of being a life-long owner of Sony's and Toshiba's, I decided to make the move and join the Samsung movement.  1.5 years later, I must say that I regret making the switch and will most likely not purchase another Samsung again.  I will not argue the picture quality is brilliant and a joy to view.  I am not at all displeased with the picture quality.  What I am not happy about is replacing a lamp and ballast for $500 less than 18 months after I purchased it for $2,200.As a lighting professional, I understand that all things like ballasts and lamps can and will fail.  But in my world, ballasts carry a 3 to 5 year warranty and lamps are guaranteed for 50% of their rated life and take a lot more abuse than my TV set.  Considering I have owned only 5 or 6 TV's in 23 years and all, except one are still working and only 1 has ever required repair after 8 years!  I simply don't appreciate paying 25% of the TV's value within 18 months of purchase for needless repairs.  Samsung offered no help other than answering the phone promptly, letting me know I was out of warranty and gave me the telephone number to the local service shop.  As far as I am concerned,  a $2,000 TV should work for a minimum of 3 to 5 years without a penny in repairs.  But the reality is, they don't...so in my case, a bad ballast failed and also caused a lamp failure.  Ballast's should not go bad within 2 years.  I will gladly pay for a new lamp, but Samsung should have furnished a new ballast and they should last at least 5-10 years.Anyway, if you are considering buying a Samsung, beware that there are many service issues that are showing up after the warranty expires that will cost you big bucks, such as noisy and bad color wheels and in my case, ballast and lamps.  My Toshiba display is just as nice, and is still working glitch free. My Sony failed after 8 years, but was so outdated, I was actually praying for it to break so I could buy the Samsung.  My only regret now is not buying another Sony or Toshiba, or minimally, an extended warranty.","Date":"April 18, 2008"}

I called Samsung and was told a Tech would be sent out this week. I explained to Samsung on the phone how the TV was tilted from the base. Samsung said the Tech would try to bring the part, but he may need to come back a second time if he doesn't have the part.The Samsung Tech arrived and after removing the back cover, saw the inside plastic assembly was cracked, said the issue was \"physical damage\" and to contact the seller and left.He said Samsung only covered the electronics, not the internal plastic housing holding the TV upright???  He would NOT give me anything in writing with this determination.I called Samsung again. I spoke to \"Mike #42\" who said I could not have another Tech examine and repair the TV. When I said, so now I just spent $2000 and have a broken TV, he replied, \"Yup, that's pretty much the story\".It is unbelieveable that Samsung would sell a $2000.00 TV which breaks after a day of use and then has techs who try to blame \"shipping\" and also state they don't fix \"the plastic parts\".Clearly there is some sort of design defect with the TV or it is not packaged properly for shipping if the TV's plastic breaks INSIDE after one day of use. Phone representative Mike #42 said to me \"they break if you sneeze on them\" when telling me I'm stuck with a broken TV.I am shocked how Samsung will not stand by their products and honor its warranty. Once the $2000.00 is in Samsung's hands, the customer is treated by Samsung customer service like garbage.","Date":"December 29, 2006"}

It worked for the first day, then wouldn't turn on the next day.

I told the retailer that I wanted a replacement set delivered to my house or the old set picked up and my card credited.  Going into the third week, I've made over 30 documented calls to these two parties and still have a broken TV and no firm plans as to when I'll get a pickup and credit or a new set delivered.  And I've never had my call returned even *once* from Samsung.  Thank goodness this happened within 30 days of purchase or I'd be forced to deal with only Samsung.  The local retailer's performance is unacceptable, but at least they call me back.Beautiful set when it worked, and I'm willing to accept that the set I got was a rare broken one.

{"Title":"Three defective sets!!","Author":"Amazon rocks","ReviewID":"R2GXGGYQ8BQ7Y6","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this set just before Christmas last year.  I got the set on Dec. 28th.  The picture was distorted at the top of the screen in the center.  An area about 12\" wide by about 3\" down.  During movies, you could almost not even see the distortion, but when watching a sporting event with the graphics going across the top of the screen it was very distracting.  I went around and around with Samsung Customer support.  I called three times over about 2 weeks and everytime I called the rep said that he would put it in and that he did not know why it did get put in right the last time.  While I was waiting on the third rep to come through for me and have a local service person call me, a new TV showed up at my door.  I had inquired with Amazon about my options for returning the TV for a new one the same time that I started calling Samsung (Because I would obviously rather have a new set).  I thought that I was waiting on someone from Amazon to call me back about the matter.  But whatever, Amazon is great, I was happy.  HOWEVER, The second set delivered had a obvious power supply problem.  It made a hi pitch noise with the set \"OFF\".  And every other day, the set would not turn on and when it did, the remote would not work.  If you tried to change the channel(or volume, or press any button) on the TV itself when the remote wasnt working, the TV would shut off.  Here we go again. I called Samsung again to find out were I stood with my previous call.  When I got the customer service rep on the phone, he told me that the call had STILL not been put in.  He stated that \"people in here just don't care.\"  I guess he was just trying to relate with me, but this infuriated me.  I made him get a supervisor.  That's where my opinion of Samsung changed.  I got to talk to Stephanie (supervisor).  I told here the situation and she was very professional.  She called the next day to let me know which shop local to me had the service call.  She was great.  I called Omege Electronics, the company that services my area.  They told me that they would not order any parts before they came out to look at the TV.  When I told them that the problem was intermittant, he told me that he would have to bring the set to there shop for a week or so.  Thats when I called Amazon.  They said that I had the option of a refund or wait till March and they would swap it out again.  I chose to have the TV replaced again.  Finally, I got the TV, and, can you believe it, the picture has the same problem as the first TV, only not as bad.  Three strikes, Im out.  But Im sure its just bad luck that I got three bad set in a row.  Good luck if you buy this set, I had none.","Date":"March 6, 2007"}

Adams","ReviewID":"R3LIMIA6B7X57V","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought my first Samsung HLS 5087W on March 6, 2007 from one of the well know \"big box\" Stores.  I chose this model because its picture was far superior to any of the other models in its price range.  I took a chance, however, and bought returned \"open box\" TV, saving a few hundred bucks in the process.  The salesman assured me that the set had been gone over thoroughly before it was put back on sale.When the Television was delivered the picture was stunning, and I was very pleased with my purchase.  After a few days, however, the picture arbitrarily began switching from 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio.  This would happen every half hour to 45 minutes.  Not a big deal but annoying to say the least.  Instead of returning the set under the store's 30 day return policy, I had them send a service technician out to see what could be done.  He scratched his head and said he'd have to do a little research, and would get back to me in a day or so.  About a week later, with no further contact with the technician, the set developed a new problem - it would cut off every once in a while.  At that point, I had had enough of this dog and sent it back to the store.  However, I wasn't ready to give up on Samsung and their bright and beautiful DLP picture.  I paid the extra bucks and had a brand new, right out of the sealed box HLS 5087W delivered.The new TV had been in my house for less than two hours when it lost sound.  I checked all connections and determined that it was a problem in the TV.  An hour or so later I turned the set back on and everything was fine.  I watched it for about an hour thinking all was well when the sound failed again.  I returned to the store that night and told them my sad tale.  The salesperson told me that they had, indeed, had several of these Samsung models returned for various problems.  He said they seemed to be having major quality control problems.  I told him to come get the TV.I took a chance the first time on an open box model and got burned.  I chalked it up to the old adage that \"you get what you pay for.\"  The second time around I took no chances and paid full price for a brand new version of the TV, but still no luck.  Not being a complete fool, my third was not a Samsung.  It's a shame that a TV with such a beautiful picture has to be done in by poor quality control.","Date":"March 31, 2007"}

So if you purchase this device or possibly any other Samsung device you can expect a faulty component to be effected by \"normal wear and tear\".In this case to get it repaired is at a minimum of $450.00.

Last fall, this 50 inch DLP from Samsung sounded like the way to go.  Good reviews, affordable, new color wheel, 1080p (future proof), no risk of burn in, etc.Went ahead and bought it in May.  I was disappointed.  SDTV simply looks god awful on this thing.  Sharpness, color, you name it, it looks way out of whack.  Grainy, dull, ugly.  And let's face it, there's still a lot of SDTV to be watched out there.  Also, rainbowing not totally fixed like product description claimed.  Worst of all, quality control issues at Samsung.  My set (bought at a brick and mortar) had these watermark like stains running along the top and bottom of the screen.  Read a lot about this on other sites, as well as faulty light engines burning out after just several months.Ended up returning and going w/ the new 50 inch plasma from Panasonic.  That set rocks!  SDTV looks far better, not so boxy of a set, only a little higher price tag.  The trade off is 1080p.  The Panny doesn't have it.  But before all you out there start thinking of 1080p as the second coming, I suggest you do a little research into noticeable difference in 1080p, screen size and viewing distance.  Unless you're an avid gamer (I'm not) or like to sit 5 feet from your 50 inch screen, it might not be so special after all.As far at the Samsung again, HDTV looked very good, but not as good as the plasma.  Plasma is just the way to go for HDTV as far as I'm concerned.","Date":"June 25, 2007"}

{"Title":"worst possible amazon experience","Author":"Tim Johnson \"TJ\"","ReviewID":"R2LG37I8FJMXKU","Overall":"bad","Content":"This experience started with excitement about the price. After watching this particular TV for several months, I was pleased to see the price drop to what seemed an excellent deal.I made the purchase innocently enough, though was struck that it may have taken up to three weeks before the product was available. Still, at that price I was willing to wait.After about a week, I received notice that my package was en route and would be here in a few days. On the day that it was to arrive however, I was informed that the package couldn't be transferred from shipper to shipper. Apparently the carrier who would deliver the TV to my door wouldn't accept it due to the fact that there was the sound of broken glass in the box.I contacted Amazon to tell them that I would be willing to wait for a replacement, but I would like to have it expedited. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, and I was informed that my request would have to go to another department. I was told that I would be contacted by the end of the day.Four days later, after not having heard back, I called Amazon. I was informed that the only shipping choice I had available was the specialty shipper, and that there was no possibility of expediting the packaging. It would arrive in 5 to 10 business days.At this point the wait for the television was getting too long, so I asked to cancel the order. I was sent an e-mail two days later stating that all of the e-mails that I had been sending were missed, and they asked if I would like to proceed or cancel. It was at this point when I called in and made it quite clear that I wanted this nightmarish business finished and that they should cancel the order immediately.It's now more than three and a half weeks since my card was charged and several angry conversations later -- I don't have a TV and I don't have a refund. The order details online state that the unit was successfully delivered to a city 70 miles away from me, and there is no sign that I've initiated a return. My credit card retains the original charge, which will start accruing interest soon, but Amazon has assured me that I will be refunded the full amount sometime within the next four (4) weeks.","Date":"September 30, 2006"}

My main interest was in the DRC-MF (Digital Reality Creation Multifunction Circuitry) circuit that upgrades standard 480i signals to 480p or 960i, providing a near-high-definition-quality picture from standard video signals. All three people promised me that my standard definition signal would be \"near HD quality\" and a \"HUGE\" improvement over what my regular SD image looked like. WRONG, WRONG, and WRONG! My SD image on this TV was HORRIBLE! I do not subscribe to HD programming because of the small assortment of channels and the price for most programming is out of my budget for watching television (my TV viewing time is limited). This is not a good TV to watch SD programming. I had my satellite provider come out to check my wiring in the house...no problems there. I employed my Best Buy extended warranty and had a service tech come check out the TV...TV was functioning \"properly\". Needless to say, the TV was not functioning as promised by Sony or Best Buy, so I took it back to the store for a refund.","Date":"January 12, 2007"}

There is nothing you can do to make a non-HD signal look anything like HDTV; garbage in, garbage out. And no, turning your sharpness to 100 doesn't count as HDTV.

He was confused - we got some component cables, hooked it up right, and his jaw was to the floor. There is NO COMPARISON.*If you can't see the difference, see an eye doctor - you may be nearsighted. Before eye-surgery, tv was fuzzy without glasses on.*If you had to settle on ED over HD, telling yourself its \"just as good as HDTV\" is about as reasonable buying a Prius and saying its as fast as any sports car on the road; you bought it to Save Money.

The problem was intermittent at first but now it is almost constant.  The black scenes are blotchy green and other colors are over saturated to the point where the picture becomes a blob of pixels.  The TV screen is so hot that watching it in my bedroom during the summertime was not an option, so it really has been lightly used  (I have two other bigger TVs.)  The response to the remote control is so slow that you often wonder if you hit the right button.  Even if I had purchased an extended warranty, I'd still have to cart the thing more than 60 miles to an authorized Hitachi repair center although I live less than 10 miles from a nice size metropolitan area.  If I had to say anything nice, I'd say that when it works, the picture is great...but it stopped working after less than 500 hours of actual use...and that's a bit more important.","Date":"March 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"Nice tv, BAD service/warranty","Author":"Frustated","ReviewID":"R1E50VEN76U83F","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this Toshiba DLP television recently. Before 1 1/2 months old, it just stopped working. Called Toshiba, and they directed me to 3 service centers. First one never answered the phone. Second one said they would call back within an hour... I called back a couple hours later and they said they were swamped and would call me back. Never heard from them again. Third one said Toshiba did not authorize them for home service. So now I'm stuck with a $1500 paperweight, until they will authorize the retailer I bought it from to service it.So after talking with the tech at the retailer, he was sure it was the lamp. It took me 2 hours to get toshiba to send me a lamp replacement(they kept on flat out refusing until they called the tech themselves), which ended up not even fixing it.Now, it could be weeks before I get a working television(guaranteed another week at the very earliest), it's already been a week. I am just in shock that I spend that kind of money on something, it breaks this soon, and they could care less if or how long I am without a television. They will not budge on trying to compromise to make me even somewhat satisfied. It's just 'sorry, company policy' over and over and over.I have always owned toshiba tv's, but never had a problem with one. Their level of customer service just plain stinks. I truely can't believe it, I've dealt with microsoft for xbox 360 problems, and I thought that was bad. I've dealt with Nintendo, there's a company that knows customer service. This is just plain frustration and nothing else. With a tv that new, they should be letting me take it back to the retailer for a new set. If it wasn't for a 30% restocking fee the tv would be returned now.Bottom line, if you have any problems with a toshiba product be prepared to be without it for a long time and get no satisfaction at all. And now I will worry that my tv is a 'lemon' and even after I get through this mess it will just happen again in a couple months to go through again??","Date":"January 9, 2007"}

Simons","ReviewID":"R2UKX9GVANVJUS","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought one of these exactly 2 months ago and it got a splendid picture and functioned perfectly...till about an hour ago. I was watching it and heard a loud pop and that was it. I looked in the trouble shooting section of my manual and confirmed the lamp was indeed burned out.So I went online so see about getting a bulb from one of the 2 sites listed in the manual only to find the first site had been sold to a domain selling site, and the second site had no bulbs whatsoever. After searching the web I found out these lamps sell for $600, if you can accually find one. Sorry, but I'm not foolish enough to pay $600 every 2 months (Or less than 2 months according the the other review) to keep it running. Nor do I want to hear the \"Sorry, but I can't help you because of company policy\" line or wait weeks for the service department to do thier job.I am returning it tomorrow. Lucky for me I was doing a rent-to-own contract on this new TV so I only lost my first payment. So I would recommend people not buy this type of TV. Since all DLP TVs work with these lamps, I would think of them as a brilliant $600 light bulb that only lasts about as long as your average light bulb with a $1500 recepticle that will sit dark in the corner waiting for you to feed it another lamp.","Date":"January 31, 2007"}

Immediately, I got the black bar across the top of the screen and they replaced the light engine.  It is on the 4th bulb, as of yesterday.  Each bulb lasts about 2,000 hours and not the 8,000 hours that is promised.  My repairman said to be cautious of using generic $100 bulbs from Ebay, because they will ruin the ballast and cause a more expensive repair.  The next replacement will be out of my pocket, so I will probably shell out close to $200 for an authentic Toshiba bulb and replace myself (very easy to do).  Hopefully, I've sold this POS before then.  I'm thinking about putting a money jar by the TV asking guests for bulb contributions.

Picture is awesome, internal speakers are decent.At the beginning of 2009 the fan started to make loud noises. A tech came out and diagnosed the fan as bad. While waiting for a replacement fan to show up, the bulb got too hot and blew up. The fan and bulb were replaced.About a month after the bulb and fan were replaced, there was no picture again. They sent me a new bulb, thinking that was the problem. But the TV still had no picture. A technician came out and diagnosed the whole light engine as bad. They took the light engine to be repaired since there weren't parts for this TV anymore. A couple of weeks after that, they called me and told me that they couldn't fix the light engine and would be giving me a replacement TV. I replaced this unit with a Panasonic.All-in-all... If I did it over again, I would not buy this television and I would have spent a little more on something with a proven track record.","Date":"May 5, 2009"}

I think I paid $799 for it just 15 months ago and the lamp has to be replaced. Until this point I was happy with Toshiba products(I have a 42\" LCD and two HD-DVD players) but now...How can you justify a TV that costs $1000 retail having to have a $200 part every year? Of course the warranty expired 3 months ago. An extended warranty may have covered the new bulb but you have to make sure, for $50 bucks or so the 2 year warranty would cover 2 bulbs at this rate and save about $400.","Date":"June 16, 2008"}

{"Title":"Unacceptable reliability","Author":"A. T. Williams","ReviewID":"RCDI58LHFRV4Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought our TV mid 2007 and was initially pleased with the apparent value.  The picture quality was great, though the speakers were underpowered when watching digital television signals.  Analog channels had acceptable volume.My frustration began in late 2009.  The TV began making a buzzing or grinding sound intermitently; some days were worse than others.  Shortly thereafter, the picture went out and the TV was inoperable.  Several online reviews described the same noise and diagnosed it as the light engine, not the bulb, color wheel, or fan.  Light engines were available online for approximately $400, but I was neither confident in the diagnosis nor the installation.I called a repair man to confirm the problem before proceeding.  He determined that the color wheel was no longer properly aligned, which was the likely source of the noise.  He was surprised that the color wheel caused the picture to go bad, and discovered that the bulb was burnt out.On most DLP sets, the total cost of these 2 repairs would be approximately $350.  Unfortunately, Toshiba is one of the few DLP manufacturers that does not sell individual parts like the color wheel, choosing instead to sell the light engine assembly.  Non-OEM parts were available online as mentioned earlier, but this was only one of the 2 problems.  To replace the bulb and light engine, I was looking at $600 which can buy a completely new TV.Online reviews accurately described the symptoms and problem, and estimated the cost of repair well.  However, had I pursued the repair myself I would have missed the 2nd unrelated problem caused by the burnt out bulb.  In this case, calling a qualified repair technician paid off.Toshiba's decision to sell spare parts at the modular level makes the most likely repairs major investments.  According to the repair man, Toshiba is the exception and not the rule for DLP TV's.  Since I had paid the repair man for the visit, I interviewed him about him long-term TV reliability.  He had a couple of interesting points:1) DLP TV's are on the lower end of repair costs (excluding Toshiba due to their modular assembly).  LCD's and plasma's are also modular and are expensive to repair.2) He warned of the lowest tier of TV's due to the frequency of the parent company filing bankrupcy.  He suggested that you stick to Philips, Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, etc.","Date":"March 2, 2010"}

I didn't purchase the PSP, so thats the way it goes, but for HP to make the consumer have to replace their TV in a year is unacceptable business practice.FYI...Sony, Panasonic, et al provide replacement parts much more readily.Do yourself a favor and take into account how easy it will be to get service on your TV if you need it.Having said all of that, I'm particularly disappointed because I thought this unit was excellent...while it actually worked.","Date":"January 31, 2008"}

{"Title":"Burned Out after two years","Author":"Aaron","ReviewID":"R2LUFK1DOMDCMD","Overall":"bad","Content":"Like some of the other reviewers, I had this TV for about two years and then it just burned out. No picture.  The price may look cheap, but if you have to replace your TV every two years, it's really quite expensive.  Also, because HP is not a common brand, you can't program universal remotes from cable/satelitte providers to work with it.  So, you will always need two remotes.  The speakers/sound of the TV are wildly inadequate.  Also, this TV has serious burn problems.  The parts of the picture on the sides of the screen were signficantly brighter after moderate use.  This was due to viewing some non-widescreen broadcasts, which apparently dimmed the more-used pixels significantly.  I WISH I HAD BOUGHT A SONY/SHARP/SAMSUNG/PIONEER.","Date":"March 30, 2010"}

Do a google search for problems related to this model and you will find numerous hits. For me personally, this TV self-destructed after only a couple of years.  It was on, there was a loud pop, and now it no longer works. I disected it myself to see if it wasn't maybe something simple, like a blown fuse or capacitor, but a fter searching around it seems this is a very common problem.  Replacement parts are somewhat hard to find...but the cost for those parts is around $300-$500.  Having someone actually service it will run you $600-$900, but there are numerous reports of people being unable or unwilling to service this particular TV.Before it died, we experiended many of the problems with pixel flare/MAL discharge issue and the image shuttering when showing images with a lot of white or bright colors.  Again, extremely common problem although there are reports of being able to adjust voltage settings on the PSU and resolve some of them.  If you're comfortable poking around in the guts of your TV, it might not be an issue for you.There's no reason to buy this TV.  It has a history of problems and there are any number of TVs that are as good, if not better, better brands, better features, for less money.","Date":"June 19, 2010"}

We went to Circuit City and decided on the LG 37\"...it was the least expensive and seemed to have the best picture.Dad didn't want to pay for an expensive CC extended warranty because we figured if something were to go wrong with the set, it would happen within a year.We got the set home and installed...the picture was so good with just the coaxial cable connection that Dad canceled the appointment I had made with Comcast to set him up with a hi-def digital box.Well, everything went fine until July 2007...two months after the LG warranty expired, the TV suddenly stopped responding to the remotes...not just the LG remote, but another universal remote that he had programmed as well. He eliminated all of the obvious causes...dead batteries, blocked sensors,light interference etc. He had the TV taken into be repaired. The tech, after undoing almost 100 screws to get to the circuit board, said he found and repaired a badly soldered wire (which surprised me since I figured that these circuit boards are all solid)..that was the only thing he could figure was wrong with it. The TV/remotes worked fine for about 3 weeks and now the same thing has happened again. So my 89 yr old father has to get up and go over to the TV every time he wants to adjust the volume of change channels. I call it the LG Senior Citizen Workout.Of course the set is beyond warranty, so neither LG nor CC has any legal responsibility...except that people should know that there are serious manufacturing flaws in these products that are not easy repairable...even if the consumer is willing to pay for the repair.LFNYC","Date":"September 16, 2007"}

But I have been hearing really good things about Samsung's line of TV and the contrast ratio of 3000:1 on this TV made me pull the trigger.I am just very disappointed because the complaint about the \"Not supported mode\" is very true.  It appears that this TV doesn't like to support progressive scan from a progressive scan DVD player.  It does fine with HDTV signals which are currently at 720p or 1080i but half of my use of this TV is to watch DVDs on a progressive scan dvd player.  Yes, I can still watch DVDs by disabling the progressive mode of the DVD and watching it in 480i.  But that's like going backwards 5 years.And the thing about Xbox 360 makes perfect sense.  If you are playing games on it, you are most likely in HD mode so it works, but if you are trying to watch a DVD, then you are in progressive scan mode (480p) so it doesn't work.  I am just deeply disappointed in Samsung that they failed me like this on my very first Samsung purchase.  This is a basic mode that they overlooked.  Who knows what might go wrong next?  This TV is going back to the store.The TV itself is very nice actually.  Nice sleek look, great picture from HD signals, but it still left a really bad taste in my mouth that Samsung couldn't get one of the most basic things right.An update.  If I could rate Samsung's Tech support, I would give it 0 stars.  I called them up on this issue and was hung up on twice while in the process of going to higher level of support (which I am beginning to guess is their way of hanging up on people).","Date":"December 29, 2006"}

On Feb 13, took it to the repair shop for warranty repair.  Was told after 5 days, that the part that it needed was no longer available.  And that they would send me a  replacement TV.  The TV was a 2005 model, manufactured in 3/2006.  Was asked to fax my receipt.  Samsung gets my receipt and says that it is to blurred to read.  Have spent hours on hold trying to get to their customer support about the TV.  I feel that since I have called several times to try to get some answers that Samsung is recognizing my name or case number  and just ignoring my being on hold.  Yesterday was on hold for an hour and a half with music playing in my ear.  Monday, I will fax them an 8X10 copy of my receipt that I hope will not be too blurred to read.  So things are still up in the air.  Was getting the TV for a bedroom, and had plans to buy a 40 inch soon.  No way, will I buy it from a Samsung dealer.  With all this calling and waiting, my 30 day return policy has passed and I stuck having to make payments on it. I had the TV for about 10 days, and even though it was my first LCD type TV , had to learn about it.  I could not turn it on or off, except with the remote.  Neither did the controls on the side work.  So I can not give any opinion about picture quality or anything..........just want them to send my replacement TV.  So beware of needing any repair while in warranty.  And if your TV is not working as it should, take it back and do it quickly, and forget about having any warranty work done.

I bought a refurbished model and Philips gives you only 90 days of warranty of refurbished products.

I bought this item from a local retailer in Dallas because it seemed to have the best picture for the size and price.  I also tried to find reviews online before I made the purchase and was only able to find the customer reviews here on Amazon.  It was delivered today and I spent most of the day trying to adjust the picture quality. The great picture I saw in the store was impossible to duplicate at home.I do not have an HD signal to feed into it yet as I was waiting to upgrade my DishNetwork DVR until after the TV was delivered.  However, the standard def picture is awful.  Whatever settings I tried, the picture was dull and hazy.  Everything about the picture was lifeless compared to my old 42\" EDTV Samsung... except for the color green.  The green will burn your retinas!  Grass and trees looked like they were painted neon green. Adjusting the hue to a more red shade failed to counteract the over-powering green and only caused skin colors to look horrribly sunburned.I also failed to get a sharp picture.  I wouldn't say that the picture was blurry. But adjusting the contrast and brightness settings either returned a picture that looked like it had a transparent white film over everything or a picture that was to shadowy and overly black.  Finding a happy-medium was impossible.The original factory setting are completely unsatisfactory.  Someone in the Hitachi labs is colorblind and has cataracts.

Unfortunately, if you have one, yours will likely quit in the same way mine did after 2.5 years: You'll lose picture, but still have sound. My local repairman told me that, even if he could get the parts (they are simply unavailable from any supplier), the cost would be greater than the cost of a new name-brand TV. (He based that statement on his knowledge of the prices of similar parts for other brands he services.) Also, based on troubleshooting info I found online, I took it apart to see if there might be any bad capacitors, but they all looked good (that is, not bulging or leaking like electrolytics do when they fail). I treated my TV really well, never overheated it, and always powered it through a surge suppressor, and it still died. Serves me right for picking a TV based on its picture quality.

When I pop in a DVD, the sound drops. I have to turn it high, and sometimes it's still not enough.I am disappointed that it died just after, actually within, three years. Very disappointed.It started by just flickering between all 5 inputs on its own, as if a phantom took hold of my remote and kept hitting the input button. Then one day, it just didn't turn on, and that's where I am now.I called Polaroid, and with no extended warranty, they offered to give me a refurbished unit for $175, and I'd have to ship my old unit back on my dime. Dissatisfied. A TV repair place knows exactly what the problem is, and quote at least $20 to fix.I was very happy with it until it died. I am careful with electronic devices. All items that came with the unit are perfectly in tact, including the box, and packaging.I hope that they no longer sell this model. Very disappointed.

Due to an extensive remodeling project, the TV was just plugged in and the receiver does not work!  Direct TV will take zero responsibility for this!  Their excuse is that the TV is made by HUMAX and that the receiver isn't made by them either.  My response to them is that their name shoudn't be plastered across the box then!  HUMAX also takes zero responsibility (it has a one year warranty - after one year, you can forget getting anything from them) as this unit is no longer made nor sold in retail stores!  Thank goodness, I was not a cheapskate and bought an extended 4 year warranty - the best $99.00 I ever spent!  This was an expensive unit and to not have the TV work because the receiver doesn't work is pretty frustrating (you CAN attach a different receiver to it and it should work, but that pretty much defeats the purpose and makes for an expensive 20\" LCD TV!)  Installing an integrated receiver obviously wasn't such a hot idea.  I'm not yet sure how Best Buy will handle this, but it is under warranty, so they will need to deal with it somehow.  I guess I would rather buy a different flat screen TV and simply attach a Direct TV receiver to it, so that if one goes down, they don't both go down.  I would think twice before you buy this unit.  It is a nice looking, compact unit, but it's not worth it if something goes wrong. It seems that satelite receivers have a tendency to \"die\" way more often than they should.

The \"service\" number in the Akai manual connects you with seems not to be tech-support at all, but an answering service  in Ohio. (The corporate HQ is in California!) The \"associate\" who answers the phone tells you that, \"...they will pass your problem along.\" They also tell you not to expect any action for over a month because they have to do \"research\" on finding someone in your area to fix your TV. A month or more to look up \"TV repair\" in the phone book. Right!When you ask for a name of somebody who is empowered to make decisions at the company, you get the dodge, \"We're just an answering service.\" No phone numbers. No last names. They evidently got off the dime when, on the third phone call, I threatened legal action, after a month of being ignored. But I still can't talk to anyone at Akai to find out the problem or who's in charge. Zero, zero, zero in the feedback dept. Customer service at Akai borders on criminal negligence. Nobody is home.Six weeks after my first call, a local repair person called me and showed up a week later. Akai really must have done that \"research\", because he reflects their corporate culture--he doesn't return my phone calls. I suspect they just picked the cheapest service and now are dragging their feet on providing the part. But I don't know. He hasn't gotten back to me for over a week. But at least with him I can personally go to his physical location to find out what's going on.If you think you can solve this problem by getting an independent warranty, think again.

The rest of it is abolutely 0 stars.First off the set broke in early February. It started shutting itself down due to a false lamp temperature problem immediately after booting up. Ok that happens, things break. This is where the nightmare begins.2 weeks after I report it to Mitsubishi to get it serviced, an authorized agent shows up without any tools or parts, not a good sign. Then I am told by said service tech. that I needed a new light engine and lamp and that I would have to fax them a copy of my proof of purchase so they could order the parts. About a week later after not hearing anything I called the servicer who told me the parts should have been in. I called Mits. to find out what the deal was and was told the parts were backordered. I waited 5 days to see when the parts would be in and was told they did not get a part number from the servicer. I asked if they had no part number how could they tell me they were backordered.Good ?. So a month and a half of hassle later, the service center comes out again...and hour and a half late mind you, again no tools, no parts and looks at the TV again and tells me it needs a light engine and a lamp..no kidding. That was Friday the 6th of April, 2 months after it broke. So I called Mits today , Monday the 9th of April and have spoken to 3 more unknowledgable customer-non-service reps from Bangledesh or wherever, and was told I needed to fax a copy of my proof of purchase just before she rattled off where I bought it(Electronics Expo) when I bought it and the model number. I told them I already did all this a month and a half ago, you know what I need, please get my warrantied TV fixed, its been 2 months. I have now sat on hold as I type for over an hour. So like I said , great TV when it works, but if it breaks, hold on to your hat because you'll be in for a long frustrating ride.Update , Aug 22 2007.  Just a note that I upgraded to 3 stars because as I said now that it works again, it is an amazing picture. I did take me 2 months to get it fixed, alot of frustration  and ribbing from the boys at work, but we made it through. If it breaks stay on them, I think it was a common failure in the light engine, hopefully Mits. worked it out. It is great while it works.","Date":"April 9, 2007"}

Each time the tv is \"out\" for repairs, it has been in a repair shop for at least 3 months.  Maintenance has only taken it out of action for 2-3 weeks waiting for the lamps.  I view maintenance and repair as two seperate items.The first problem that occurred was the blinking red light and no picture.  This was due to a burned out light engine, per the repair store.  If the warranty had not covered it in the first 180 days, it would have been an $1800 dollar repair, plus labor.The second issue is with the replacement and dispossal of the $230 lamps that contain mercury.  You can't just toss these things into the trash.  In the 3 years of ownership, I've gone through four lamps, each costing at least $230, at a cost of roughly a thousand dollars. In 3 situations I had to go through the internet to purchase new lamps.  Shipping at first from Mitsubishi took 3 weeks.This last problem that I am in the middle of now is the dreaded blinking green light on the front.  Per several investigative websites(Consumer Affairs, etc.), blinking green light is caused by two different types of situations.  The first situation is that one of the two cpu's on the device is not in synchronization with the other cpu.  Ergo no fix, just replace the item.  The other situation is with the 4 capacitors on the mainboard, either the 4 caps will need to be replaced by new capacitors, and/or the mainboard will need to be replaced.Minimum cost of repair for the last problem has been estimated at least at $1000 plus labor.  The problem is that any solution starts with recognizing a design flaw during manufacturing.  The tv sets were assembled with inadequate parts, per some investigatory websites.  The parts themselves do not function adequately in the environment created by the rest of the parts inside the tv.  The capacitors alone were not meant to handle the electrical load of the mainboard.There is one positive, the glare is not as much of a problem with this model.","Date":"March 15, 2009"}

A few months ago I noticed a little white dot on the screen for someone with a little case of OCD it drives you nuts, BUT... Now a couple months later there is 23 white dots and about 30 black dots so it can bug me whether I am watching a light screens or a dark one! Yippee!

{"Title":"Our Mitsubishi Nightmare","Author":"edmlfc \"Lesson Learned\"","ReviewID":"RZJRQWLKJ0KG2","Overall":"bad","Content":"It all started when we purchased this TV. We went to the store and yes it looked great! Wonderful picture! Little did we know the store has a \"\"limited\"\" amount of channels. Mostly HD. We get the TV home, the picture is horrible. Of course we call the cable company, they come out and we upgrade to digital cable. One week later we upgrade again to HD. Finally a picture that looks good but I only watch that one channel once a week. All of the other channels still look horrible. We call the store where we bought it. Now it seems we need monster cables. We purchase those for over $200 dollars. Picture still no good. We call the cable company again they come back out change the cables in the house. Still not a good picture. We call the store, they say it's our reception we should get satellite. We call cable company they come back out, change the box outside the house. Still a bad picture. We cancel the cable. We call satelite. They come out hook up our dish. Once again HD channels are great but don't watch but one, once a week. We call the store, they come out. NOW.... it's the satellite getting a bad reception, not the TV. Even though we are getting a signal of 97%. We call the satelite company they come back out adjust the satelite. I hold them hostage for some answers!!! By now it's been almost 3 months dealing with the same problem \" a bad picture\"!! They tell me I would need the satelite to recieve the HD channels, a pair of rabbit ears to recieve my local channels and an outside antenna to recieve other analog channels \"that I do watch\" to get a good decent picture. The store's tech came out the day after the satellite company came out and told me the same thing. so I did some research through BestBuy found out he's right. On the Best Buy website I quote: \"NO MATTER HOW NICE A TV YOU BUY, THERE ISN'T MUCH YOU CAN DO TO MAKE REGULAR TV, INCLUDING DIGITAL CABLE OR SATELLITE, LOOK BETTER. My only question is: WHY DIDN'T THE SALES PERSON TELL US THIS???? The other TV we were looking at was smaller but more $$$$. Now we are stuck with a Tv we cannot watch for more than 1 1/2 -2 hours.  The picture is so BLURRY you really can't stand it for much longer than that. A good example: During Super Bowl Sunday: we were trying to watch the game, you could not tell if the score was an 8,3 or 9. It just all blurred together. I do not recommend buying this TV unless you never watch REGULAR TV. This Tv is only good for DVD's or HD channels. The best part of our \"LEARNING EXPERIENCE' the store will not take it back because now it has been over 30 days.","Date":"March 8, 2007"}

The TV indicated it needed a new lamp, so I replaced it. For five minutes I had a picture that was crisp and perfect. Then it developed a red tinted bar across the top of the screen. Researching of the web determined it was a manufacturer flaw and is very expensive to fix. I called Sony, which admitted the flaw, admitted it was extending the warranty on some projection LCDs, but this particular model was not included. So I asked for Sony to honor its no cost electronics take back program and schedule a pick up to recycle it. I was given a bogus web site and two bogus phone numbers. Sony in fact does not have such a program, unless you want to drive 90 miles to the nearest recycling depot to drop it off.I will never purchase another Sony product again.","Date":"December 2, 2012"}

{"Title":"High Maintenance Costs","Author":"Donavon","ReviewID":"R2214A0YOB25W6","Overall":"bad","Content":"The main thing you want to consider before buying this TV is the replacement of the lamp.  I bought mine in Nov 2006, replaced the bulb in Oct 2008 $200, replaced it again 8 months later in June 2009 $150, again 7 months later in Jan 2010 $150 and today 10 months later it has gone out again which will be another $150.  And to top it off, this lamp is on back order so Ill have to hunt around for 3rd party places.$650 in bulb replacement costs over 4 years.  Most of us plan to keep our TV's for 10-15 years especially since we all paid so much for them.  First bulb has the 2 year life, after that 6-10 months life on replacements.  Pay that every year for 10 years and your looking at $1500.  Hidden costs if you ask me.In addition my friend bought the same TV except it was the 50inch the same day I bought mine.  He has replaced his bulbs in the same timeframes as I.Don't get me wrong, the TV quality was fantastic so long as your lamp is bright.  If the bulb wasn't so short lived and a high cost, I would give this 5 Star's however I must give it 1 star because its unrealistic to have bulbs go out this much.  You basically pay for the cost of the TV and through the life that you keep this TV you will eventually spend the money on bulb replacements that eventually will add up to the cost of another TV.  So if you keep this for 10 years, you will be paying for two TV's but only have one TV.I will not buy another bulb again.  I will be looking at buying another TV that's not Sony.","Date":"November 24, 2010"}

{"Title":"Nice TV for a while...","Author":"MB 007","ReviewID":"RRVA8C1GJKP3I","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this television in early 2006 when I moved into my new home.  I needed to get rid of my tube HDTV due to space constraints, and I needed a panel to mount above the fire place.I spent a very large amount of time doing homework on the specifications, and narrowed my search based on price and my requirements (1080p, LCD, etc), and arrived at either the Sony XBR or the Samsung LNS4695d.  After hitting the pavement, and seeting the set in the proper viewing places (avoide Best Buy and other big box stores, as they split the signal too many times, and have varying signals between different sets depending on where they sit on the daisy chain) and decided the Samsung offered virtually the same picture quality and specifications as the Sony, and for less money.The set treated me great for 3 years, with only one exception.  During very fast motion, such as a football game (American) where the ball was thrown past the crowd, or a car race, I would experience macro-blocking, and the set's 60hz simply could not keep up with very fast moving HD broadcasts (via cable).  There were other issues related to this, but suffice it to say, the TV processed too slow to keep up, and artifacts and other symptoms showed that.  I also had minor ghosting in some circumstances, but I find that is visible to the experienced eye even on the Sony sets and other CFL backlit models.After 3.5 years, just out of warranty, the set recently started showing horizontal white and colored lines.  flashing and intermittant at first, over 8 weeks, they slowly became more static, and eventually made the TV unwatchable.  The condition appeared across all sources, and after much troubleshooting and time on the phone with Samsung, the TV was determined by them as \"at the end of its useful life.\"  For the price I paid, I found this conclusion utterly unaccetpable.  After further research, I've determined the board that processes the horizontal information had failed.  The part is $500 from Samsung and a handful of other providors, which equates to what I could purchase the same television for now on ebay.  There are essentially zero Samsung service centers, and no in-home service options.  I would have been forced to ship the television out of state for analysis and service, with no guarantee it could be repaird.  I decided not to bother attempting to repair it, as purchasing another working set would have been the same or cheaper than other options.I've since upgraded to another brand, with more current features, and have been very pleased.While the failed hardware isn't a widespread issue (though it does exist if you look closely online), i simply couldn't reccomend this product to anyone any longer, primarily because of Samsung's determination that a $x,xxx television set should only last 3 years.  The other issues were annoying, but I was able to live with them, however the set I use now is flawless, and cheaper, and more advanced.  My advice, continue to avoid paying for the Sony brand, and Samsung is not the solution.  With some homework, you can do much much better for the money.","Date":"October 23, 2009"}

I went into the store and got a full credit. Unfortunately I had only found that 1080p displays have INCREASED in price and not decreased! That's a first!The Sharp Aquos easily looked the worst out of the three I checked out. At the time the Sony 46\" Bravia was four hundred dollars more than the Samsung, so I said forget it! People say you pay more just for the \"Sony\" logo on the TV. I don't agree. I do think you get more than the competition.I went with this display and hooked it up. I put in a movie and was shocked to see what I found. Certain scenes would go black and some pixelated \"shadow\" or images would still be on the screen. Kind of like \"leftovers\" of the previous image. It looked so horrible. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. It's hard to describe this really.The only way to fix this problem was by using \"Game Mode\" to speed up the display. Nice! Not quite, because this setting does NOT allow you to use the preset settings for the TV (such as Normal, Movie)! It ONLY allows you to use \"Custom\" settings.I configured this TV to my liking and used Digital Video Essentials for calibration. I have experience with calibrating my TVs just perfectly. I've found that the DNIe setting on this TV just makes everything look worse! It's almost as if it just cranks up the sharpness setting to max.I connected up my Oppo Digital Upscaling DVD player and played dozens of movies with this DVD player and a Toshiba HD-DVD player. Certain parts of movies have extremely annoying greenish speckles or tint. This is mostly displayed in very dark scenes. It's so easy to spot this and there is absolutely no setting to fix this. Perhaps a special service menu can fix this. I shouldn't have to do that!I also tried several new cables and various DVD players. I also tested a DVD player through the Component Inputs and was shocked at how terrible the picture was. It was as if input was bad or something. Sure, 1080p can make lower quality video look bad, but not THAT bad. This was unacceptable picture quality for such a high priced TV!I was also watching \"ICE AGE\". On the white ice you can see very faint lines in the image. This occurs in very bright scenes throughtout movies. It's almost not noticable in dark scenes though or from more than 5 feet away. This alone though is so bad that it's enough to make me want to return it.Again, i've wasted hours upon hours to try to see what caused the greenish tint. Even standard television stations sometimes have this. It mostly appears in shadows and especially on the left hand side of the screen.Now today while watching \"The Green Mile\" I saw ghosting! Yes, even with \"Game Mode\" on! I couldn't believe it!The TV is well designed and nice to look at. Other than the green tint to  parts of the movie and the white lines, HD-DVD picture quality is incredible! I was really impressed with the picture quality. Sames goes for very well made standard DVDs such as \"The Green Mile\".I think the remote is good. It's well laid out and i've had no problems with it. The menu system is a bit slow though.I had high expectations for this. I did hours and hours of research and could find no bad things about this display at all! Perhaps I just got a bad one, who knows. I went back to the store and we are doing an exchange for the Sony 46\" Bravia 1080p display. Hopefully I will have better luck with that!It hurts to give this nice thing a 2/5 score. It honestly would be unfair to give it a higher score for such great HD-DVD picture quality with all of it's problems. There's just so many of them. For the price you pay for this television it needs to be perfect! Some could say no TV is perfect, but that's not true!Now I think I know why the Sony Bravia is a few hundred dollars more! I should have trusted my gut when in the store instead of saving a little money.12-14-2006 UPDATE:I'm still using this TV. I went to do an exchange 14 days after purchasing this. It was that bad. I have to wait until the 21st for my new Television. It's nice that people love this TV and you got a good one. I wish I did. I don't know if mine is just defective or what.I now have absolutely TERRIBLE ghosting. It's so bad it makes my head hurt. There is no way this could have a 8ms refresh rate! I watch maybe a dozen movies a week and it's just so bad. At some points It was making me so mad that I just wanted to turn off the movie! I do have \"Game Mode\" on and have tried every setting. I've experienced this with The Green Mile, Mad Max: Beyong Thunderdome, Art School Confidential and half a dozen other movies. I've tried several DVD players as well. Strangely this doesn't occur quite as much with Blu-Ray and HD-DVD movies. The faint white lines are also annoying as well. You can see them from a mile away.12-21-2006 UPDATE:I finally had them come pick up my TV and replace it with a Sony. The Sony KDL-46XB2 has been out of stock at my local store for over a month, but I finally received it. I love the Sony and it's great so far. Nearly everything is good in my book, but i've only used it for a day. I'm going to evaluate it for 2 weeks or more and then post a review of it. The only problem is that some units have a \"cloud\" defect, so it might be a risk. Luckily mine is ok. I could have \"gotten by\" with Samsung, but it had way too many issues. The Sony was only two hundred more and was well worth it.  The \"guts\" are not the same. Only the panel from what I've read.","Date":"December 1, 2006"}

The problem is they often have discolored areas where the tint varies across the screen.  Mine had a green center haze, and pinkish outer haze from day one.  As it aged it also developed a purplish blue glow in blacks.  I called for service.  The service company said it needed a new optical block, and agreed it looks bad.  They showed up to fix it with part in hand a full 6 weeks after I first called for repair.  The guy fumbled around for 2.5 hours.  He had never taken this model apart before and had no service manual!  I had to look on the internet for instructions on taking it apart.  After all this, we turned it on and it's three times worse than before. The repair guy said it looks really bad.  Now black is totally glowing royal blue, and the green and pink haze on light colors is even worse.  I called Sony again and they told me to call the service company. The service company told me it's not really defective, it just has 'picture quality issues'!  They said they probably have to order another optical block, and go through all this again.  Then if that fails, Sony might finally give me a new tv.  This is a real joke!  I would avoid these sets until when, and if Sony perfects them better.","Date":"April 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"Broken Promises From The Get-Go","Author":"Shaun P. Sullivan \"Sulli\"","ReviewID":"R2KDJC2502E9T6","Overall":"bad","Content":"I ordered this product on 06Dec06, which is plenty of time to get it by Christmas using Amazon's super saver shipping.  I chose to pay extra to upgrade to the only available option of \"standard shipping\".On 07Dec06 I received an email stating that my TV had shipped and giving me the tracking number.  I initially noticed that the tracking number had information from a 2004 shipment on it.  Knowing that tracking numbers are reused I expected it to clear out and be updated.  After several days, I contacted Amazon and found out that I was not even given the correct tracking number to begin with and was given the correct tracking number.The TV was coming from Reno, NV and going to Phoenix, AZ (which is a 1 day trip), but was estimated at a 5 day delivery.  The package arrived in Phoenix the morning of 14Dec06.  Friday afternoon when I had gotten no calls from the delivery company, I decided to call them.  I was initially told that the delivery would be next Tuesday (19Dec06) at the earliest.  After complaining for some time I was told that I could have it delivered Saturday 16Dec06.  I was also informed that there was a notation that the box had a \"tear\" in it from the shipper.On Saturday when the TV was delivered, I had them open up the box in my presence.  Exactly where this tear was (a 1\" by 6\" hole) was damage from an impact (most likely a forklift).  The hit was so hard that the whole top of the TV was destroyed.  I of course refused the shipment and called Amazon.The first gentleman that I spoke with told me that he could not help me and that I needed to talk with the \"electronics department\", but that he could not transfer me.  Instead, he would have to send an email to them and they should be getting back with me in 2 days.  On Sunday 18Dec06, I received an email saying that they could send out a replacement, but couldn't guarantee delivery by Christmas or I could have a refund that wouldn't come for 2-3 \"business\" days.I called again and was told that no Supervisors or Team Leads were available and that one would call me back within 2 hours.  2 hours came and went with no call, so I called again.  This time I was told that there was no Supervisors or Team Leads even working today.  When I confronted the Rep on the fact that SOMEONE had to be watching over her, she was magically able to find a Team Lead for me to speak with.  He told me that he could not send out a replacement nor refund my money.  He said that they only thing he could do was send an email to his Supervisor, who \"should\" get back with me by the end of business.About an hour later, I received a phone call from someone at Amazon who was not the Supervisor who was supposed to be calling me back.  He in fact confirmed this and said that he was only a Team Lead.  He told me that he was told that the only thing that they could do for me was to refund my money, because they could not guarantee shipping by Christmas.  When I asked when they sent out a broken TV to begin with, why they could not pay to send the TV 2nd day; I was told that FedEx or UPS would not accept a package that big for shipment.  Now I have a FedEx account and to ship that TV from Reno 2nd day cost $310 and to ship it 1 day was $325.  I then asked to be refunded my money PLUS the cost to buy it locally, since they knowingly sent out a broken TV.  I was told that all he could do is refund my money and that I should get it within 2-3 business days.  Then he hung up!Therefore, the answer to the problem is to NEVER use Amazon again for anything that is time sensitive or over a couple hundred bucks.  Even my order that really was not needed quickly said \"In Stock\" on the site, but magically was back ordered, when they got their money, for a week that ended up being a month.  Amazon like many companies before it has gotten too big for its britches.  Even right now, I can take back products for 90 day with no exclusions and no questions at Wal-Mart._______________________Updated information:After my initial review of Amazon and this joke of an order, I spent the next 1 1/2 weeks talking to many more CS Reps, Team Leads, and even a few \"Supervisors\".  Every time I was told a completely different story and was told that, it did not matter that there was notations in the system otherwise.  When I told them that I had been recording every conversation that I had had with Amazon I was told that it did not matter.Trying to call the corporate office was a joke too.  The secretary who answered asked how she could help you and when you ask for the CEO, she says she CANNOT do anything without a name.  Knowing his name, I asked for him and was told that he does not take calls.  I then asked for his secretary and was again asked for a name.  In the end what ended up being my TRUE options was to wait 2-4 weeks for Amazon to process a return(how you return something that was never technically delivered I don't know).  After Amazon processed my \"return\", I could then choose to wait another 2-4 weeks for either my refund or another TV to be sent out to me.In the end after all of the lies and lack of service; Plus the fact that this was part of my sons Christmas presents (Yes when your son understands and deals with how you have to live on almost nothing, when Social Security takes almost 2 years to start paying, you go and spend $6,000 on his Christmas!).  I had to file a Visa Dispute with my bank and had my money back within a couple of days.  I turned around and bought the TV for $2,150 from Spencer's TV and Appliances here in Mesa, AZ.  It was in my house by the Friday after Christmas.","Date":"December 18, 2006"}

Unfortunately, my TV only worked for 12 hours before it would not turn on again.  My first reaction was that I got a defective model, but I understand that this sometimes happens.  I immediately contacted Olevia regarding the warranty.  Here's where things went south.  Olevia did not respond to my numerous e-mails regarding the problem.  I've spooken to their representatives on the phone a half a dozen times and while they finally agreed to replace the TV with a new one, I've yet to take delivery of the new unit after a month.  They don't seem to be able to give a definitive answer on the problem OR the resolution.  Very disappointing.Bottom Line: If your TV works, you're in for a treat as the picture quality is nice, with sound that can't be beat.

My only advice is read around for user opinions first before you buy an Olevia and take a look at their website and you will see that online tech support is nonexistent.  Try even calling their tech support # and you will see how unresponsive they are.Seriously, you get what you pay for.  I've had my Olevia for over a year and have had problems after owning it for 2 months.  My problem like most people is that it won't turn on.  Even if I dont watch it for a while, it won't work.  The only solution is unplugging the power cable for about 3-4 hours and plugging it back in, then it starts working again, weird.The only good thing about this TV is the price, and that's if you get 5 solid years out of it.  Other than that, video quality is poor (much worse than a Aquos or Sony), changing channels is slow and annoying, reliability is terrible, and tech support is terrible. I've cut my losses with this and hopefully you won't have to make the same mistake.","Date":"February 2, 2008"}

Hyde","ReviewID":"R3HWCWQDLZKZ2B","Overall":"bad","Content":"I saw in a local Wal-Mart ad that they were featuring a 32\" TV of another brand for $550.  In the aisle in front of the electronics department was this television for $500.  A larger screen for $50 less?  How could I not?  When the cashier was ringing me up, he asked if I wanted to buy the extended warranty on it.  I believe this is the first time I've ever bought the extended warranty on it and, at the moment, I'm relieved that I did.  I have now had the TV for one year.  About six weeks ago, my TV turned off on its own...I turned it back on.  About 30 minutes later, it did the same thing...turned it back on.  Ever since, it does the same thing.  Occasionally it will turn off and turn back on about 5 seconds later only to show a dropped cable signal.  I contacted Olevia's support line through their website and was informed that I should try to take certain steps to ensure that there was not a problem with the power supply.  The representative then told me that otherwise it would be a problem with the mother board and that Olevia was now bankrupt and could not honor the manufacturer's warranty as they had now been bought out and the warranty was voided.  I then informed the rep that I bought the extended warranty through Wal-Mart and he told me that I would have to wait until the manufacturer's warranty (....that was now voided?) ran out to try to get it repaired through Wal-Mart.  I am going through the steps to do so.  If you find a television through this company and you just can't pass up the price, BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!!!!","Date":"June 15, 2009"}

The red in the picture has gotten progressively worse to the point that no amount of tuning the color's gives what I would call a good picture.  In the last couple weeks, the unit has begun to do two things that pretty much put a fork in it.  First it will randomly shut off for no apparent reason.  That's not the worst though, it also will randomly go to a blue screen and emit a shrill noise at max volume.  That'll wake you up.

During playback of dark content, clouds of bright spots can be seen across the display. Sony has yet to officially acknowledge this latest stumble in their production quality control, but do a search for \"XBR clouding\" and you will find plenty of discussion about this very real problem.I have personally owned this display and the defect was significant enough to warrant a return. I opted not to get a replacement knowing that so many of these displays in the channel are affected. When (hopefully not \"if\") Sony is able to remedy the production problem and get non-defective sets to retail, I would easily rate it a five-star product and re-purchase one for my home theater.","Date":"December 1, 2006"}

The percentage of consumers who have purchased this HDTV and have reported the above problem ranges now from 69.85 to 90 percent. Perhaps, this may explain why the online and retail price has steadily fallen at a rate of almost $100.00 every 2-3 weeks.The clouding backlight issue is primarily visible in low-light conditions, e.g. when watching darker scenes.Sony now acknowledges that they have received some complaints. However, their response has been to send consumers a printed guide with instructions to optimize the picture quality. The fundamental flaw has not been addressed. Some \"blue ribbon\" technical support and repair service personnel who have made home-visits have characterized the effect as \"normal.\"I would suggest further that one type in the words \"Sony XBR clouds\" on Google.

I swapped my first 40XBR2 out for a 46XBR2.  The 46XBR2 was the worst of the four I'd had.  I came complete with the brightest and most widespread clouding and also one stuck green pixel!The problem is most visible in low lighting conditions and can be readily seen when watching dark scenes in movies or games.  I noticed my first set had clouding when watching Superman Returns.  During the scene when Superman flies into outerspace and is kicked back with his cape flowing out behind him, I noticed clouds with him in outerspace.  It was impossible to overlook this issue.Were it not for the superior picture during other conditions (i.e. a lit room showing content that didn't contain a lot of shadows), I'd have given up immediately on the Sony XBR2's.  However, I have been through the ringer with buying a set only to have to cart it back to Best Buy the next day.Sony is also officially not acknowledging this problem.  The customer service response for some members of the AVS forum has been alarming.

{"Title":"beware of clouds","Author":"hr","ReviewID":"R24TJ62TYPAHK3","Overall":"bad","Content":"sorry kids but i have to give you a heads up. we just got a sony xbr2 and yes - there they are - the infamous sony \"clouds\".for those who don't know what i'm talking about - on many of these sony's (no one knows exactly what percentage), when your screen is dark - you don't see a uniform black. instead you see clouds of grey. granted it's pretty hard to see them when you're watching a bright moving color image but for the price - sony should be embarrassed and ashamed.furthermore - they are deep into corporate denial mode (not unlike many politicians). in fact - up until very recently - they denied the problem even existed. recently however, they've begun to acknowledge that maybe perhaps some people could experience some problems under certain conditions and they're promising a partial fix sometime soon that may in some cases possibly reduce the severity of some of the problems.wow - way to take a stand sony!my advice?buyer type #1:if you are not the fussy type - this is an awesome tv and you should go ahead and buy it. for example my mother would probably never even notice the clouds so she would be thrilled.buyer type #2:if the clouds are going to drive you crazy - but you're gonna be too lazy to return the set - then you're just setting yourself up for heartache. i wouldn't buy this tv until sony gets it right.buyer type #3if the clouds are going to drive you crazy - and you are a fight-the-power activist type - then you might consider buying it at a place you can keep bringing it back to again and again until you get a good one.ultimately - the only thing that will get sony to change their behavior is if it becomes cheaper to deal with the problem than to pretend it doesn't really exist.for more info on clouds - google \"sony XBR clouds\" or check out the reader reviews on cnet.","Date":"March 10, 2007"}

Sony will not repair it.  Their explanation?  Watching too much tv will cause the television to malfunction and they can't do anything since it's out of warranty.  I explained that I only watched it three hours every other day on the average.  Their explanation?  Not watching enough tv would cause the television to malfunction.  Are they serious???  Both watching too much and not enough tv will cause it to break??  The image quality was great, but only for one year and two days.  Customer service is bad.

{"Title":"quit working 5 months after warranty...","Author":"Christian Hetrick \"Christian\"","ReviewID":"R19CMFB4GUTCAB","Overall":"bad","Content":"First... I know you want to know the problem before reading my complaint.Bad Controller CPU Board.  Which is going to cost me $800-1,000 to fix at the closest service center if I choose to get it fixed.  I paid $2,800 for this t.v. and 1 year and 5 months later I'm expected to pay an additional $800 minimum to fix it.  B.S.!!!!I am extremely dissappointed with this Sony product and their customer service. After I had done tons of research and read hundreds of reviews on how good this t.v. was I finally felt comfortable spending this much money on a t.v.  I was in love with this product at first. It was everything the reviews had said except it had slight clouding.  Well, 1 year and 5 months after purchase the dang thing messed up.I come home from work to watch some t.v....turn it on...and there was no picture.  After a few seconds I heard sound from the speakers, so I automatically thought it was the satellite.  A few seconds later the screen turned BRIGHT GREEN!!!! I unplugged the satellite reciever and tested it on the dvd player...same thing bright green screen.  Unplugged everything and was just going to use the t.v.'s menu, but the same thing.  I actually couldn't pull up the menu, so I knew something bad was probably wrong.I called Sony customer service and went through a couple of trouble shooting tips, but they ended up ruling it unrepairable over the phone and said I had to take it to a service center.  The service center tech called and said it was the CPU board and it would be $800-1,000 to fix.  I called another service center and they said the same thing.It was manufactured in Mexico, so if you are thinking about buying this model I suggest two things:1. Don't buy it if it says \"Manufactured in Mexico\" with a manufactured date between August '06 - December '062. Get the extended warranty.  Because lately I've seen reviews of the backlight going out or some minor problems that are happening shortly after the 1 year manufacturers warranty.","Date":"May 22, 2008"}

Although the television is nearly 3 years old, the first 21 months it was used at most an hour a day.  Around August of '08 the television began having issues sporadically.  I would have to power the television on a few times before it would turn on (despite the fact that the power light was on).  There was no sound and no picture, just a blank screen.  Finally in September of '08 the television never fully turned on (still a power light on, but no picture, no sound.  After contacting a repair man, I was told the main board is probably 'fried' and needs to be replaced at the cost of $4,000.  I found mutliple instances of this when 'googling' the problem!  Not having purchased a 2 year extended warranty, the television is now useless.  I'd suggest googling no picture, no sound on the KDL40XBR2 before making this purchase","Date":"October 20, 2009"}

{"Title":"ONE WORD - CLOUDS!","Author":"J. McNab","ReviewID":"R3L8NZVBPDMZK4","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have been through 4 XBR TVs and all of them have had clouding backlight issues - also known as 'mura'.  I swapped my first 40XBR2 out for a 46XBR2.  The 46XBR2 was the worst of the four I'd had.  It came complete with the brightest and most widespread clouding and also one stuck green pixel!The problem is most visible in low lighting conditions and can be readily seen when watching dark scenes in movies or games.  I noticed my first set had clouding when watching Superman Returns.  During the scene when Superman flies into outerspace and is kicked back with his cape flowing out behind him, I noticed clouds with him in outerspace.  It was impossible to overlook this issue.Were it not for the superior picture during other conditions (i.e. a lit room showing content that didn't contain a lot of shadows), I'd have given up immediately on the Sony XBR2's.  However, I have been through the ringer with buying a set only to have to cart it back to Best Buy the next day.Sony is also officially not acknowledging this problem.  The customer service response for some members of the AVS forum has been alarming.  Some have had Sony authorized repair techs come to their house only to be told \"this is normal.\"  When I called Sony, they told me to \"return it to the store\" if I was still within the thirty day period.I strongly suggest anyone considering this TV to search on Google the following words \"Sony XBR clouds.\"  You will find more than a few hits that will lead you to online forums.

{"Title":"Sony KDL-46XBR3 problems....","Author":"Alanb \"alanb7777\"","ReviewID":"RPA2RFKKMFP7","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased the Sony KDL-46XBR3 (October build date) and was initially amazed at the picture quality.  Then after having it on for about 15 minutes I noticed a severe \"cloudiness\" in the upper left hand corner and the lower right hand corner with a less severe but still apparent blotchiness extending across the entire panel.  This is especially noticeable on dark scenes and on blank inputs in the evening.  If you purchase this unit do so locally so that you can check it out in advance and take advantage of the return policy.  It seems that the majority of sets manufactured after September 2007 have this problem.  July/August builds (check rear of your set for date) for the most part seem to be okay.  More on this issue can be found in the AVS forum (Official Sony 46\" XBR LCD Uneven Backlight/Cloudy Thread).  This problem is apparently affecting all Sony 40\", 46\" and 52\" LCD TV screens.Now comes the worst part, Sony's official stand on this issue is that this is `not' a defect and is not covered by warranty (see above thread for more details).  So be absolutely certain that your set does not exhibit this problem as Sony is not offering any recourse at this time.  Their official stand is to deny that there is a problem.","Date":"December 7, 2006"}

I purchased this TV in hopes of having another outstanding high performance HD XBR but got nothing in return for my thousands of dollars but clouds from a blotchy bleeding backlight that is visible on every single input and in some cases on every single scene. I have now exchanged my set not once, not twice, but THREE times only to come up with a set that has a \"minor\"  amount of clouds. These clouds are a symptom of very poor quality control during the manufacturing process. The blotchy clouds also affect Sony's partner Samsung, as they share the LCD panel. Sony is aware of the issue, but seemingly doing nothing to correct it nor make the thousands of people who purchased a defective set happy. Please do your research before buying this TV.

Depending on the quality of the individual set produced at the factory, the cloudiness may be nominal or severe ... to the point it is very noticeable in dark scenes (e.g. througout the Diana Krall in Paris DVD).

So for me it was an easy decision to go with the 46\" Bravia XBR. Well, the problem is simple and echoes on through these reviews- CLOUDS! Whenever the screen is dark, changing inputs, dark scenes in movies or the like, cloudy patches distract the viewing. I called Sony customer support and they had me turn the \"power saving\" feature on, which darkens the screen considerably and they also had me turn the brightness down. So now the  clouds are gone and the screen is dim and unimpressive. I told them that they should give me a new tv but they refused. Seems illegal to me. The build date on mine is September 06. Sony is nuts for sending out products like this in the first place let alone not recalling them and replacing them with legit lcd tvs. Boo on you Sony!

It is somewhat hard to put into words but essentially one part of the screen will be lighter than the rest of the picture (this especially occurs in the upper left hand corner).  This is particluarly distracting when viewing darker scenes.  Judging from other people's comments, this is not an isolated issue and appears to be affecting many XBR2 and 3 series television produced after August 2006 (mine was made in September 2006).  A television set that costs over three thousand dollars should not have these problems.","Date":"December 12, 2006"}

The set is great but when viewing in a dark room during dark scenes or when switching between inputs I notice cloudiness in the areas of the screen that should be black. I contacted the manager of the Sony Style store here in Tampa and he informed me that I am not the only person with a defective panel and he placed me on a waiting list to receive a new set. He told me that at the moment they don't have any of these in stock and there are other customers with defective panels that are also waiting for a replacement. It seems that the panels that are affected were manufactured beginning in Sept If you own this panel and the Manufacture date on the back is September 2006 or later I urge you to view your set in a dark room , turn to a blank input or watch a movie with dark scenes pitch black, sin city, etc. I assume that about 1/2 of you will notice the cloudy areas of the screen","Date":"December 5, 2006"}

I called Samsung and they said that they would send someone out in about a week, but if the problem occurred during shipping, the waranty wouldn't cover the repair.  I decided to email Electronics Expo to request a new set and ask for a shipping label.  They emailed me and told me that they wouldn't accept a return of a TV over 20 inches!  I read the return policy and noticed that it only applied to returned items for unwanted items, not defective items.  Electronics Expo then ceased to return my emails.  I called and spoke to a manager who tried telling me that if the item was damaged while shipping, I would have to wait for them to be reimbursed by UPS before my new TV was shipped!

After 15min, HD channels started to freeze up. So I switched to SD channels, all were fine initially. However, after another 15min or so, similar thing started happening. We first saw lines/waves showing on screen, then picture started to freeze.At first we thought it was the cable box that was bad. We then tried 2nd cable box; same problem persists. We tried using different component cables, different inputs, hooking up coaxial directly to tv rather than the cable box. Same thing.

However, I am afraid I can not say the same thing for everything else.1) The regular Video input is very senstitive to interference. If you run the video cables next to the power cord (bundle together), you will see purple stipes on the TV. After I switched to HDMI cable, no more problem.2) For some reason, it does not allow the user to label the digital channels (analog channels are OK). It becomes very frustrating that you have to remember all the channel numbers.3) The remote controller is the worst. The commonly used buttons such as FAV. CH are small and hard to locate. It is extremely slow and take several seconds to respond to a button push.4) There is one design flaw with this TV.  When a cable card is installed, the fan behind the cable card slot is constantly ON even the TV is OFF. I contacted Samsung.  They initially thought it was a faulty controller board.  After replacing the controller board, the problem is still the same.  I am still waiting for the answer from tech service.In general, I am disappointed with this product even I am happy with the picture quality. It is just not that user-friendly.I also own a Sony KDL-46XBR2 (46\", 1080P). Similar picture quality but much user friendly.

{"Title":"Beautiful set but clouds are a deal breaker","Author":"MadeInDetroit","ReviewID":"R3V9HGJHRX19AX","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned this set for a few weeks now and I am consistently blown away by the picture quality.  True, standard definition programming doesn't impress, but it won't impress on any 1080p set as there's simply nowhere for those low resolution images to hide - you see them in all their ugliness.  HD programming, however, is simply breathtaking, and surfing the Internet and gaming in 1080p has to be seen to be believed.  This LCD has brightness to spare and the colors are simply incredible.  Vivid and accurate, this TV is amazing EXCEPT for what looks like gray-white clouds visible in particular during dark scenes.  My set is plagued by the clouds (the biggest cloud, about 4\"w by 8\"h, is in the bottom right) and I find them quite distracting.  These clouds are the result of the backlight \"bleeding\" through the liquid-crystal screen unevenly, and they are a common issue with this set.  So do your research - Google \"xbr clouds\" (the Sony XBR2 and XBR3 use the same LCD panel as this set) and read carefully before buying!Otherwise, there's a lot to like about this TV.  It looks much better than the picture on Amazon makes it out - the case is a charcoal gray, not battleship gray, and there is a nice silver bezel running around the entire set.  It's also relatively compact, as the speakers (which sound good) are tucked underneath the set.  The remote is simple though you'll probably want to get a universal remote if you have other equipment.  There are 2 HDMI inputs (plenty for me and if you need more, get a switch - they're cheap if you know where to look), plenty of other inputs and the menus are clear and easy to navigate.This is truly a 5 star set but for those darn clouds.  Here's hoping that Sony can somehow lift the clouds away!","Date":"December 27, 2006"}

By May 15 an opaque brown shadow had taken up most of the screen.  By May 16, the picture was gone, and in spite of many calls to Sharp \"customer service,\" the TV has sat unfixed, unreplaced and unwatched for over a month.  We are out nearly $2,000, and Sharp barely bats an eye.  The opaque shadow is a defect that appears in the form of a dark brown or black flickering band that spans the entire width of the screen.  What's most troubling is that Sharp is not customer-centric.  Sharp makes it easy to purchase the Aquos, but excessively difficult to arrange for  repair or a replacement.  We continue to spend extraordinary lengths of time on the (800) BE SHARP \"customer service\" line, only to be asked again and again to submit photos of the problem the television is having, then have those photos reviewed by Sharp's technical committees who then dispatch technicians to our house to review the problem and take pictures of the television again and wait for parts to be mailed so that the technician can return to install them.  If the replacement parts do not resolve the problem, arrangements are made for additional replacement parts to be sent out, all in a time-consuming trial-and-error approach that disregards the customer's interest in having what was paid for in the first place -- a functioning television.

{"Title":"Crummy Product and Awful Customer Service from Amazon","Author":"Vates Veritas","ReviewID":"RE03EMBLC3FP7","Overall":"bad","Content":"I know that when looking at a one star rating the immediate urge is to think of it as someone just out to trash ratings, but unfortunately this is not the case.To begin with, I'd heard nothing but good things about Sharp Aquos televisions, and when I looked on here a few weeks ago to see that the television had a PERFECT 5 star review I was impressed.I'll start with the TVs (yes, there were multiple) themselves.Despite glowing reviews, the Aquos appears to have pixel problems. The first one I got, it had hot pixels, which are a wonderful eyesore, especially given it's 'dynamic black' features, which make everything on the screen dark except the bright glowing dots of light in the midst of the screen.But, my hope and the high reviews lead me to believe this was simply a fluke... so I put in a return for another one. More time passed, they took away the old one, gave me a new one. Not a week into using it, it already began to have dead pixels this time, in the middle of the screen.If you don't care about dead pixels, the picture quality seems great, but... personally, dropping $1600 for a TV which has noticeable pixel problems? Seems like a waste of money to me.As for the service, now that I'm trying to actually get a refund rather than just a replacement, Amazon seems reluctant to process my return. I got an email today telling me to contact Sharp and see if this 'could be resolved' without having to return it. Now, I'm not a TV expert, but I'm not stupid either, there's no magic cure for dead pixels, and I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that my TV should not have to be serviced in my first 2 weeks of having it... I have yet to see how hard I'm going to have to fight about a return, but the idea that they're making it difficult at all to return it seems like a MAJOR reason to avoid buying a TV from them in the future.Also, the shipping methodology baffles. It's 'white glove' service... I'm not sure what that means, but I guess it loosely translates into 'makes it painful to have delivered'. For one thing, if you work 9-5 and can't take off for an hour or two, then don't bother. They are unwilling to schedule a time to drop it off that isn't a 4 hour window of time. They're unwilling to deliver on weekends unless you pay them an extra $40. They're also unwilling to drop it off at my managers because that would 'void the warranty'.The BEST part of it all is, once they take it in your house, they're also unwilling to set it up. Yes, your time and effort are solely so they can have you sign a slip of paper that says the box was generally in good condition. No setting up the stand or helping you lift it somewhere, that's all you... so more or less the time you have to take off of work is just so that they can put it in your front door. Also, they only send out a single man to do the job, so if you're on the second floor like I am, you'd better be ready to help unless you want them to use a hand truck and bounce it up the stairs.Overall, this was just a painful experience all around, and if your heart is set on this TV, I would say PLEASE consider getting it elsewhere.","Date":"July 17, 2007"}

Reliability terrible. After 12 months & 2 weeks (of course after manufacturers warranty expired) it failed. TV will not turn on and picture would go black while it was on.

{"Title":"Very poor video controls for aspect ratio","Author":"VC Geezer","ReviewID":"R2DLZ72R0TPC5I","Overall":"bad","Content":"Upon first receiving this product, the video and sound were good. Immediately noticed that their manual was poorly written and did not explain some of the controls at all. There appeared to be only 2 aspect ratio settings: the normal 4:3 and too wide.After about 2 months, finally got around to playing a 4:3 aspect DVD and found that the display is stretched horizontally, resulting in fat people. None of the controls will do anything to fix the aspect ratio - the zoom only makes the images bigger.Sent a message regarding these issues to Mintek's tech support 2 months ago with no reply.Conclusion: the hardware is okay but the software and documentation are very poor. Mintek has a long way to go before they will have a quality product.  I seriously doubt that I will ever buy any Mintek product ever again.","Date":"February 28, 2007"}

{"Title":"You get what you pay for","Author":"JT","ReviewID":"R342WPK8VIAS12","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this Mintek DTV-265-D 26\" this weekend because I liked the price, the built-in DVD, and the styling (in that order).Initial Reaction:  I was immediately disappointed when I hooked the Mintek up at home, especially when I compared it to my 2-year old Sony WEGA LCD 23\" runnig in another room.Picture:  The non-HDTV cable picture I tried on the Mintek is not very good...no comparison versus my Sony.  The picture was just not that sharp or bright compared to the Sony...it was dull to watch.Sound:  The sound on the Mintek is incredibly bad...my 13\" old TV has better sound.  The sound is very \"tinny\" and weak and detracted from enjoying TV show (especially MTV).Built-In DVD:  The Mintek built-in DVD player takes very long to load and makes all kinds of weird noises.  When the movie finally did play the picture was very good/sharp so I'll give them credit for that.  But later on it was again difficult and lengthy to switch back over from TV to DVD.I fiddled around with the Mintek throughout the day but was unable to make any improvements on my issues.Conclusion:  I'm packing up the Mintek and returning it to the store this week.  I'm going to spend the extra money and get a brand with higher end quality/performance (probably the Panasonic or Sony 26\").  The biggest eye opener for me was comparing the Mintek side-by-side with my older Sony...no comparison and makes me appreciate the Sony more.I gave the Mintek 2 stars instead of 1 star since it was the lowest price TV so you can't have too unrealistic of expectations.","Date":"February 3, 2007"}

Take note that this is a PLASMA TV so it's not all that new foo foo LED/LCD tech.  Back when I got this thing, it was equivalent to LCD's and LED's weren't out yet.  I wasn't looking for the highest quality picture and this thing delivered more than enough.  In fact I would argue that 1080p is almost unnecessary when you're sitting more than 12 feet away.Anyways, its a great plasma, and it's been working well.

A blown fuse on one of three boards. B.) A blown board.So far, trying to call LG on a Sat morning has been an exercise in futility in spite of their 1-800 robot telling me there would be a 5 min wait.Will contact them via email and see what they will do for me. It is out of warranty but this is a known problem. I am hoping they stand by their product.$2800 for a product that did not last 3 years is not a good buy.Will update later.Follow Up:Their concise email response:\"I regret to inform you that after reviewing your case, we have determined that we will not be able to cover the expense of the repair needed for your unit, being that the television is beyond its original warranty.\"Unfortunately LG considers 2 and half years an acceptable time-frame for an expensive consumer product.No offer to even pay parts.I LOVE electronics and this is by no means my last big screen TV...but it is my last LG.For the people that got more time from theirs, be grateful.Follow-up:We have a great, family-run TV repair shop in town.They advised me there was a problem with a circuit board and from what they could gather from various technical sources it was so poorly designed that it have failed of many LG Plasma's and had to be completely redesigned. The new board cost $500 and is supposed to be more durable. Let's hope.","Date":"July 24, 2010"}

Spent weeks researching the best value around.  Sharp is a good brand.  Purchased it online (first time I've ever bought something with this large of a price tag...because if something goes wrong...then what? Can't go back to Circuit City or Best Buy when you purchase it from someplace you've never heard of in NJ).I digress...Received the T.V. yesterday. I'm excited. Family is excited. Wired it up. Turned it on and PRESTO! A thin vertical black banding line the width of coffee straw is ever-present one-inch to the right of the screen's center running the entire height of the screen.  I'm upset. Family is upset. Dog hasn't stop howling. Worst fears of making big ticket online purchases are confirmed.Emailed 6ave and Sharp customer service that evening for resolution.  Received an email AND a personal call from 6ave customer service who took the time to set up a SHARP service agent to repair the T.V.  Sharp had me take some pictures and send them in for review, which I have done.  Awaiting action.6ave gets credit for jumping on the problem ASAP, but receiving a brand new T.V. that's broke from the get go is not a way to improve customer satisfaction and repeat future purchases.SHARP ARE YOU LISTENING?!","Date":"February 8, 2008"}

Instead what I got was a $900 piece of junk. The HD channels look grainy at best. The colors in standard definition are terrible. Sure, there are a lot of features that can be adjusted but none of them make the true skin pigment even close to real. If you do get a color setting you are happy with you still have to deal with the fact that people look unrealistic. Every person's face and skin look as though an artist drew them with oil colors. No amount of tweaking can get rid of this problem. Because Tiger Direct does not accept returns, only exchanges, I am now stuck selecting from one of the televisions they carry - none of which I am enthused about. Thanks for nothing Sharp.","Date":"January 23, 2008"}

The power button has to be hit several times to turn the unit on.3. The volume from one of the HDMI connections is very low.4. When contacting Sharp Warranty for points 2&3, they \"threatened\" numerous times that I would be charged if the tech could not find an issue.

After talking to Toshiba, I had an authorized tech out to check it.  He voltmetered one connector on the main panel and said the board on the LCD is bad but they don't make that part so you have to replace the whole panel.  The panel is not cost effective to replace since a brand new set will cost just as much. Toshiba would not offer any financial assistance whatsoever after speaking to a supervisor. They said the set is too old.Bottom line- if you are going to buy this TV get an extended warranty.  A TV this expensive should last more than 16 months.

It started to get vertical colored lines ,when 1st turned on, almost from day 1. Apparently this means the LCD screen will fail as soon as the tv gets out of warranty which mine did.  I have read dozens if not hundreds of complaints about theToshiba Regaza Tvs. They all have a similar sound with the screen failing and the sound still working after a year or two, usually just out of warranty.  In all the accounts I have read, I have never heard of Toshiba even caring about their tv problems. The Toshiba tv was fairly expensive too, approximately $ 1800.00 at the time. It did have a nice picture until it failed. So I guess if you want to purchase a nice tv that will last a year or two at the most then Toshiba is for you.

I myself purchased one of these and I'm sorry that I did.  Biggest misuse of funds I've ever made.  The picture quality on digital (non-HD) channels is almost unwatchable.  The HD channels are nice, especially for live sporting events, however there aren't enough true HD channels out there yet.  These LCDs are still quite heavy and you need a haning device the size of TX to hang it from your wall.  I'm going to stick with my large and very heavy CRT.  The picture of any CRT will beat an LCD or Plasma hands down.  I'm sure many will disagree with that statement, but try a side by side comparison for yourself and you will see through the hype.","Date":"September 30, 2007"}

This is a wonderful set with three HDMI inputs and many other options.  1080i/720p was fine for me since most cable HD is only up to 1080i anyway.Six weeks after delivery, two annoying defects appeared.  First, the TV stopped responding to the remote control after being switched off for a couple of hours or overnight; I can still turn it on using the buttons on the side of the chassis but it's a major PITA.  Mysteriously, the TV starts responding to the remote after warming up for 15-20 minutes.  Second (and even MORE annoying) is the random power cycling that happens during the first few minutes the TV is turned on; it takes about seven to eight seconds for a complete power cycle.  Having my programs interrupted several times in succession like that is NO FUN.Getting the TV repaired is turning into Mission:Impossible!  Toshiba directed me to a local authorized repair shop; they were decent over the phone but couldn't help me at all after a month of back and forth over the phone.  Now they say that their Toshiba FSE (field service engineer) tells them the needed part is NOT AVAILABLE!  I just sent a copy of my purchase receipt to Toshiba TACP and await a response as to whether THEY can either locate a part, or plan to replace my defective TV.I'm delaying any future purchase of Toshiba products until the successful outcome of this episode.  Hopefully yours won't develop a similar defect.","Date":"January 4, 2008"}

{"Title":"Beware","Author":"J. Lee","ReviewID":"RJ1H0PUFV3KZJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this TV based on all of the great reviews here on Amazon, on top of the amazing deal.  Can't beat the free tax right? Well, if I knew of all the problems that it would create beforehand, I would have forked over the extra $200-300 and purchase this in a store.First of all, Amazon ships this TV via Eagle which is probably the worst shipping provider out there.  They are unbelievably unprofessional over the phone and they didn't even provide the white glove service that was supposed to be included.  I guess this was my mistake for overseeing this part, but they still should have offered.  Anyways, I unpacked the TV (which is beautiful by the way) only to find out that the screen didn't even produce any picture!  I heard the audio just fine, but other than that, I got a TV that just didn't work.  I even had a repair man open it up to diagnose it and I was stunned when he told me that the entire circuit board was corrupt and that he would need to replace the entire thing.  I decided to just return it instead of replacing it since it was such a headache to deal with (I had to talk to Amazon almost 6 times just to get this completed).  I ended up buying another TV brand at the store and am more than happy with my decision.Maybe I got a lemon of the bunch or Eagle just didn't pay attention to the \"fragile\" note on the box when they were delivering it.  Either way, I will never buy anything online like this again.  My advice is to beware purchasing anything online that is expensive and that can be a headache to handle with in terms of the logistics.","Date":"February 12, 2008"}

{"Title":"Short and (not)Sweet Review for Toshiba 37 HL 67.","Author":"R. E. WORSLEY","ReviewID":"RXJAXEQLE1OIV","Overall":"bad","Content":"One of the few items that was not purchased through Amazon.com, but locally, for over $1,000. TV set was put in service in July 2007 and performed perfectly with beautiful picture and decent sound. About 2 months ago it started losing the video when changing channels using the cable converter. Power plug to TV had to be unplugged and plugged in to get picture back. This is happening with increasing frequency and soon expect the set to fail for good. Not a recommended product, in spite of it's still excellent picture and sound quality. R.E.W.UPDATE: March 14, 2012. This Toshiba TV started to lose the video almost daily with every back and forth change from HD to SD channels. Seeing that it was only doing this on channel changes with the cable box, which had been recently replaced with a newer model, I discussed it with a Comcast tech and he advised changing my cable input on the TV from HDMI to Component. This is labeled, \"ColorStream HD-1\" (or 2) on this particular set.It may have been that the changes to the incoming signal from the cable box was triggering a shut down safety circuit that protected the screen. All I know is, it has been 3 or 4 days now of intentional switching back and forth between HD & SD channels to torture test the different connection used, and there has not been one \"blackout\" yet.  Will I change my 2 star rating for this set? No. This problem should not have occurred with so many different sets. Had it been trouble free, I would rate it at 4 to 5 stars for picture and sound quality.As far as Toshiba products in general go, I have a Toshiba DVD/VHS player - recorder and a Toshiba laptop computer and have been satisfied with them all, so far. I am looking forward to a few more years of trouble-free service from this TV, also. If this update does not get another \"update\" then consider the problem solved, at least for this particular set. I have no way of determining whether the \"problem\" lies with the HDMI output of the cable box or the input of my TV set. As it stands now, \"If It Aint Broke,Don't Fix It\" sounds like my motto for the time being.  R.E.W.UPDATE - September 3, 2012 :  So far, so good. The old Toshiba TV is still working OK since changing the hook-up. Other than this \"problem\", I would have probably given this set 4 or 5 stars. Excellent picture and very good sound.

Then it would not start unless I plugged and unplugged it multiple times.  I found people on the internet with the same issue and they said to take if the power saving setting and always keep it plugged in.  Well this worked until I need to move it.  When I plugged it in I spend a couple of hours trying to start it, no luck.  There is a yellow light on the front that just keeps blinking 3 times in sequence.  Found out this is a common problem and requires that the power board mostly needs to be replaced.  Of course Toshiba knows of no problem with this model.

Here's the one you NEED to read from an owner of 2.5 years. It is not a matter of IF the LCD screen will go out, just a matter of WHEN. When being most likely within 1-3 years max. Toshiba KNEW when they sourced the LCD screens for this TV that they were faulty and had serious issues. Sony has a class action suit against them right now for doing the same thing. They went ahead and bought them in bulk for a song and installed them anyway to save money and increase profits while staying competitive in price. Not only does the TV blow up before dust can comfortably settle on it, any deep bass sound rattles the housing with a loud buzz. The picture is not all that terrific compared to decent, reliable brands (Hitachi, Samsung). All in all, you would be better advised to pile your money up in your driveway and burn it than buy this piece of inferior crap. Oh, the best part? When the TV guy comes and hauls it in to diagnose what I just told you is going to happen...the cost of the LCD screen replacement 1s over $1000 alone! That's right...not only do the low life SOBs at Toshiba continue to sell the inferior displays, they price the replacement parts higher than the original cost of the whole set! Add $250 into that for labor and you have a potential $1250 pile of Japanese garbage (plus original cost) sitting on a workbench in a TV shop on it's way to polluting a landfill somewhere.I have no axe to grind against Toshiba...you simply buy any of their products including the highly touted Regza line at your own risk. They are absolute 100% TRASH and guaranteed NOT to last 1/4 the time of other brands. All the above IMHO.","Date":"July 12, 2010"}

Tiger Direct shipped through Yellow Freight, who are INCREDIBLY inept. We tracked our package online, to find that it was on the loading dock, but were not contacted.  They eventually sent a postcard (their 1st communication to us) which stated that if we did not call to schedule a pickup immediately we would be charged a holding fee.  We called and set up a delivery, and had to have someone home between 9AM and 3PM. My husband took the morning off, I took the afternoon off.  At 2:45 I called to see where the delivery was, and was informed that there was no delivery scheduled.  After many phone calls, Yellow Freight eventually admitted that they had lost our shipment.We contacted Tiger Direct, and received conflicting information. One rep told us it would take 10 days to investigate, after which their only option was to send us a refund (b/c we purchased through Amazon). The other rep told us it would take 2 business days for the inquiry and then they would ship us a new TV.  But Tiger Direct never offered to take the lead in contacting us - we have to make all phone calls and follow up.At this point, a MONTH after we ordered the TV, the charge is still on our VISA but we have no TV, no resolution, and no hope in site.  We will (of course) dispute this charge with our credit card, but I strongly recommend that you NOT purchase from Tiger Direct.

{"Title":"Remote dies a slow painful death.","Author":"K. Paul","ReviewID":"R38NWHM6ENBR7J","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased my Sylvania TV/DVD combo about 18 months ago in September 2007. The unit itself has worked fine up to this point. The problem is with the remote. Around a month ago, one button ceased to work. Since then, the remote has been gradually losing functionality. I am convinced that this problem is not a result of anything that I have done since I treat my electronics with great care and this unit is not used by any children. The worst part at this point is that I cannot turn down the volume on the TV using the remote. Let's face it; these days many TVs just aren't completely functional without a fully working remote and even if they are, who really wants to get up and go to the TV to change the channel or volume. I know I am lazy but admit it, you are probably the same way, right? Actually, in this situation, it would be more than just inconvenient for me to have to use the buttons on my TV. I use it in my bedroom and, without going into details (because it would be boring), it just isn't feasible.I have tried to fix the remote myself with no luck. I am pretty handy at fixing things and have worked on everything from cars to appliances to home electronics. I have tried contacting Sylvania customer service for help but they tell me that they cannot do anything except sell me a new remote for $25. I am not going to give them anymore of my money for a remote which I fully expect to quit working just as this one has. They were pleasant enough, but ultimately unwavering in their \"policies\".I will never buy from Sylvania again or for that matter, Funai. Funai is the company behind the Sylvania name.My advice to you is to spend a little more money to get a better TV that also includes a better quality remote. I have never regretted buying any of Sony's products and none of their remotes have ever crapped out on me. As for the TV itself, it is still working but who knows how long that will last. I am not very optimistic at this point.Update, Feb 10, 2012:The TV still works fine. I guess I would say it is just as good as the day we got it.

This appears as a bright dot of primary color (in my case a bright red dot about the size of a pencil dot) that is always on the screen regardless of what is playing. This is a bad LCD display that needs to be replaced to fix this problem. I bought two sets and noticed this problem on 4 out of 5 sets in three different stores in two different states. Only one of five sets did not have this problem. I bought this set for my brother I was visiting in another state as a gift. We went through three sets in two stores before we found one without this problem. When I bought this set for myself when I returned home, the first one new out-of-box had this problem. The second one did not but developed the problem within the first day of use. I called Sylvania's national customer support. They sounded very professional giving their name and badge number at the beginning of each call. They requested I fax them information and the receipt in attention to Fernando in their Warranty Service which I did. After not hearing anything, I called back and they said they received the fax and I should wait a week which I did. I then called back after a week with no one calling me and they said they would escalate this issue to their corporate office and someone will contact me within 2 days. After no one contacted me I called back and their customer service and they requested I start the process over from the beginning and if no one contacts me in a week, call back. I asked to speak to a supervisor who told me they would pay for the part but I would have to pay for labor. When I reminded them that their warranty covers both parts and labor, they said they would escalate this issue to their corporate office. I also let the supervisor know the authorized factory service center he suggested I take the TV set for repair after they provide me approval from their corporate office has an unsatisfactory rating by the local Better Business Bureau (BBB) from hundreds of customer complaints. Checking the local BBB is a good idea before you get anything repaired. After waiting a week without anyone calling me from Sylvania, I returned the set to the place I purchased it from for a refund and bought a Samsung LCD at another store. I was attracted to this Sylvania LCD TV set because it was on sale for $229. Even though it is only EDTV which is 640 x 480 resolution the value was good. The Samsung I purchased is full HDTV. This will allow me to watch shows in full HDTV. Within a few years most TV shows will be in HDTV and this was a better investment for the future.","Date":"July 5, 2007"}

I wish I had gone to Amazon first... but... well live and learn. Since I got my new- new TV I have to say I love it! I'm watching HDTV for free with a cheep digital indoor antenna that I got from a local store. The picture is amazing. Watching Heroes and Lost in HD 5.1 surround sound is awesome. I have an Xbox 360 HD player and the image is fantastic. The contrast ratio on this TV is fantastic, and the 1080p DOES make a difference to a video junky like me.

This is conveniently outside of the warranty period.The symptoms of the fault capacitors include; -Taking longer than normal to turn on -Producing several clicking noises before turning on -The red power button cycling on and off several times before the set come on -Sound working but no picture -pink dots when turned on that disappear when the power is cycledPlease help me in keeping consumers safe and large corporation honest.

{"Title":"Great TV, so long as it lasts.","Author":"Shaun Thomas","ReviewID":"R5EBU1OY9KOV3","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this unit, the LNT4061F around July 2007, and was instantly amazed at the picture quality. For months, I used it for everything from video games, DVDs, HD programming, and I even used it as a computer monitor after I built a home-theater PC.If only the honeymoon would have lasted.Since March 2009, every once in a while the TV would refuse to start up immediately, instead it would click a few times, and when the picture finally appeared, there were pink pixels scattered everywhere. This could be remedied by turning off the TV and trying again. Then it got worse. The clicking would take longer and longer, and then instead of pink dots, there were multicolored lines. Finally, the TV refused to turn on anymore at all. Even having it plugged in results in endless clicks as the TV vainly attempts to turn itself on, each time with quick failure.After checking some forums, it would seem many of Samsung's recent TVs have this problem, due to bad soldering in the power-supply board. Eventually the solder, which is full of weak points, stops supplying a steady current to critical components, causing them to fail, one at a time until the whole unit is ruined. So I effectively paid $1500 for two years of enjoyment until the TV self-destructed.This kind of manufacturing flaw is generally cause for a recall, or at least a free replacement for the bad part. Unfortunately as the people in the forums will attest, Samsung is steadfastly ignoring the bad power boards, even under the threat of a class-action lawsuit. I personally take this as a bad sign, and will never purchase another Samsung product of any kind until the community agrees things have improved; it's just too risky to buy another TV which might die in two years. To contrast, the inexpensive JVC 32\" tube I bought in 2002 still works just fine.If not for the forums of people with the same exact complaint as mine, I would have called this a fluke--sometimes a bad TV makes it through the quality control, after all. This currently isn't the case; not only is the LNT4061 a risky investment, but even the newer 450s and 550s have the same problem. Stay far, far away from Samsung TVs, at least for now.This would have been a 1-star review, but that would be unfair, since I did enjoy the TV immensely before it failed utterly.","Date":"June 6, 2009"}
{"Title":"Samsung LNT4061F 40\" LCD HDTV constantly cycles on and off","Author":"A. Black","ReviewID":"R1JDQVERUMQYY0","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased my Samsung LNT4061F 40\" LCD HDTV a little over two years ago.  My family enjoyed it for the first 18 months.  Then it began to click when powered on, and it would take minutes before displaying the picture.  The FAQ on Samsung's website says \"At certain times, it is normal for a TV to make a clicking sound, such as when you turn it on after a long period of inactivity...  If you hear a clicking sound and your TV is operating normally, there is nothing to be concerned about.\"  Now there are a few thin black vertical lines on the left of the screen, and the TV constantly cycles on and off.Searching the web, I found many owners complaining of similar problems with their Samsung LCD HDTV.  All having the problem appear 18 - 24 months after purchase.I'm very disappointed in the quality of this set.  Especially since the problem appears to be in the power supply.  This component should be very reliable over time.  My old Magnavox CRT TV gave me over 15 years of trouble free service!  Now I'm told I could pay $350.00 - 450.00 to have a Service Provider come to my home and repair it?!  That doesn't sit well with me after paying $1,300.00 for the TV.Initially, I highly recommended Samsung LCD HDTV's to many friends.  Now I must warn them to be on the lookout for this problem.For a little more than the cost of the repair, I can buy a new 42\" LG HDTV.  What ever I buy in the future, it won't be another Samsung product.","Date":"January 29, 2010"}
{"Title":"Unreliable","Author":"Sorcy","ReviewID":"R1XKF0OCC6J7QC","Overall":"bad","Content":"Power Supply has a design problem - uses under-rated capacitors which cause it to click and not start after the warranty runs out. Samsung does not have a very extensive roster of service shops so you really need to fix it yourself. In addition, the upconvert from 480i to 1080 i is pathetic. You will not be able to see this feature at the store because they only pump in 1080i or 1080p on the screens. Burn-in is severe. Many other brands have a 4 pixel move function to prevent this - Samsung does not. I would recommend LG instead.","Date":"January 24, 2010"}
{"Title":"I will never buy a Samsung product again!","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R19TX3ZVKHBLCI","Overall":"bad","Content":"After 3 months of ownership, I experienced burn-in on the screen from not watching standard def TV stretched to the width of the entire screen.  I do not like watching things out of proportion.  It's annoying.  Also, I have a full-time job so it's not like the TV was on 24/7.  In any regard, I thought LCDs weren't prone to the burn-in issue, though after talking to the Samsung technician, I found this is not uncommon.I called Samesung and they had someone out to fix it.  First, Samsung came to my house and replaced the main circuit board (like a motherboard in a PC).  I had to argue with the technician that this hadn't fixed the issue.  He was trying to tell me the lines showing up on my widescreen movies and tv shows (where the 4:3 screen cut off on the widescreen), was acceptable wear AFTER 3 MONTHS!!!  For some reason the tech was really worried I was going to call Samsung again, so a week later, they replaced the screen.  This fixed the issue.  The technician told me to stretch the screen and watch things out of proportion for standard def and non-widescreen shows and movies or I'd experience the burn-in again.10 months later (15 days out of the one-year warranty), the on/off switch went haywire.  It was like trying to start an old car.  It kept clicking, and clicking.  After around 20-30 clicks, it would finally turn on.I called Samsung.  After much discussion, they basically told me \"too bad, so sad.\"  They would not put me through to a supervisor when I asked them to.  I basically got no resolution.I just spent $225 at a local Samsung-certified repair shop to have the switch fixed.  So, when I bought this television, it was right around $1000.  After 1.25 years, I spent and additional 22.5% in repairs.  Granted, it was 15 days out of warranty, but the company doesn't stand by a $1000 product.  That is a lot of money to spend for junk construction.  Too bad I didn't know it was junk before I bought it.Because of this television and my experience with Samsung, I will never buy a Samsung product again.","Date":"September 27, 2009"}
{"Title":"How to fix the power supply and save a bundle","Author":"Injunohc","ReviewID":"R3ISDC79NAA55Z","Overall":"bad","Content":"My TV started to turn on very slowly and have no usable picture if it turned on quickly. When it did start with any sort of a usable picture, the screen was peppered with magenta and cyan dots. Very crappy.It turns out the power supply has an inherent flaw that needs to be fixed. This will cost you 6 dollars if you have some basic electronics stuff like a good soldering iron and desoldering braid.  If you don't know how to solder, this is probably a bad project to learn on, unless you have a good teacher on hand.Remove the screws from the back of the TV, then slide the back off. Unhook all the connectors from the power supply board, then remove the 7 screws holding it in. The power supply board is the one in the center of the back of the TV. It has a bunch of capacitors and several heat sinks on it.There are 4 capacitors on the power supply board that are rated 1000 uf at 10V. 10V is obviously not enough, as they get unhappy quickly and start to swell as they fail. Curiously enough, there is another 1000 uf cap on the board that's rated 25V. I replaced the 4 with 25V (radial lead) electrolytic caps. They are the same diameter as the old parts, but a little taller, which doesn't matter.The old caps are recognizable by their markings, as detailed above, but also by the top of the can, which will have a slight dome shape instead of being flat. When you get them out, you'll notice the rubber plug in the bottom is about to blow out. Make sure to replace all of these caps, even if they don't look swollen.All of these caps (old and new) are marked with a band down the side with minuses on it. This is (obviously) the minus lead of the cap. Note that the new caps also have a long lead, this is the positive lead. Mark the component side of the board with a permanent marker on the minus side of the cap. The other side of the board has \"+\" markings on it, and I like to put marks on it so I desolder the correct pads. Getting the polarity wrong would not be a good mistake to make.Put the end of the desolder braid on the pad, add some solder to the hot iron tip and press it against the braid until the solder stops wicking up it. Most of the hole in the pad should be free of solder, if not, cut off the solder-filled part of the wick and repeat. Use the tip of the iron to heat up the capacitor lead in the desoldered hole. Once the remaining solder melts, straighten the lead by pushing on it with the tip. You should be able to remove the cap by pulling on it once both leads are desoldered and straightened.Push the new cap through the board, noting the minus band and long lead to confirm polarity. Once you're satisfied the polarity is correct, bend the leads out very close to the board. This will keep the cap in place as you invert the board for soldering. 67-33 rosin core tin lead solder works very well. Don't use 60-40 or 50-50, as the joint will not be as good. Clean the tip, tin it with solder and apply the tinned edge to the lead and pad. Add solder until you have a nice, smooth fillet. Once both leads are soldered, cut them off flush with the solder fillet. Repeat for the other 3 caps. Reinstall the board and reassemble the TV. You will certainly enjoy the results.","Date":"October 4, 2010"}

There were some issues with the sound where the speakers muffled and the volume on different channels would sometimes be astoundingly higher than others. But none of that really bothered me too much, if you want a nice HDTV you should probably pony up for surround sound anyways. The thing that really irks me is the cheap capacitors that Samsung used, which all blew out one month after the warranty expired. Now when I try to turn the TV on, it clicks for a few minutes with the red light blinking and when it finally powers on, I get a picture filled with blue and purple pixels. This is the same issue that has been documented by thousands of other owners of this TV online. Just do a quick Google search.","Date":"July 23, 2010"}

There are pink dots all over the screen and it takes several clicking sounds before it comes on. There are enough complaints on the internet regarding pink dots and clicking sound with Samsung TVs. Apparently this is due to bad quality capacitors used in power supply module. A TV should last more than 10 years without repairs. Period.===============================Owned it for a month now. No problems so far. Got it from Amazon. Delivery was good and on time. Didn't see any scratches on the TV or the box. Looks like they handled it properly.Pros: After one month of use there is not much to complain about. Over-the-air HD is absolutely stunning. Colors are brilliant. I didn't test any other HD source. Digital SD is better than analog SD. SD on this TV is much better than my old tube TV Sony trinitron. DVDs with a regular progressive scan player are stunning too. Color reproduction is very good. I don't think for a 40\" LCD an up-converting DVD player is needed. TV looks sleek and very modern. I didn't see any clouding or banding issues even with movies like the illusionist. Black levels are very good. There is no glare/reflection with this model (4065/66 had plenty of glare just like a plasma TV) so it makes it easy to watch even with plenty of ambient light. This is the biggest reason I went with LCD. PC via VGA looks great. Netflix online looked better than digital SD. USB input to play MP3 and watch JPEGS is a bonus. Side input is well recessed so the wires are not visible when using it. Low power consumption. Tons of input options with 3 HDMI input.Cons: Too many options to adjust picture. I have most of them turned off and just play with contrast, brightness, color, sharpness and backlight. Even after a month I keep adjusting the picture for various inputs. Audio from PC could not be played directly on the TV. I think the audio amp in the TV is weak. Had to listen via home theater system. Audio quality as such is average. This TV does not have auto fill mode for different formats. This is painful to keep changing the picture size manually while flipping through channels. Shiny (piano finish) cabinet is very reflective (but looks beautiful) and can be annoying sometimes. This TV is a dust magnet. Screen is fragile as with any LCD without a glass panel.","Date":"May 23, 2007"}

I updated the firmware to try to resolve it but now I have 2 problems, the clicking sounds and the color is splotchy and everything looks messed up. I just finished chatting with an online rep and he wanted me to send the unit to a service center for repairs but I may shoulder the bill. Apparently, there's a problem with some of the capacitors and may need to be replaced. I asked him about the firmware problem and he said, \"oh there's no way to reset it to factory settings or reverse it.\" Thus sending it to a repair center is useless. How can a firmware update mess up the TV's color distribution system even if I followed all the instructions to the letter.I liked the Samsung brand and have a 22 inch 1080p TV for my desktop PC but now they will be at the bottom of my list.

Now it clicks about 50-60 times before it turns on, and all you can do is sit there and wait.After doing a bit of online research, it seems that this is a common problem.  Evidently the parts that Samsung used to build the internal power board on are cheap and blow out after a year or so.  The only thing to do is take it in and get it fixed at a repair shop, which will cost hundreds of dollars.  Alternately, you can try opening the TV up and soldering new capacitors onto the board inside the TV, but you are doing this at your own risk.I'm very disappointed in this TV and will definitely go with a Sony next time around.","Date":"December 13, 2009"}

I have had this TV for only 10 months and was surprised to find that Samsung does not stand behind its products.

There is another rectangle in the center of my TV where other messages appear.

Munoz","ReviewID":"R1YX3LC5HPA8RE","Overall":"bad","Content":"i wish i would have read some of the more negative reviews before i purchased my real expensive paper weight, like other customers here i did my research, went to the stores, and finally decided to purchase the TV on april, a month later my HELL started! first the TV started to turn itself off and on, called samsung, they sent a repairman and he \"fixed it\" (changed the power source)...3 weeks later AGAIN!! same issues TV would turn itself off and it would make clicking noises as if it was trying to turn itself on again...once again called samsung and by this time my patience was really wearing out, i just couldn't believe that this could be happening to me, my brand new TV stopped working during a pay per view fight that i had invited all my friends over to watch at my house...i politely asked samsung about exchanging the TV for another one obviously this one was a \"lemon.\" They refused and told me that it was up to the technician to determine when it was \"unrepairable\" so i had no choice but to wait TWO WEEKS!! without TV and with my pride on the floor after i had to basically tell my friends im sorry and they ended up going to a bar to watch the fight. (i was too depressed to go)2 weeks after the repairman came and \"fixed\" it everything seemed fine...THEN TAMPA BAY goes to the world series for the first time ever!it had been quite a few months so i thought the problem was finally fixed, NOT SO MUCH!! :( in the middle of game 2 ONCE AGAIN! my TV fails me, this time the screen is totally black but now i can hear audio, called samsung (wooo hoo!) and now i really asked about changing this TV which is obviously broken, they gave me the same run around and were actually totally rude to me, telling me things such as \"sorry we cant help you\" isnt that what customer service is for? to help you?!!Now they told me that this is the last time they will attempt to fix it, and that if it does break again that they will change it, i called the repair shop, (where i already know the guys on a first name basis) and the told me that this time they will be changing the WHOLE panel, basically the whole TV, but that after this there is nothing they could change. i been waiting a week now for the part to arrive so they can come and repair it and im still WITHOUT MY TV!!Lesson Learned: NEVER again will i make a purchase on amazon for an electronic of such value, i would much rather go get one of the local stores where i know that even if the TV breaks i will deal with it  personally and they will exchange it, and even though i saved $300 through amazon ITS NOT WORTH IT!!stick to selling books and small articles please, that i will buy.","Date":"October 28, 2008"}
{"Title":"Samsung LN-T4061 - disappointed; maybe a bad one","Author":"The hycodude","ReviewID":"R293L2DEUJJ4P","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this TV after comparing it to other LCDs in a big box store.  I thought the Sony's had a slightly better picture, but for the money, the Samsung was a better value.  This TV has very impressive specs and has just about every connection you could imagine or need.I have a roof-top antenna that feeds two HDTV's - a two-year old 42\" plasma and a 19\" LCD.  I also have a 26\" LCD on a separate Mini-State antenna.  All three give excellent pictures.  I'm not an expert, but I have a working knowledge of HDTV's.  When I hooked this one up to the antenna and a 1080p upconverting DVD home theater (antenna directly to TV, home theater through HDMI), the picture was terrible.  It didn't matter if it was 480i, 480p, or 720p.  I tried adjusting the picture with preset settings and manually with no improvement.  Words and graphics were fuzzy and motion was blurry.  The only time the picture was acceptable was through the upconverting DVD player.  Even then, it wasn't obvious we were watching anything close to 1080p.I returned the TV to Amazon, which started out as a painless procedure.  I have no complaints against the trucking company, Novacor/CEVA.  They delivered it back to Amazon in 5 days.  It then took Amazon over two weeks to issue a refund.  The story I got was that the delivery truck was involved in an accident and the TV was damaged.  Why should that hold up my credit?  The TV and Amazon get two stars.  Novacor/CEVA gets four - I don't know whose fault the accident was so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.P.S. I went back to the big box store and compared a Panasonic plasma side-by-side to Sony and Samsung LCD's.  There is no comparison, the Panasonic wins hands down.  The LCD's were certainly better than my Samsung, but not as good as the plasma.","Date":"May 3, 2008"}

I purchased this set on Feb. 23rd. As of March 3rd. it has made it's way from Reno, NV to Sacramento ,Ca. A grand total of 132 miles EAST. I live 204 miles SOUTH of Reno!!! HELLO Eagle. Look at a map! From Sacramento it is headed south to Los Angeles. THEN back north to Bishop,Ca. It will have traveled 800 miles before it gets here. It would have been cheaper, and taken less time, to just have one of the employees throw it in the back of a pickup truck and drive it down here.Eagle gets a BIG \"F\" for delivery.

{"Title":"Rating is for both Eagle and Amazon","Author":"Ed \"Dallascoug\"","ReviewID":"R29VD2CQPUQP8H","Overall":"bad","Content":"I ordered this TV and it was shipped through Eagle shipping. I tracked the shipping as it went from Cincinnati, Columbus, and then to DFW. Eagle called my house on Thursday to schedule a delivery on Friday by 1:00 pm. At noon, Eagle called to find out how I liked my TV. Only problem is they never delivered it.Now Eagle claims it was never shipped by Amazon. Don't ask me what Eagle was tracking in their system. Why does a company call my house to schedule delivery of a shipment that they never even had? And why was this non shipment going from place to place. It appears they never contacted Amazon to report the problem either.Dealing with Amazon has been a mess. I called them 15 minutes after Eagle claimed to not have the TV. This was on saturday. They told me they would ship me out a replacement on Monday with 2 day shipping so I would get it Wednesday. I called on Monday to verify this and twice got connected to Amazon-India support. They suggested I wait until the orginally scheduled delivery date to make sure I wasn't actually going to get the phantom TV. They claimed to have contacted the \"hardline\" department electronically and let them know of my situation. I asked to speak to that department but they claimed there were no phones there.So I call back on tuesday to make sure the TV was coming. Of course they have no replacement shipping out to me. The support person was actually helpful and finally got another TV shipped but the estimated time of arrival is longer than the first phantom TV.So I got to spend a friday waiting for a non delivery. I got to make multiple phone calls to Eagle shipping and Amazon. I got lied to by Amazon about expediting my replacement TV. I had to follow up with Amazon everystep of the way to make things happen.Doubt I will be buying another big ticket item from them. Will not recommend them to others. And this is even before I get my TV.","Date":"August 25, 2007"}

Unfortunately, I have been unable to watch the tv yet because I am dealing with hundreds of dollars worth of damage that was done to my 2-week old carpet during the delivery.  BE WARNED: Amazon sub-contracts delivery for large items and then takes no ownership when their chosen company gets grease all over a customer's new floors.

{"Title":"Do not buy Samsung","Author":"William D. Turnipseed","ReviewID":"R3LG7CA4J05QDV","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased a Samsung television about eighteen months ago. Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it. From what I can tell from looking on television repair forums, Samsung televisions look to be pretty flakey.","Date":"June 22, 2009"}
{"Title":"Love Hate Relationship - picture shimmering issues","Author":"Ralph L. Gross","ReviewID":"RM0LAJ6RXZBPB","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased my 50\" Samsung HD DLP from Circuit Scity, and while I love having this unit, the picture leaves much to be desired at times.  Shortly after buying it, it developed horizontal dark lines about 4\" apart eminating from both sides of the screen.  There was also an effect called \"shimmering\" which basically looked like out of focus contour lines around bright sections of the images.  Fortunately, I purchased an extended warrantly plan. Circuit City staff was excellent. A technician came out, examined the set and determined it was the light engine.  He came back a week later with the part and that greatly improved the picture quality.  Shortly after that, it has developed dark shimmering. It's very noticable in low light images, such as when the scene takes place in a dark room or outdoors at night.  The dark shimmering makes viewing scenes almost unwatchable. I'll calling for another service appt now.  I've always had excellent luck with Samsung products but I'd buy another set if I had to do it over again and do more research of owner's reviews.  I'd never, ever buy one without the extended warranty.","Date":"November 26, 2008"}
