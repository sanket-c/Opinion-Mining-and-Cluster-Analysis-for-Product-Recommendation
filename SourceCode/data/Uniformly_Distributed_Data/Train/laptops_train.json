I purchased Andriod and iPad, looking for the perfect flexible, easy to use PC replacement.  No luck. Even a Bluetooth keyboard its not enough to replace the PC as a heavy typing/real work tool.So I purchased a Samsung 5 550.  I already used Google Apps extensively, and this was a natural extension.CH Rome's book gave me a fantastic look into the concepts and methods of using ChromeOS, as well as a detailed step-by-step method for using it.  It actually changed how I use computers.  My 'My Documents\" folder is now my Google Drive folder and I have file access from my PC, Chromebook, iPhone, iPad, and any PC I log into.I use the Chromebook as the heavy typing tool now, as its so fast and easy to start and stop, and stay where I was. I use a wireless mouse with it, and it feels so comfortable!  I could not have known all these capabilities were there without the book.  I can honestly say that less than $6 and a few hours of reading changed a huge aspect of my life.  Not many books can boast that claim.","Date":"September 23, 2012"}

{"Title":"Basic 500 MHz iBook","Author":"R. G. Michel \"rgmichel\"","ReviewID":"R1S40LH7VR7LZA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.","Date":"November 25, 2001"}

I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12\" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday!

At least, not at 1,199 bucks.The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4.

Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4. It's your choice.You get what you pay for.","Date":"March 30, 2002"}

{"Title":"Basic 500 MHz iBook","Author":"R. G. Michel \"rgmichel\"","ReviewID":"R1S40LH7VR7LZA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.","Date":"November 25, 2001"}

I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12\" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers.

{"Title":"It's not very good","Author":"S. Pierson","ReviewID":"R2YBF6AYQGBIW4","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought it thinking that Sony was a good brand, but they clearly have no clue when it comes to making computers.The first problem is the battery life.  At first, it could last 20 minutes of websurfing, but now it doesn't last five minutes of sitting still with nothing going on.  It immediately powers down without shutting down of hibernating.The second problem is the default hard drive configuration.  Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you've almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone.The third problem is the graphics card.  It's integrated with the normal memory and has horrible performance.  While I don't expect to be playing the latest games on this machine, it's not even capable of playing games that are ten years old with a decent speed.The fourth problem that I have is the LCD itself.  It's not very bright, and with any sunlight at all it's unreadable.Other than those, it's a pretty standard machine.  I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.","Date":"March 6, 2004"}

{"Title":"It's ok most of the time","Author":"S. Pierson","ReviewID":"R295WHG4GNUFCW","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention:1)  The battery life is horrible.  When you unplug it, it may tell you that it's going to last two hours, but even new, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes of just websurfing (if you are watching a DVD or anything like that, you'll be lucky to get much more than 5 minutes from the battery.)2)  It gets too hot.  I've found that different programs cause it to heat differently.  I tried running Seti@Home on this laptop, but that caused my lap to almost get burned.  You have to be very careful with that.  Also, the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop have come off because the heat of the CPU melts the glue on the bottom.  This has made a mess of the various tables I've put it on, as well as some pants when I've used it on my lap.3)  The sleep functions don't work right.  Every other laptop I've used has had a function to make the laptop shut down or go to sleep automatically when the battery gets too low.  This laptop doesn't appear to have this.  When it feels like it, it will just shut down with no warning.  This has happened at random times when I don't have it plugged into the power.4)  The drivers stink.  There are various problems related to Windows hotfixes and some of the specific hardware drivers.  I forget which one but there was a hotfix for XP that conflicted with the mousepad driver and caused the laptop to freeze up.  As far as I know, Sony never fixed the driver so I've left the patch off.I doubt I'll ever buy a Sony laptop again, but it's not the worst I've used.  I'll probably buy an IBM Thinkpad next time, because they are the best laptops you can buy.","Date":"October 22, 2003"}

{"Title":"Absolutely spectacular!","Author":"\"corman842\"","ReviewID":"R3VL5GLWV1E9PM","Overall":"good","Content":"First thing I should mention: I bought this laptop at a spectacular sale price. I paid $729 for this machine with 640mb of RAM (maxed out) and an Airport card with it. I highly recommend that you do max it out. I played with the 128mb version of this in Compusa and I noticed it to be significantly slower. When maxed out, this machine will run significantly faster than my 1.67Ghz Windows XP desktop in any task you will throw at it. On top of that, the Mac OS is far superior to anything ever put out by Microsoft. It's stable, easy to use, it just works. I have OS X Panther on this and I highly recommend it. I could never live without Expose, Apples far superior answer to the PC bar at the bottom. For those who are not familiar with it, this new feature in Panther will allow you to push F9 on the keyboard and show every window that is open. It will show exactly what is happening in that window at the moment, meaning that if I were to have a video running on it, the video would play on the tiny window as I look for the window I want. I click the window and it goes back to normal, only with that window on top. VERY USEFUL.Besides that, this machine is very well designed. The ports are on the side, no more reaching behind to plug it in. Its got a thick layer of plastic casing, yet is just over an inch thick. The 12 inch screen is amoung the clearest I've ever seen, and is suprisingly easy to use. The speakers are just okay, but you don't buy a laptop for speakers anyway. The snow colored design is absolutly beautiful, and is a nice plus. The screen is on a solid bar, not one of those flimsy PC hinges. This is the most solidly built, yet lightest, thinnest, most compact laptops I've ever owned or used. I have had several PC laptops before this one, and this is, by far, the best machine I have ever owned.By the way, the battery life on this machine is, to sum it up in one word, unbelievable. I  can get about 4 hours of battery life while watching VIDEOS on this, surfing the web I can get upwards of four and a half or more! The low power consumption of the G3 processor makes this an ultra-portable machine.For those who are considering switching. Don't be discouraged by the OS right away. It is something you will need to get used to, but after a few days you will never know how you ever lived without it. I now go back to my PC and just absolutly despise it every second I use it. I have now gotten used to the Mac and enjoy it more than I ever did with my PC. You know what they say, once you've gone Mac, you don't ever go back.Well, to sum it up, this machine is perfect. I have yet to come across any sort of flaw whatsoever. Mac has thought this thing through, their attention to detail is amazing. Everything down to the little hook that comes out just as you close the lid to lock it shut has been designed perfectly. This isn't something that has just been scrapped together by Dell or something, this is a powerful piece of computing genius that has been designed for people out to make the intelligent choice for their computing needs.

{"Title":"Absolutely Wonderful...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R17WPBU4J81UEN","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first ever Apple notebook computer and I must say I am terribly pleased. At first I was worried about not having a G4 processor in it, but after recieving my G3 800 iBook and running osX and a few games I must say, I can barely ever discern a difference between this and my imac G4.I ordered 256mb of ram with my iBook because this speeds it up significantly. You probably wouldnt notice many differences until you try to run more than one application at a time, then you start to feel a little sluggish.This computer is great, I was worried that maybe it was one of the crappy logic board ibooks but nope, the serial number is far newer than the ones that are at risk for bad logic Boards.And finally the look of the ibook is seriously cool. I can't wait to go to borders and study for awhile. While everyone else has the same colored gateway laptops plugged into the wall power that borders provides I can cruise with my trusty awesome looking ibook on battery. Also, the power adapter is small, and the thing about people saying the keyboard feels like plastic I disagree with, it is kinda ... hmm, hard to explain, but definitely a plus in my book. Im used to the hard cruching key boards and this one is much less crunchy.Also, the 12 inch size is simply the best size for a laptop. Anythin bigger and portability almost seems like a hassle rather  than a joy.Awesome computer. Dont forget to pick up that extra 256 mb of ram to get it up to 384mb making it much smoother.. actually, completely smooth... Heaven on earth lol.","Date":"April 9, 2004"}

Our teacher allowed us to use some new Ibooks that our school had just purchased. Everyone was so excited because these computers are so cool looking and everyone thought they were fast. We started our project and quickly realized that these were the slowest computers anyone of us had ever used. We were using wireless internet which may have contributed to the computer's slowness, but still it was pathetic. There were maybe 10 people using these computers and about 2/3 of us abandoned the Ibooks to go use the Imacs that our school got in 1998. It also could have been that (even with nortan anit-virus) these computers are very vulnerable to viruses. I'm not sure about how these computers perform in things other than the internet, but if you are planning to buy one of these Ibooks mainly for use on the internet, I would definitly not recommend this computer.","Date":"November 22, 2003"}

{"Title":"Overall a nice laptop for around $1100","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2Y4WQSYMYCE24","Overall":"good","Content":"... did not really review Model 2681CU1 as shown on this website.  This models comes with Pentium 4 -Mobile 1.8 Ghz, 256MB Ram, 20GB Harddrive, CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive.Like the first reviewer said, the 20GB drive should really be called 16GB drive, and in reality, because IBM reserves about 4GB to store recovery info, leaving you with about 10-11GB of hard disk space you can use, so if you really need a lot of hard disk space, beware that instead of 18.6GB, you'll only be getting about 10GB.Boot up on my machine takes about 1 minute with PC cillin Antivirus running, (booting to Win XP Home) so if you are used to 20 sec bootups, this machine will be slow to you on a bootup.  However, once all of the programs are loaded, the computer performs pretty fast.  Also, please note that the Hardrive is about 4200 RPM, so replacing the Disk for a higher RPM's will shorten the boot up time.IBM does not provide a lot of software, I believe I only had Norton AV 2003, PC Doctor and Adobe (among others).  You can type the Model number in IBM's website and get the exact detailed specs of what exactly comes (and does not come) with this laptop.What I like is that the Norton AV and all other applications do NOT load automatically.  You have to go to START--> Programs --->Norton AV 2003 and it will start installing Norton AV 2003.  My previous laptop had all of the software already preloaded, which made it a little more painful, because you ended up uninstalling a bunch of useless programs you did not need.The laptop's case is relatively sturdy and appears like it can take the ocasional bruising without major impact.Also, the BIOS on this laptops comes configured to MAX BATTERY mode, which means that if you are booting from the battery (i.e the AC adapter is not plugged in) your CPU Speed Step will keep the CPU cycles to 1.2Ghz maximum even if your power options says \"Always ON\".  Setting the power setting to AUTOMATIC (in BIOS) will fix this.BEFORE YOU ADJUST BIOS, call IBM tech support to make minimize your chance for errors.I was impressed with the quality of IBM tech support.  I 'd say that I got a live person within 2 minutes and the tech support was somewhere in the US, as opposed to overseas.Battery life seems to be close to 2.5-3hrs, though I have not had a chance to test it out fully.  When fully charges, the battery indicator says that 3 hours is left.Beware that this laptop does not come with a floppy drive.I think that the reason this Laptop costs $1100 is that there are Pentium M chips that are out, replacing P4M's.Oh, and last thing, I have IBM T23 at work and found that the ultrabay drives used with T23 are compatible with R40's (all except R40e) drives.  Check IBM's website for verification. ...","Date":"October 30, 2003"}
{"Title":"Nothing cheap about this","Author":"scott_from_dallas","ReviewID":"R3AJYA2M4P3TRY","Overall":"good","Content":"Sorry to break the news to the previous reviewer (please -- you really have to use a product more than one day to give a competent review), but there is nothing cheap about this laptop. Perhaps he had it configured with a little less power, but mine works as well as any laptop I've ever used.This is my second laptop, but the first one was a small 486 I bought because the size was cool. Now, THAT one was cheap. IBM has made the best laptops and have the best service. The only question for me was initially, whether I wanted to pay for it, and then, which one do I get. Mine is configured with a 2 gig chip, a 40 gig HD, and 512 Meg of RAM. Please don't skimp on the RAM or you will wonder whether your system is slow.It came complete with Windows XP (which I don't care for) and I had to reconfigure everything so it looks more like Windows 2000, which I have on my other desktops. I use the laptop for surfing on wireless internet connections -- both home and away, writing letters and other documents, doing some financial spreadsheets, and will soon be doing some film editing work. The trackhead (whatever its called) works MUCH better for me than the simple trackpad. But the pad is there, and you don't have to use the eraser shaped head in the middle of the keyboard if you don't want to. I don't remember hitting the head and moving the mouse when I typed the letters \"h\" and \"g\" (or whatever two keys it is between) so if you don't like it, it should never interfere with your work.The screen is great! Big enough to have your desktop arranged like you like and plenty big to watch DVDs. The CD/DVD tray comes out, and feels somewhat flimsy, but you shouldn't have a problem taking care of it. On the left side are the various inputs, including (at least on mine) USB, firewire, and s-video. For you multimedia types who want a PowerBook for creative tasks but need a PC to do real work on, don't worry -- the Thinkpad has what you need. I considered a PowerBook and might have actually bought one (even though I'm firmly grounded in the Windows camp), but the prices were just way too much, and I would need a boatload of additional software for the Mac. While your emotional side might miss a PB (Apple does have a knack for appealing to the emotion), the logical beast in you will realize the TP has what you need.The unit will, like every other high powered laptop, get hot on bottom. Mine doesn't create much of a problem. When I'm using it on my recliner, I put a pillow under it and I am fine. When using it on a table or desk, there is no issue.Battery life on every portable unit is always disappointing. I've had my TP since March and have used it some, but not a great deal (once or twice a week on average, but lately increasing). I'm at a little more than three hours, and there is an indicator that clearly gives you an idea how much time you have left. If you fly cross country or longer than 3 hours and need all that time to work, you will need multiple batteries.Finally, I haven't noticed any pixel loss on my screen. The unit is solid enough to take most anywhere. While I treat all my equipment well and don't dropkick anything, if you are a bit rougher on your stuff than I am, I don't think you will need to worry. But don't take this review for any advice on how the IBM will work if mistreated.","Date":"October 23, 2003"}

I think it might be from the way IBM had set this up its starts out at 15.6 gigs on the hard drive and only leaving you with 10 gigs free on it.

{"Title":"FANTASTIC laptop but has some minor quirks","Author":"SWL","ReviewID":"R1JDDRPY4JI17C","Overall":"good","Content":"Greetings all, the other review by Sherrila Levin for this item is inappropriate and overzealous (I'm a die-hard Mac fan).  Make no mistake this is a PHENOMENAL computer yet there are some buts...In a nutshell:PROS:- You're walking around with 17\" gorgeous object of envy that has a stunning display great for games, DVDs, doing PhotoShop/Illustrator work, etc.  The great screen ratio is perfect for design apps with palettes, toolbars and the like.- For a laptop, GREAT sounding speakers- Backlit keyboard: Nifty little feature that is best when you have it plugged in.  Otherwise, works well, but is an added drain on the battery when going mobile.  Though, the AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR that adjusts screen brightness and backlight is AWESOME when it fades in to let you know it's working.- Usual suspects of big hard drive, fast processor, pretty snazzy 3d card, lots of ports, DVD & CD BURNER and loads of RAM make for a REALLY AGILE portable workhorse.- It's always great owning something where you can see the designers put oodles of love and obsession to detail.- Slot loading drive (has no breakable moving doors)- Does not generate heat like previous G3 models or earlier G4sCONS (Few and almost trivial, but worth noting for the uninitiated):- 6.8 pounds isn't the lightest thing in the world if you're lugging it around on one shoulder- Shell is slightly soft and gives way to some small body damage easily (I accidentally dropped mine on the corner from about 1.5 ft off the ground - now have a nice ding.  Other users/reviewers have also mentioned this issue as well).  Just don't be as klutzy as me and you should be fine.Hope this helps.","Date":"November 17, 2003"}
{"Title":"A joy to use, and road-ready to a T","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1PMOFN76IEBRH","Overall":"good","Content":"This aluminum-shelled gem marries beauty and brawn so well that that owners of lesser laptops will surely have a hard time hiding their envy. It's fast and capacious and, like other Apple products, a joy just to take out of the box and see how Apple has thought about every step of the user experience, from unpacking to setting up the built-in wireless networking (a total breeze, and I'm a klutz at that kind of thing). In that same vein, there's the G4 Powerbook's keyboard that automatically lights up with a soft glow from underneath the keys as the light in your office or your airplane cabin dims. It's a small thing, but indicative of a genuinely respectful, design-centric, user-oriented mindset that no other computer company can match.The display is lovely to behold and s-h-a-r-p, and the wealth of (count 'em) 1.3 million pixels makes it hard to go back to my 15'' flatpanel iMac desktop screen. Watching a DVD on a Powerbook screen this big and this good is about as satisfying as visiting my local cineplex, sans the sticky floors.Like the new G5 desktops, the G4 Powerbooks strike me as quite hi-tech and futuristic. That's not a bad thing, but it's a far cry from the happy candy-colored iBooks of a few years ago. The G4 Powerbooks are also not as \"warm & inviting\" as the current generation of elegant white Powerbooks. The persona of the G4 machines is a bit more stand-offish, stark even, and you either like that or you don't. I think they're plenty gorgeous but, at the risk of sounding sexist, my hunch is that it's a 'guy' computer, and that a lot of women won't take a shine to these machines. But I'll let Apple's marketing department worry about that.Finding Panther (Mac OS 10.3) loaded on this machine was a greater boon than I'd imagined. I've used 10.2 (Jaguar) since it came out in August 2002, but Panther is such a big step forward, it almost qualifies as a whole new operating system -- without the learning curve. You can log out without quitting open applications, for instance, in a matter of literally seconds. The improved Finder -- which appears to be modeled in part on Windows XP, though no Mac user would admit that without the benefit of thumbscrews ;-) -- makes navigating through complex hierarchies of folders and files a snap, and it's easy to customize. Also, Apple has brought back color labeling of files and other items -- an OS9 staple it stupidly discarded when the company launched OSX a few years ago. There are more than 150 other big and small improvement (wait'll you get a load of a feature called Exposé, which displays all your open windows, across applications, at the roll of a mouse!), but this is supposed to be a review about the computer, not its operating system.Well then, the G4 17'' Powerbook is a tactile and esthetic pleasure to use. The fit is tight, the finish beautiful. Everything just works right out of the box without the user having to study manuals or spending time on the phone with tech support. I would gush about this machine (and so far I have!), but there are a few minor points of criticism, too:- Apple does sometimes put good looks over practicality. The shell of this Powerbook has no ridges on it -- it's just this sleek, smooth expanse of aluminum. Very purty, but since this is a large and relatively heavy laptop, you're quite likely to let it slip from your grasp at one point or another. Some kind of grip would have been a good idea. Also, there's a latch at the front of the machine that you push to unlock the screen. The latch is almost perfectly flush with the front of the case (so as not to visually break the sleek line of the shell, I'd wager), and I find that it sometimes takes two or three pushes before the screen pops open.- The material looks like it might scratch easily (but I'm trying not to find that out first-hand). At this price -- 3,000 semolians! -- Apple should have included a soft leather sleeve or something, so that you can toss the thus-protected Powerbook into a shoulder bag or backpack and not worry about it. I ordered a neoprene third-party solution called a Sportfolio (40 bucks) that does the job.- I've been forced to use them for years and I still don't like 'em: trackpads. Ugh. Get a mouse. Kensington makes one that works well with a Powerbook; it has a retractable USB cable that stores inside the device when not in use.- The power cord plugs into the side of the machine. That's a bit unsightly. It should have been in the back, where it essentially doesn't show.- More visual clutter: the sides of the machine. They're outfitted with a bevvy of ports, including a Firewire 800 port and an S-video socket (excellent!) and no cover (not so excellent). I realize doors can easily break off, but maybe a molded rubber strip would have (a) been better-looking, and (b) kept dust, dirt, and lint out.- Apple should take a cue from the automobile industry and its included standard 3 year/50,000-miles warranties. The Powerbook has a one-year warranty and only 90 days of phone support. To extend coverage to three full years, you're supposed to purchase a protection plan for -- gulp -- 350 bucks. I guess I'll do it, but I have the uncomfortable feeling I'll be paying for a few years' supply of Steve Jobs's black turtlenecks. I'm OK with him playing hardball with Disney, he just should let up on his own loyal customers a bit. ;-)I've had the G4 17'' Powerbook for a week and intend to really put it through its paces in weeks and months to come. So far, the verdict is very positive. The first Apple Powerbooks, in 1992, also cost multiple thousands of dollars, just like this one. For the same money (less if you count inflation), you can now buy a super-good-looking supercomputer that is a kick-ass music player, an excellent movie-playback machine, a top-notch number cruncher, a high-powered portable recording studio, a serious photo- and video-editing tool, and on and on... I shrugged when I heard about Apple's plans, three or four years ago, to turn their computers into \"hubs for the digital lifestyle.\" But the company did just that, and no portable computer today is a more capable, pleasure-to-work-with digital hub than this gorgeous 17'' G4 Powerbook.Addendum: A few weeks after I wrote this review, I'm on a plane, with the Powerbook in its neoprene sleeve tucked safely in the overhead luggage compartment. Well, maybe not SO safely after all. After touchdown, people start grabbing their bags, anxious to get out -- and some idiot yanks her own luggage out so hard and carelessly that my computer goes flying. It drops in a graceless arc, like a limply flung brick, and lands with a thud that churns my stomach. I actually gasp. This is more abuse than any consumer laptop can handle. After all, it's a fall from almost seven feet high; surely the case is cracked, or the screen broken, or the hard drive knocked out of whack and my data lost -- or all of the above.  Absurdly enough, though, I'm wrong. I zip open the sleeve, fingers trembling, but all is as it should be. The aluminum case is un-dented and as tight as ever; the screen unblemished; the hard drive unperturbed. Now, I wouldn't care to duplicate this little involuntary experiment. Clearly I got lucky. But it's also proof that Apple builds its Powerbooks with real structural integrity -- equipped to deal with the rigors of the road, and with the abuse inflicted on it by hapless users and clumsy strangers alike.","Date":"February 1, 2004"}

This is not the machine you prop up on your legs to read Google News in bed. Hopefully you have something better to do with your US$3K-$4K anyway.I'm a professional media designer and image maker, and I replaced my old dual-processor Macintosh with the 17.1\" 1.33 GHz Powerbook. This is a machine to tote onto a job site or to a presentation and produce great work...perfect for freelancers and those who might not work at their home base all the time.Two great things I've not seen other reviewers mention are the audio hardware quality and dual-monitor support; these can't be under-rated. My Dell PC's audio line out is noisy and full of hiss, while the Powerbook's line out is so quiet that many musicians simply plug it into a club's audio system and it sounds great. Dual-monitor support is second to none. After chafing a bit at the widescreen nature of the screen (i.e., only 900 pixels tall), I instantly shut my mouth when I plugged in another monitor and it immediately started running at 1600 x 1200.While there are some compromises one must make in going mobile, this machine does not disappoint. Rear legs for improved elevation, easy expandability, even a real tray for the DVD-RW drive ... all these things have been removed to make the machine as streamlined as possible. But I happily accept all these compromises to use a Macintosh that is powerful, relatively lightweight, portable...and sexy as all get-out.

{"Title":"Great computer, few flaws","Author":"Robert Graves","ReviewID":"R32N71H5V7YZ9X","Overall":"good","Content":"Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.","Date":"February 18, 2004"}
{"Title":"Best computer I've ever owned","Author":"Zach Everson \"Writer. Editor. Consultant.\"","ReviewID":"R2BQVGJ24DBUVS","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a 12-inch Powerbook after I gave my old Sony Vaio notebook the Pete Townshend treatment - I put my fist through it. (Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.) I hadn't used a Mac in years, but I decided I'd had it with Microsoft and Windows. All it took was one weekend and a good book - \"Mac OS X: The Missing Manual,\" by David Pogue -however, and I mastered the machine.(Other than the size of the screen, the 17-inch model is the same as the 12-inch one.)SOFTWAREThe computer comes with some great software. iTunes is the best media player on the market. I have almost 5,000 songs stored on mine. With the search function and browser display, it is easy to find a particular song. iTunes also keeps track of the number of times you've listened to a song and it allows you to rate your songs. It's easy to create a playlist. Also, burning one of those playlists onto a CD can be done with one click.Safari is a great web browser. It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I've never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don't allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven't mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software.

Burning a DVD requires a lot of memory and can take a while - this way you can use other applications while burning a DVD (on my old PC, if I was burning a CD, I couldn't use anything else). The hard drive space is really cheap.

I called Apple and had to spend $300 for them to put in a new hard drive and some other hardware. They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I've spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications. No idea why the hard drive went. Hence I dropped the rating from five stars to four.","Date":"April 13, 2004"}

It's that powerful and versatile, and if you're a windows user, the design of the OS X operating system that it runs will enhance your experience and workflow in ways you can't even imagine.  The aluminum frame beats the old titanium design easily.  Solid, resistant to scratches, better heat dissipation.  Close the lid, then slam it around, drop it, prop it against the wall and kick it over.  You'll break your foot before you break the laptop.  The display is large enough, and the text rendering is sharp enough, that you'll forget entirely about workspace issues.  A piece of advice: Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it, and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3.  Use it whenever you're working at a tabletop or desk.  Freaking brilliant.  This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be.","Date":"November 13, 2003"}

{"Title":"Small, sexy and built like a tank. 4½ Stars","Author":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","ReviewID":"R4PXGJH33IRK0","Overall":"good","Content":"This new laptop replaces a Toshiba A15-S127 that we bought 3 months ago and one that died 4 weeks later when the LCD screen cracked. This one still confuses my wife and me given that the thing spent most of its time in its carry case and it bore absolutely no external damage on the laptop's shell. To add insult to injury the store we bought it from wanted to charge us literally 2/3rds the cost of the thing to repair it, manufacturer's warranty be dammed, I guess. Suffice it to say that we won't be buying Toshiba products again nor shopping at this store (who's name, by the way, rhymes with Stomp Youse Say), ever again. I would have reviewed the S127, but what's the point? We hardly had it long enough to get to know it.When Sony began producing computers, I was less than impressed. Yet another big name producing very shiny products that look great while using second rate parts that deliver underwhelming performance. That was several years ago and while I still don't care for big name brand PCs, they are still good machines. Even though I build my PCs from parts I choose, I can't build a lap top, and after the Toshiba debacle, anything would have been an improvement. Truth to tell, I didn't really like the Toshiba from the start, but my wife wanted something cheap to take to work and use it to learn Spanish, practice her mathematics and watch the occasional movie, and the Toshiba did a fair job at all of those things. The Sony PCG-505DX is a vast improvement in every category, though it was twice the price.The 505 features a 1.5 Ghz Pentium 4 Centrino processor- possibly the most important consideration when buying a laptop these days. The CPU scales its speed and processing ability to conserve power and extend the usability of the lap top. With the full charge the 505 will run for nearly 5 hours when doing things like word processing. Obviously, the more things you do, the shorter the battery life will be. The Vaio also sports a whopping 512 mb of RAM, an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 16 mb of its own RAM, (a lot of laptops video RAM is actually shared with system RAM and performance takes a real hit), a 400 Mhz FSB, an 11 mb IEEE 802.11b `Wi-fi' wireless network adapter, 1 PC-MCIA slot, 2 USB + 1 IEEE 1394 FireWire ports, CD-RW & DVD player combo drive, Network and modem ports, VGA port, and a Sony memory stick slot. All of this is packed into a very small and very attractive box,. The casing also has a lot of polished aluminum, which will no doubt enhance the durability and life of the computer.Though the S127 was fully 600 Mhz faster, the 505 out performs it every category- it boots faster, loads programs faster, and came with much better software pre-installed. I actually plan to keep all of Sony's own music and video programs, which is odd as I usually spend the first day or so with any laptop I have owned blowing out all the junk and promotional software that comes with them. About the only things I removed was AOL and that really terrible office package known as Microsoft Works. Everything else will stay. Sony also wisely partitioned the 60 Gb hard drive to make mirroring the drive much easier. (What they didn't include was a system restore CD or DVD and instead require you to make your own. If you want to do this, make sure your have a stack of CD-Rs handy, because it will take 9 of them).The 505 is actually pretty much the same size as my old 486 Compaq Aero, which itself was a dynamite little machine. I love the Vaio's design and feel- it's sturdy, incredibly well made and given the luck we have had with our other Sony products, I suspect this little beauty will be around for a long time. About the only real complaints I have about it is the speakers sound terrible, but then again, this is a laptop and a general gripe about laptop keyboards in general- I just can't get comfortable with any of them. This is the best laptop I have ever owned in both performance and build quality. The screen image quality is great, the keys and controls intuitive, I only wish we had bought this first instead of the Toshiba.","Date":"December 4, 2003"}

Looks are certainly deceiving.  Two months later, I left the notebook idle for 5 minutes while I attended to something else, and when I returned and touched the touchpad to activate it, the whole thing shut down and wouldn't start up again.  Sony Support told me to take out the battery, hold down the power button, etc., but nothing worked so it was sent in for repair and I received it 4 working days later.  A month and a half later, in mid-March, I touched the touchpad to move the mouse and the notebook died again!!  It was completely unresponsive to any attempts to revive it.  I am incredulous at the quality of this product.  Sony should really get its act together.  If there's one thing I have learned from using this product, it is to constantly backup my files.  When the notebook was working, it worked beautifully, but it's intolerable to have to send it in for repair every couple of weeks.  I would strongly urge prospective buyers to consider other laptops, e.g. the IBM X40.","Date":"March 28, 2004"}

Though many people think 12.1\" screen is smaller, I do not think so, it gives you an 1024x768 resolution which is very good, unless you are expecting your laptop to be a TV replacement to watch movies. I am a student and use my laptop for heavy software development and I never faced any problem with the CPU performance. Till now my experience with this new centrino processor is awesome. As for the battery life issues, it cant be better than this. Though compared to the other centrino machines this machine is bit expensive, but I pay for the style and brand and the quality of the product. Its been 3 weeks since I bought this notebook, and I never repented for paying the extra buck..AS for the other side,You have to make your own recovery CD's, which is very important step before you do anything with the laptop.. And I could not upgrade to windows XP professional, it gave me some virtual memory low message and kept on restarting after the installation was done, So I had to do complete installation of XP Pro. If the XP pro upgrade is not successful for you also, do not worry. You can put the recovery CD 1 and get all the software installed back on the clean XP professional. So there is a way around to keep the software which came with the machine and have XP pro.. And I am little disappointed SONY did not provide us with a third party CD writer software, we are forced to use the inbuilt XP writer, which is slow compared to NERO cd burner software or Roxio easy cd creator.. Overall you will get the value for your money..And I do not understand why Amazon display's different specification on this website than what we see on sony. My laptop has an L2 cache of 1MB, but amazon displays here it as 512 KB which is very confusing. I didnt buy my notebook on Amazon becoz of that confusion..","Date":"December 29, 2003"}
{"Title":"HORRIBLE SUPPORT FROM SONY","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3L26OMAOOYIKI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this laptop at the end of November 2003.  I liked the laptop - lightweight, good battery life (for what I need), compatiable for wireless internet - quick - keyboard takes a little getting used to, but not bad once you get started.  I was very happy with my purchase.At the beginning of January I accidently picked up this laptop by the screen.  Apparently this caused a VERY LARGE THUMB PRINT ON THE LCD SCREEN.  So words of advice, never EVER touch the screen.In the middle of January I set my laptop down.  When I came back it would no longer go on.  I called Sony help on a call that lasted 3 hours.  WE TRIED NUMEROUS THINGS TO GET THE COMPUTER TO WORK AGAIN WITH NO AVAIL.  I WAS TRANSFERRED TO ABOUT 5 PEOPLE DURING THIS CALL.  FINALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS THE SHIP THE COMPUTER TO SONY FOR REPAIR IN CALIFORNIA.  I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS.  So off the computer went to California.  Since the computer was ONLY 2 MONTHS old they said whatever was wrong would be covered under warranty.WELL HERE IS WHERE THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS........Remember the THUMB PRINT I told you about from touching the LCD screen.  They were trying to charge me $795.00 to replace the LCD screen and would not do any repairs until I agreed to pay the $795.00 for the replacement of the LCD screen.  Not that I particullary like having a thumb print on my LCD screen, I like even less having to pay $795.00 after just purchasing the computer in November for $1,799.00.  Touching the LCD screen SHOULD NOT CAUSE SUCH A THING.  I had a DELL laptop for 4 years and touched it on many occasions and NEVER EVER had a problem.  Not once did the DELL stop working for no reason or break because I touched the LCD screen.After 2 weeks of fighting with SONY........probably a GOOD 15 hours total on the phone, it was finally decided that they would NOT FIX THE LCD SCREEN, but they would get the computer to start working again.  It has yet to be explained to me WHY the COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING IN THE 1st place.That was covered under warranty and my computer is now back 2 weeks later up and running.  I can put up with a thumb print I guess.  But words of advice NEVER EVER TOUCH YOUR LCD SCREEN.  IT IS VERY SENSATIVE.  AND SONY CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS TO BE THE WORST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE.  I probably spoke with about 20 people during this time and only one girl by the name of WENDY provided me any CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Although I do like this computer, I would not recommend it.  A computer should not stop working for no reason after 2 months and an LCD Screen should not leave an imprint after touching it.  The customer support is terrible.  If I had it to do all over again I would go back to a DELL which caused me no problems in the 4 years I had it.  It was just time to upgrade to a largeer, quicker, newer version.  The weight of this computer and style is what led me to this.  Really, its not worth it compared to the aggreviation that I have experienced and the lack of customer support.","Date":"February 14, 2004"}
{"Title":"Small, light and just right!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RZV68XVOT7ETM","Overall":"good","Content":"There are some really great things about this laptop. First, the weight (or lack of it). It is light and easy to carry in a bag, which will be a relief if you are replacing a nearly 10 pound laptop like me. The old dinosaur was doing well if it got 70 minutes from a battery. The V505DX gets almost 4 HOURS for basic word processing and surfing (closer to 2 and change if you're watching a DVD).I had read the complaints and had to buy my unit sight unseen, but I am very happy. I had heard bad things about the keyboard. They are, for the most part, not true. Yes, it is a smaller keyboard. Yes, the right shift key is small, but you can get used to it by using it for a couple of hours. The screen looks good and is a 12 incher, but you get the savings in weight.You will find when you get this laptop that it comes with no discs for the OS or bundled software. This is because Sony has partitioned to the drive so that the application software is in one place if it needs to be reloaded. In theory, all your data should be on the second partition (D drive), so if anything ever happens, you can restore your machine to functionality while saving your data. I moaned about this at first, but I know see the advantages of it. What it really means is that you are not going to be able to do a clean install of XP Pro and you are not going to be able to take the partition off the drive without risking losing the ability to restore your laptop should something go wrong.You do have to create your own recovery discs (9 of them!) or order a DVD recovery disc from Sony for about 15 bucks. If you are like me and like to format your laptop as soon as you get it, you will need to know that you aren't going to be able to do this (at least easily) with this one.I do wish the warranty was longer than a year, but every other laptop I have looked at seems to have the same.Love this baby!","Date":"February 4, 2004"}

{"Title":"An excellent choice for music and media on the go!","Author":"Kyle Felker \"Technologist, reader\"","ReviewID":"R2GTG3D46I9CJR","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the 505dx after looking long and hard at the TR series, and ended up buying it because it had much the same features at a slightly lower price.  So far, I'm glad I did.  The 505dv is packed with memory (comes with 512, can be upgraded to 2 gigs) and a very fast processor for a computer this small (1.4 mhz pentium M).  As someone else has noted, the video card has its own memory.  The 505Dx really seems to be targeted at people who want to do digital video or media, hence the extremely large hard drive, relatively souped-up video card, and relatively large amount of memory capacity.  It also comes with a large amount of media software preinstalled.  Oddly, this model does not seem to have a DVD-writable drive available as an option.The laptop itself is just under five pounds, and the casing seems strong and durable.  It offers two USB 2.0 ports, which, trust me, you will appreciate when using peripheral devices.  Other perks include built-in wireless networking and a memory stick slot.Now the downside-the laptop does not have a very large range of available features-you can choose XP pro or home, 40-80GB hard drive, and more memory, but not much else is optional.  This is common failing of laptops in general.  As with most small laptops, the optical drive is built-in and can't be swapped out.  The keyboard and mouse are hard to use and the mousepad in particular is not very sensitive (another common failing of laptops in general).  The sound from the speakers is crappy, but laptop speakers always sound crappy.  Get some external speakers or headphones.Also, note that sony skimps on its warranties-mine came with only a one-year limited warranty for parts and service and 90-day free technical support.  Sony really needs to take a lesson from Dell and offer greater warranty coverage, especially for laptops, which tend to be more fragile and abused.In all, I think this computer is a great value for the money, particularly if you want something small and powerful with which to do music downloading and sharing.","Date":"February 2, 2004"}

(Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.) I hadn't used a Mac in years, but I decided I'd had it with Microsoft and Windows. All it took was one weekend and a good book - \"Mac OS X: The Missing Manual,\" by David Pogue -however, and I mastered the machine.SOFTWAREThe computer comes with some great software. iTunes is the best media player on the market. I have almost 5,000 songs stored on mine. With the search function and browser display, it is easy to find a particular song. iTunes also keeps track of the number of times you've listened to a song and it allows you to rate your songs. It's easy to create a playlist. Also, burning one of those playlists onto a CD can be done with one click.Safari is a great web browser. It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I've never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don't allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven't mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software.

They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I've spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications. No idea why the hard drive went. Hence I dropped the rating from five stars to four.","Date":"December 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"Great little laptop","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3HAMKAXA5R30Z","Overall":"good","Content":"Finally retired my Sony Vaio (850Mhz) and made the switch to a powerbook--wanted to do that ever since I realized that Mac OS X is pretty much BSD Unix with a killer desktop.  What a great machine this is. Much better than the comparable IBook...twice the processor cache for starters...and none of the problems that have plagued the 1Gz iBook.  Weighs just 4.6 pounds and is very portable...aluminium case is very scratch resistant.  I get GREAT range with the add-on Airport Extreme card going to a LinkSys 11g access point (there's an antenna in the lid of the unit).  I'm very happy with the battery life, the operating system, and the apps I use on this machine (Office X mostly).  About a month after getting and using this machine I got a G5 for my desktop and I'm quite happy.  If you're looking for a gaming rig, forget Apple but if you're looking for a business-oriented machine that fits in very smoothly with a PC-based office, this is the ticket. Networks much easier than a Windows machine!","Date":"March 3, 2004"}

The build quality is excellent and the aluminum casing exudes class. Compared to the first 12-inch PowerBook, it runs cooler and is quite a bit snappier. Plus it supports DVI out and USB 2.That said, its battery life and Airport range are not quite as good as an iBook's. So unless you're going to do a lot of serious video/graphics work, you may want to consider one of the new G4 iBooks -- they're great machines for the price.Really, you can't go wrong either way, depending on your needs.","Date":"November 2, 2003"}

I had a 15\" TI and experienced most of the normal complaints one reads about in the various message boards (heat, bad paint). Given the vast differences between M$ products and the way the Apple performed, my sanity said go for it!To sum up. The aluminum case, the size, the reliability make it worth it. It's a head turner. I get lots of comments in Starbucks when I check e-mails and do some work. My only advice would be to invest in a good case. The latch is flimsy and probably will fail if you carry the Pbook around naked a lot. The Airport Extreme card is a worthwhile accessory, too. So many places have 802.11 access these days. There are also after market car and airline chargers available which will effectively allow you to work from the time you leave your office and fly to a far off destination. Battery life is good so far. From talking to other owners and personal experience, I recommend going with the manual recomendations. I consistently get between two and three hours depending on what I am doing. I would expect two years of usage from this notebook. By that time, Jobs and Company will have something faster and better that you won't be able to live without.","Date":"January 11, 2004"}

I bought the 12\" Powerbook G4 1Ghz, and have been blown away by it. It has a good metallic design and its size is very easy to carry around, this is the major disadvantage of larger bulkier notebooks. I have had mine upgraded to 1.25 GB Ram, and the performance of applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop is great. You can even play games like Halo on it pretty well, if that is your thing. You can have up to 80GB of HD, and my advice is to buy the largest you can afford. I also have an Airport (802.11g) card installed, and it allows wireless connectivity with a pretty good range. In addition, Bluetooth built-in allowed me to use a very nice wireless mouse with it.  The Keyboard is of good quality, an important feature if you have to write long documents in Word! The LCD screen is of good quality too.

{"Title":"Great machine, few flaws","Author":"Robert Graves","ReviewID":"R3KQMKBQPZ1W5F","Overall":"good","Content":"Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.","Date":"February 18, 2004"}

A notebook or laptop it is not; its big and heavy by todays standards but the performance is fantastic!The Gateway desktop died (will never buy from them again) and couldn't be brought back to life so I decided to pick up a \"notebook\".  The FRV37 is blazing fast, the screen is large, bright and clear & its got plenty of HD space (if you need more consider getting an external USB hard drive).  With a CD and a DVD burner you really don't need a desktop machine anymore.  It comes with a nice software bundle.  Its got firewire built in and is great for capturing video from digital video cameras.  If you go on vacation, take this computer, a Sony or Canon Digitial video cam and an Olympus digital camera and everyone on the trip can go home with CDs or DVDs of the trip.Buy this machine if you want to replace your desktop, you don't need long bettery life (it gets about 2 hours max), and you want something portable but not light weight.  The only thing missing is built in wireless but for about $50.00 you can get a wireless card that will do the trick.

I'm not about to sit down w/ 10+ cd-r's to do this.  They give you lots of software, but nothing that great.  I had been using an old version of Quicken.  The Quicken 2003 that came with it would not let me import the info w/o buying the upgraded version.All in all it's a good package though.  the documentation that comes in the box is more ad's for sony products than actual info on your $1600 investment.

I took off one star because it doesn't have built in wireless. I chose this machine because it had the best display of the machines I looked at under $1500.00 (I paid $ 1350.00) at Circuit City. The keyboard and display are both very nice. The sound is not great but it was better than two Toshiba machines I was looking at. It has USB 2.0 and Firewire. It also has an ATI Radeon chip with 64mb of shared RAM. I was able to make restore disks using two DVD-R and one CD-R with no trouble and free up the restore partition on the hard drive. I benchmarked my machine using SiSoft Sandra 2003 and came up with performance expected of a 2.8 Ghz Pentium 4. I should point out that I am technically experienced. I had my own business repairing and upgrading computers. Maybe the process of creating the restore disks is more challenging for others.

I have never wanted for processing speed, and i can take the thing around places, so my basic needs are satisfied.The problems:A) low battery life.  My battery life is now about 20 minutes.  When i got it, the life was ~1.5 hours.  I'm guessing that this is what happens when you overcharge a battery constantly by having the laptop plugged in all the time.  Apple has solved this problem, why can't sony?B) heavy.  and the ac adapter is HUGE, about the size of a psp/1st gen. gameboy.  Will fit in backpack, but it will weigh you down.  It's fine to carry - so long as its the only thing you're carrying.C) hot.  i highly recommend a centrino processor.  p4s are just too hot for a laptop.

It is no longer lacking in the processor department and thus is a very \"well-rounded\" laptop.As for the machine itself, it's great. The entire laptop is white, crisp white (a mixed blessing...it's elegant, but very, very hard not to dirty it), and the overall design is great. Everything is ergonomical and compact: the little latch to close the iBook stays hidden on the top, but then magically appears as you close it. (Gotta love Apple's design team for those little things!) The keyboard, unlike other models, isn't \"spongy.\"In fact, it is rather sturdy for a laptop keyboard. It is stationed to a strong metal backboard and if you take the keyboard and backboard off, you will see a slot for an Airport Extreme card (card that enables wireless internet). No more PC \"NIT\" cards protruding from the sides, everything is on the inside. The top of the computer has a translucent Apple logo that glows when you are computing in the dark. The trackpad is large and precise, and the button (Windows users, beware: no \"Left-clicking\" in the Mac world, only \"Command clicking\"!) is large and responsive.Battery life is excellent, I get an average of 5 hours with normal use. The charger has a light indicating the level of charge so you know when the 'book is charged (green for charged, amber for charging) without turning it on or waking it from its \"Sleep\" mode. Panther, the latest version of Mac OS X (10.3), is stunning, powerful, and reliable in its own right (go ahead and check out those reviews or Jaguar's reviews, the previous OS X version.) I don't want to go into the benefits of its UNIX core, just trust me that it is stable. The \"iLife\" set of software is one that really revolutionized the Apple world, after OS X, software-wise. It's all here: iTunes (store, burn, and buy music in one easy-to-use program), iPhoto (organize, burn, share, print, edit, email, and more with a plug-and-play friendly piece of software), iMovie (for editing, storing, and organizing your DV movies), but no iDVD...no DVD burner (but you can buy an external one.) Some other good programs that supplement your iLife are Mail, Appleworks, iChat, iCal, etc. It comes with World Book 2003, Quicken, and a few others.It's fast. CD's burn with one click. My iPod (a great addition to this for music lovers) loads with one slide of a Firewire cable (literally.) Safari has built-in pop-up control (never has a single pop-up existed here.) Games (only the Sims so far) load and play flawlessly. DVD watching is pristine. USB 2.0 and Firewire (a BIG plus for external hard drives) work at top speed. No bugs, no crashes, no viruses. This machine was engineered to have the software and hardware be integrated. Have a problem? You won't be told to call a different company. You will always have one number to call, and they can't transfer you (since they make the hardware and software)What more is there to say? I love my iBook! It's light, user friendly, and works like a dream. Quick! Go order one. You'll be in for a treat.","Date":"January 9, 2004"}

It has very clear sound for iTunes or games or anything. Speaking of games: Because it has a very strong processor (G4 933 MHz) games run like heaven on it. Currebntly I have Call of Duty on it, a rather strong game, and it delvers the perfect experiance Mac gamers want. The iBook G4 aslo comes with for no charge at all Tony Hawk's Proskater 4 and Deimos Rising. Back to applications: Th iBook G4 has great applicatons such as iTunes, Safari, Internet Explorer, iChat, AppleWorks 6, iCal, iPhoto, iMovie,and more!  This computer also has very long battery life. Around 4 or 5 hours! As for design, wonderful. It has a great screen, and great keyboard (in fact one of the best laptop keyboards I have used). And I like it's color. It's just a simple good looking white. There you have it, the great and almighty iBook G4. Trust me, worth it's money.","Date":"June 20, 2004"}
{"Title":"True Love At Last","Author":"Carolina Kipnis","ReviewID":"R39451D3N90HDB","Overall":"good","Content":"This little beauty came into my life around Christmas, and she and I have been inseparable since then.  I ordered it directly from the Apple Store Online, and I had it maxed out on RAM, and had the optional 60G hard drive installed.  I love the processor speed, immense capability, and versatility.  The screen size makes it a suitable replacement for a desktop computer.I do everything on this computer: word-processing, spreadsheets, music transcription, photo editing, Internet communications, audio editing, and managing my music collection.  I have Office X, Sibelius, and  iLife 2004. I run iTunes in the background, write a report integrating Excel and Word, plus can have all my pictures handy on iPhoto.  I can have five or six applications running at the same time (not including iChat and MSN Messenger, which are ALWAYS running), and the processor doesn't even hiccup.  I use an iPod 40G as an external hard drive (not to mention all dem kewl tunes!), and have a Canon PowerShot A80 digital camera, and an iMic audio converter.  Add to that an AirPort driven wireless network and a laser printer, and you have an ultra-powerful home office for any kind of occupation, from music composition, culinary research, to communications-based businesses.Although larger and heavier than the 12\" iBook, I believe the 14\" screen is definitely worth the extra weight and price.  If you get it, the wireless card (AirPort Extreme) is a must.  The optional built-in Bluetooth module is nice, especially if you have a compatible PDA or cell phone.I didn't realize I would love owning a laptop.  Until I met this one.","Date":"February 23, 2004"}
{"Title":"14.1\" iBook by Apple","Author":"Brian","ReviewID":"RY5MB4WJMJXB2","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, let me say that I paid the 1500 dollars in September, before they changed all the iBooks to G4s and the USB ports to 2.0 .  Why is this important?  Well, a few reasons.  Final Cut Pro only works on G4s.  I paid 699 dollars for the upgrade that my computer could certainly handle, however the software was designed to look for a G4 or G5 in order for installing.  So, as that wouldn't have been too aggrivating until I tried to take it back to CompUSA which I soon found out has a zip-O-la return policy, I got a bit peeved at both CompUSA and Apple Software design.  Well, within two months of my purchase the 'new' G4 iBooks were on the net to buy, and I had my answer on Apples ideas for makeing a touch more money by getting me to buy a new laptop, if I want to run something like.. oh Final Cut Pro, or some animation software on the market.However, the reason I put five stars wasn't Apple's beautiful software marketing and design, or CompUSAs ability to move a person to consider programming a video game thats objective is strangling CompUSA employees.The real reason is that for laptops, and for this price, it is a quality laptop.  You see, I can't justify to myself paying over 1500 of a base price for a tool that I'm going to be using out of my home.  At any moment it could be stolen and I am much more at peace with a loss of 1500 dollars for a top of the line iBook which can be much more readily replaced than 3000 dollars for a top of the line PowerBook.My laptop has survived a 2 ft plus drop while open from a bed to a not so plush carpeted floor.  There wasn't too much destruction done other than some of the lineing on the left edge of the screen and the battery doesn't fit as smoothly as before.  Everything still works, including all the ports I use, like the USB, firewire, 56K Modem, and the Adapter port.  It works fine on battery and plugged in, so I really didn't lose any functionality.The laptop operating system doesn't break down, although it does freeze every once in a while.  The software that it comes with is very useful, and handy, and not as annoying as say, windows media player..  The text editing software that it comes with is ahhhhh!!!ggrrr.. when you try to program html initially.. fortunately, after going to the preferences you can fix this loading html pages as a web browser does initial setting.  iTunes is fun, and useful, and the only drawback is that it doesn't read the song encoding on CDs that Windows Media Player does.  So you have to either manually type the name of the song in by hand, or buy your songs off the internet at a buck a piece.  The iPhoto works fine and allows for some adjustment, but if you're into adjusting your photos, use nothing less than Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  Photoshop might well be a waste of 600 plus dollars if you get good at Elements 2.0 .  In fact.. I'd dare say Adobe Illustrator and Elements 2.0 could be a grand combo.  Safari is a good browser with annoyances with interpreting java on the web.  No joke, web browsers that understand Java well on the web on macs are rare as leopard seals.  There is only two of them.  One is the Microsoft Internet Explorer(who stopped making new IEs for mac because Safari does everything it does) and the other is Safari.  Every other web browser.. say.. mozilla??  like Netscape 7.01, Firebird .7 and Mozilla and Camino seem to all be carbonized.  And the problem?  Well, for some reason, carbonizing does not like Java or something.  No Java, no chatting, or java online gaming.  So the only chatting you can do say on Yahoo is on Safari and IE.  No problem, they are both free.  And Safari is included with all the new macs.  But for your daily web browsing, you might want to download Firebird .7 .  After you get the tab browsing down and the various keyboard commands, you will find its just the best daily browser out there.  It runs secure bank transactions in xml fine and quickly.  As a bonus AppleWorks comes with every new iBook, so you definitely have a decent word processor.  But don't be fooled with the Microsoft Office that seems to be included, Microsoft wouldn't forgoe a profit that easily.  The Microsoft Office on the computer is a 30 day trial.  Office X is 500 dollars.  Not too much for full licensing for a single user.  And well worth it if you're in college or otherwise use it frequently.  Look at QuarkXPress for some serious pricing.. oww.  The clock is nifty and calendar is useful, and the internet options are easily read in the upper menu bar.  And for entertainment, you can talk to the computer and it will do what you say.. if you can speak it well enough for the computer.. you know.. the standard speech recognition flaw.  The fun thing about all this is that you talk to the chess game and play an entire chess game by speaking alone.  It's actually pretty nifty.There is enough computer software out there for the mac, especially if you want to get work done and you work with video or images.  The Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2 don't save files quite the same way which can be a touch annoying if you are using old macs at school still.  You have to specify the exact program to open this or that file between the two operating systems.  This is easy enough.. as long as its only a file or two, come ten or so, and it gets a bit annoying.  On the good end, it is more compatable with pcs now.  There is a decent software translation of Windows XP for purchase for ultimate compatability.  Wasn't too bad, but as always.. anything Microsoft runs as slow as a slug.  Try a G5 if you want to run the Windows XP translation a lot.  If Windows XP freezes, it doesn't freeze OS X, and thats kinda nice.  Adobe has most of there popular software available on the mac, and so does Macromedia.  And Living Language has their 9.0 versions of Language Lessons in plenty of European and Asian languages available on Mac.  Also, if your into Video, Adobe dropped Premiere because Final Cut Pro was kicking their but in earning the market share.  And if your into animation software, Cinema 4D 8.5v and Maya 5 both support mac, as well as Lightwave.  So as far as getting something done, the mac is awesome.. it doesn't freeze much if you treat it decent(don't run a zillion programs at once).  It simply works, and has better compatability than Linux.  Although Linux rocks too, Mac OS X is a Unix base with more compatability.  It is simply more compatable with stability than Linux.  Microsoft Windows?  Well, its compatable with a bonus of being hacked and virus wrecked and blue screened every so often.  In other words... Microsoft Windows tends to limit me getting anything done.. particularly in Graphics Design degree which of course is only macs.As far as games, of course most of the games out there are made for windows.  On the other hand, many might argue that if you are a real gamer, you own an XBox or a PS2 already.  Besides, Microsoft XP is available for Mac.  Like I said, get a G5 for that kind of thing.The chatting programs?  Well, Windows Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and AOL instant messenger, as well as the OS X customized iChat version of AOL instant messenger that comes with any new mac.  The Yahoo Messenger can't do as much as it can on Windows.. on the other hand.. it doesn't get hacked like the one on Windows, which doesn't freeze my computer, which makes my life a bit easier.If you're into video, you should remember two things.. one, VCD format.  You know, that old laser disk format that any CD burner can place on a CD-R/RW.  two.. if your into business cards, the business card CD-Rs can hold video flash presentations as well.  So, basically, if your not looking for 2 hour movies on a dvd, you can easily burn animations as well as edit them from the CD-Rs on the iBooks.  The other detail is that 400 firewire is the only thing sold on iBooks.  800 firewire is considered 'professional'.  However, although my 400 dollar Olympus digital camera can make short videos, it, like many Digital Cameras on the market, does not have firewire.  In fact, that is much more likely to be restricted to digital camcorders.  Such as my Digital Camcorder does have.  Still, you still have to look for a firewire port, not all camcorders have them.Hopefully, you found my review helpful.  Oh, one more helpful hint.  Certain Epson scanners come with Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  A good piece of software with a needed accessory.  I definitely recommend it.  ArcSoftware is the usual accessory.  Don't be fooled.. although its fun and useful, for work with multiple photos, nothing beats Elements 2.0 .Hope you all enjoy this laptop if you buy it.  Obviously every business is out to make money and Apple is no different.  But Apple OS X and Apple laptops as a combo are better and more useful than nearly anything with Windows on it.Brian","Date":"December 17, 2003"}

It worked beautifully in the first few days. Then it would not start up at all. My wife called Apple tech supports. After few questions, the lady realized my wife was not quite knowledgeable in the iBook and required some hand holding to debug the problem. She hanged up on her. I would never expect Apple support people would do that at all!The 2nd tech support was much more helpful. After running some tests, he decided the hard disk was not working and asked my wife to bring it to a nearby Best Buy for repairing. Best Buy asked us to pay for the shipping fee. We then called the tech support again. We were asked to bring it to a nearby Apple store so we don't need to pay for the shipping fee due to it's within 90 days of the purchase.It looks like the tech supports were more interested in whether we wanted to buy their Apple Care than fixing our problem. I always have very high opinions on Apple products until now.Later on I found out Apple.com has lots of informaiton regarding iBook problems and how to fix them. I was able to fix the start up problem after I have tried several instructions at Apple.com. But the computer failed again with the same problem the very next day!

This, my friends, is a F$#@ing Thinkpad. This guy eats 5 dozen eggs for breakfast. He can lift up a bench with three buxom lasses on it. He uses antlers in all of his decorating. Get the picture? Good.He is HEAVY and HUGE and I have named mine Moose.Now, granted, this is not a guy you can watch movies on, or play games on. This is definitely a computer for writing and surfing the web and basics like that. He CAN stream pandora or another music service, but tends to skip sometimes if you're doing anything else. He has a bit of trouble with flash-heavy webpages, but a good flashblocker add-on can help him with that. Budget your programs with him, don't ask him to do too much. I usually limit myself to a chat program (and I use Trillian 3.1 and AIM 5.9), Word, and Chrome. Definitely use the most streamlined versions of things on this guy, and he'll do you fine.Of course, there is the little matter of you being able to add space, speed, and so on with him. Thinkpads are probably the best kind of machine for upgrading. He's got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I'm sure does SOMETHING but I don't know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they're loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark. There are also page forward and page back buttons on either side of the up key.I would say that if you're a writer in need of a laptop that'll survive the long haul, or if you're someone who appreciates a machine that will last you years instead of months, get this. Ffs there's a review in here from someone who's had their machine for five years!This guy won't steer you wrong, people.","Date":"October 18, 2012"}

{"Title":"IBM/Lenovo = The Finest Laptops Available","Author":"Richard Odato \"Slingboxer\"","ReviewID":"R2LPQKH83PFYDQ","Overall":"good","Content":"We purchased two T-41 laptops back in 2003.  Prior to that, we had a Dell - (TERRIBLE) computer, and a Toshiba - (bad) computer.  Our T-41s are still running fine.The T-41's are far superior in reliability.  IBM tech support is also far superior to Toshiba's and (especially) Dell's which was incredibly horrible.T-41's have arguably the best keyboard of any laptop ever.  They are sturdy, lightweight and travel well.  The performance is good - even compared to more modern machines.  We upgraded the hard drive capacity and after installing more memory, the speed increased dramatically.  With added memory, they even run Windoze 7 just fine. Try to get one with the 9,000 series video card.  They have much greater graphics resolution.Our brand-new T-41's cost about $1,400 each back in 2003.  Over the years, the T-41 line has become far less expensive on the used/refurb laptop market.  These computers were built for the corporate market and many of them were leased and returned for refurb.  You can buy one now for about $75-175 used.  That's quite a bargain.  As a result, we bought a few spare identical computers and if we have any problems with one, I just swap the hard drives and I'm back in business in 10 minutes.  That system works very well for us.We wish IBM were still making laptops instead of Lenovo, but it seems as though Lenovo is still maintaining good quality in their new machines.  Tech support is still provided by IBM, and as previously stated, it is truly outstanding and provided by English speaking Americans in Atlanta.","Date":"October 20, 2013"}
{"Title":"The worst five pound slab of junk you could ever buy and hopefully never rely upon.","Author":"Anonymous \"Anonymous\"","ReviewID":"R1Q4BGUSEYTK6J","Overall":"bad","Content":"Too bad that IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad's have really slid downhill, they break down just for the sport of it, there is growing number of web sites and complainants reporting a growing number of bizarre problems espeically with these older models and the new ThinkPads are getting worse while Lenovo keeps mortgaging their old reputation to command higher prices.The T41-T43's have a particularly stupid vulnerability, the motherboards can permanently fry from inserting a USB device !Hard to believe, but is a known problem (link to the community WiKi in the first comment) and the fix is even stranger if you don't want to keep buying new motherboards, you take a heat gun and \"reflow the motherboard\" after covering most of it aluminum foil.Buying new or used replacement parts for any ThinkPad is just as bad as shopping for antique Porsche parts because the tight knit community overcharges for everything. Thinkpads seem to kill batteries faster than the Arizona summer because I've never managed to get two years out of ThinkPad battery before it reports failures. The fans are noisier than hell and growl worse than horny house cats in the middle of April and those go bad requiring expensive replacements.It's too bad, ThinkPad's used to have legendary quality, they were the only laptops allowed on the International Space Station, IBM made the first tablet computer in the 1990's, these used to be innovators but now they're just the wallet invaders and for most new customers, their first ThinkPad decidedly becomes their last ThinkPad never willing to reconsider the headaches and hassles again.The ThinkPad community is literally guarded by miscreant owners too embarrassed to admit they made a mistake and eager to attack any critic and I expect to see this review attacked and buried in negative votes, that certainty underscores my assertions.Review the immediate comment since Amazon allows external links in comments for the authoritative ThinkPad sites that sheepishly admit just defective these things have become.","Date":"March 9, 2013"}

{"Title":"Only for the Simple","Author":"Cooking Mama","ReviewID":"RS8XVH8LXS0OH","Overall":"good","Content":"tl;dr Get this laptop for simple tasks like word processing or checking e-mail. Not best for entertainment purposes like watching dvds, gaming, and Skype calling.Clearly this is a cheap laptop and it's cheap for a reason. This laptop was manufactured by IBM who are famous for their Lenovo technology. Lenovo is a fairly good brand, so that's a plus.Pros: + price: It costed $130 used. + keyboard: I freakin' love typing on this thing. It has a nice feel. Don't judge me.Cons: - slow: It has a 1.6 GHz processor. What do you expect. It takes a while to start up and is kind of slow switching between tabs in Google Chrome depending on the level of content on a page and the number of tabs you have up. - clunky: This thing weighs about 11 pounds. The design is old looking & clunky. if you feel embarrassed using a dinosaur-looking machine, either don't use it in public or don't buy it. Haha.I got this laptop because I just needed a device to type my papers for my silly ENC1102 class. The reason why I got a laptop instead of a netbook was because of price and the laptop had a more comfortable viewing & typing size. I occasionally roam around Youtube, but its speed is fine. It may be a bit laggy at times if you're watching a DVD.Overall, this is a decent laptop for simple computing. Works best for word processing... anything productive. It fits all my needs for school.

{"Title":"Works Splendidly.","Author":"Gary Peterson","ReviewID":"R1JZBONCJ3FTX0","Overall":"good","Content":"I have an iMac in my office and I like it very much. So, when it came time for buying a home computer, I got the same iMac, but got the version with the larger screen and more memory at the advice of my wife. Well, we've blown two hard drives on the home iMac (covered under warranty, except for the lost files) and I'm rather annoyed. Nevertheless, I really like it as a computer. Alas, my wife likes it too and she's constantly working on eBay things. Too much so, in my opinion. I've been constantly on her for working at the computer all the time and blocking my usage. As a solution, she gave me an iBook G4 for Christmas (1907).I really like this little iBook. It's been completely trouble free, and in that respect is better than either of my iMacs. It's fast and my enjoyment of working on it greatly increased after I purchased a Mighty Mouse to go with it. I'm a college professor and I give about 12 classroom lectures per week. I also give visiting lectures (about 2 per month) all over Southern California. I store my PowerPoint presentations in the computer and it works out very well. I simply walk into a classroom or hall, plug in the equipment and I'm ready to go. Everything works real well, as long as I'm the one setting it up. When others have set it up, I've had a couple problems which they then blame on Apple equipment. There's an \"Apple Phobia\" that's widely prevelant. That's nonsense. It's their own ineptitude that's the problem. This is a real nifty computer and works splendidly for my purposes.Gary Peterson","Date":"February 4, 2009"}

One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review.

Windows XP will always be BETTER than all other operating systems. Yeah I said it! From my experience with the more advanced windows such as windows 7/Vista they have always been too faulty with all sorts of random errors: Slow starting up, Trouble/Slow connecting, freezing, blank outs screens, the list just goes on & on. So random, Its annoying. I find that they over-do it with the more advanced systems, I really don't think most laptops are designed to handle all that. I much prefer this in Windows XP(Pro)! I find its more concrete, more sturdy, & I can turn them on with no surprises waiting for me. I have had very few troubles with it so far: Its fast, large screen, nice to look at, reliable, easy to customize. It even connected to my wireless internet right away & with no prompt. The battery life is decent as well though I always keep it plugged anyway. The only problem is this tea kettle whistling noise the battery occasionally makes when plugged but I hardly notice it most of the time. This is a win win for me in terms of price & quality esp since I find this better than any of the more expensive brands. What a Steal. Ofcourse the RAM, Free space & Memory is pretty small but that doesn't matter for me since I don't plan on downloading or saving much of anything at all. I'm sure I'll have to be very careful with this thing. I just hope the computer never crashes on me, that's my only concern.  But good so far. Highly Recommended it. :)","Date":"January 12, 2012"}

Now, if you're looking for something sleek and futuristic this laptop is not for you, but if you want to listen to music, stream videos, do some word-processing and browse the web this computer is perfect. The wireless also works great. I can't believe it was under $200. It was worth every penny. I bought this when my HP laptop crapped out. It was a little over three years old. I can't afford a new computer right now and needed something just for those basic functions I listed above. The computer's old so the battery doesn't really hold a charge. It's also not the lightest so I don't leave home with it very often. It runs Windows XP, so you can't install some recent and complicated software (ex. I couldn't install the software for my Zune mp3 player, but I had no problem with Spotify). These are the only minor complaints that I have. The only thing that I wish it had is a webcam, but that's not a big deal. I don't really Skype that much anyway. This laptop gives you more than enough bang for your buck.

It's running great, surfs the net with good speed, boots up pretty quickly. The only thing that seems a little lacking is the battery life. I usually have it plugged in anyway so it's not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life. Not terrible but not great.

I got mine from U.S. Micro and couldn't get the wifi working. An email from their tech support stated that they check their machines for wifi card being installed before they ship, but sometimes they forget. I got one without the wifi circuit card, and they promptly replaced the laptop with another that did. Just remember, Amazon's T43 web page indicates wifi as being a built-in feature, but it is NOT. You need to check with the seller before you buy. Also need to make sure it comes with the correct driver installed, otherwise you'll need another computer to download it. (note: according to U.S. Micro, there are two possible wifi cards, the IBM and the Intel. You need to install the correct driver for your particular wifi circuit card)Who knows what else might be listed as a standard feature, but isn't really? I can't tell yet; everything else seems to work okay so far on my machine. The T43 can come in various configurations, and it comes in two different screen sizes (14.1 inch and 15 inch).This laptop gets pretty hot after 30 minutes or so.Two USB ports is a little skimpy for some people. Consider a USB hub, or the T60/T61 which has three USB ports. Other than USB, has oodles of I/O ports, even a good old-fashioned IrDA for hotsyncing my Clie and Handera PDAs.Otherwise, this is a reliable and solidly built computer. Good performance even being some 7 years old. A champ!

The one odd thing that caught my attention had to do with one software program that was installed, which I had not expected to be installed: PowerPoint. I was glad to have it, but there were a few fragments of old PowerPoint presentations still on the machine, from some business that had owned the computer before. It wasn't much, but usually refurbished computers won't have anyone's old data at all. Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow.

{"Title":"Dependable system, nightmare company","Author":"J. Leary \"jleary\"","ReviewID":"R3GBNEZJXDH3EY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned a Gateway M305CRV for nearly 4 years.  The processor is a 2.4GHz mobile celeron and I installed 1GB of Ram (system max).  I also upgraded the hard drive to 100GB, which the system handles with no issues.Despite the fact that the processor is the older single core vs. the newer dual core intel and AMD models, the performance is still comparable.  I use the sytem for surfing the web, e-mail, photo editing, some video editing, and standard word and spreadsheet processing.  I have also used it periodically for database development in Access.While you cannot use the more demanding programs (such as Access or photoshop elements) simultaneously without bogging the system down somewhat, the performance is still on par with newer processors for working in a single application.  I have owned several different models of the Gateway laptops and Dell laptops, and I find in general that the Gateway models seem more efficient that the Dells. The downside of the Gateway's is the customer service.  If you don't need tech support and can do your own upgrades for most items you would want to change (such as RAM, hard drive, optical drive, etc.) don't be afraid of a Gateway.","Date":"March 18, 2008"}

For starters, I needed something cheap (~$750, as I recall) that could primarily perform basic tasks.  No probs there.  And no others for the last 8 years, with the exception that the battery did die on my a few years ago.  That's a bummer, but, I think, a common problem not limited to Gateway.Now, the power connection or the AC adapter itself is having problems and sometimes it goes on an extended jag of giving me pop up msgs that I need to reconnect the AC because the battery is about dead.  Also, one of the keyboard letters got stuck at a weird angle and I popped it off trying to fix it.  That'll never go back on.  Along with everything else, screen technology has improved greatly so my screen looks pretty  dull compared to newer machines.Still, we are talking about a very old laptop, here.

I decided on the 15 inch model and I'm very happy that I did.  The screen size is perfect for extended periods of use while programming.  The free software on the Mac store called xCode is a great application.I've used PCs all of my life and the Mac OS is head over heels better than all of the Windows OS versions.  Although, Windows 7 is a much closer competitor.Parallels Desktop 7 allows you to run Windows 7 on your Mac also, this adds the best of both worlds.  Mac's killer OS and Windows' programs.Pros:Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!!  I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.It is extremely fast.The screen size is perfect.The Mac App Store is great.The keypad is backlit.Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.The battery life is good.Cons:It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn't get proper ventilation.Glossy screen, but for me it isn't that bad.The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.  It also adds so many things you can do in the way of note taking, applications that help you brainstorm for writing papers.  It has been a big help with my 5 page essays.I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes to program because the screen size is perfect for extended periods of use.  This is a great computer.  It would be even better if you have an iPad or iPhone.  If you have either of those than I would strongly suggest you get a Macbook because of the application compatibility.  This is a great computer and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  The heat only happens if you have it suffocated by your lap.  This is a great computer and you should definitely get it for college, or any other work related things.","Date":"September 26, 2011"}

{"Title":"Is there anything else to say?","Author":"Michael Simpson","ReviewID":"R2HVBICM0XLPWD","Overall":"good","Content":"This is one of the best laptops on the market.  The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.The good* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.Not so good* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.* The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5\" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one.","Date":"December 4, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great computer - SHIPS WITH LION","Author":"Scot Stafford","ReviewID":"R1Y3LINC8KN4XK","Overall":"good","Content":"I got the glossy model, base configuration and will upgrade through third parties.  Very satisfied so far.  Feels like the sturdiest, best designed laptop I've ever owned.My only complaint is that as of today (09/19/2011), Amazon's product description states that \"This Mac comes pre-installed with OS X Snow Leopard, but you can order a free upgrade to OS X Lion...\"  In fact, it ships with Lion pre-installed.  Dozens (if not hundreds) of major 3rd party applications have yet to announce compatibility with Lion, so this can be a significant issue for quite some time.  Amazon is not \"set up\" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it's still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I'll update this review as soon as it's published.","Date":"September 19, 2011"}
{"Title":"Upgraded from MBP 13","Author":"Art","ReviewID":"R9YIGDKO5ZW5","Overall":"good","Content":"The 13 inch MBP 2010 was my first mac and I thought it was the best laptop I ever used. Recently I got a special deal on the MBP 15 inch 2011 and decided to upgrade although the price of this thing is quite  high. Right away I busted this thing open, took out the DVD drive and installed a INTEL 120 GB SSD drive in it's place. Now I have 2 drives. The SSD is for OS X + software and the 500 GB spinning HD is for video since I use this to edit HD video H.265 filesAll I can say is that it made quite a difference after the switch from 13 inch. Running Premiere CS5.5 is much more spaced out and comfortable on the 15 inch. Much faster processor too.Internally the MBP 13 uses 1 fan and a small speaker attached to the main board. The 15 inch has 2 fans and 2 real speakers. There are other additions but you can look at apple's site yourself if you want to compare the models.With the SSD drive installed, my applications load instantly and everything is faster than a Macbook Air.Although I was loyal to Windows and PC all my life, I can now tell you that the average user would fall in love with OS X Lion compared to using Windows. Windows is sloppy, virus prone and doesn't operate smoothly with its hardware as Mac products do. I used many windows laptops and they all feel cheap and the trackpad always sucks no matter how expensive the unit is. Lots of people around me switched to Mac after playing with my laptop. A granny can learn to use a new mac in 1 hour while a PC might get tossed out the window.I know you've heard it before but I switched to Mac and don't plan on going back to PC.","Date":"August 14, 2011"}

{"Title":"It's Hard To Give A Complete Review Of A Notebook","Author":"Mister Murse","ReviewID":"R2IBXAWR86PKXL","Overall":"good","Content":"There are many different factors to consider when writing a review of a notebook, but I'm just going to go with the topics hardware and software.First, the exterior/hardware. This is the first thing that you see when unboxing so it only felt right to start here. Of course when you open it you're in the awe of actually owning an Apple machine. The aluminum unibody is extremely attractive, clean, and just stunning. Then more time sets in, and if you're like me, you begin to inspect it, wondering if it really is as perfect as you first thought it to be. Upon inspection of this machine (my 1st of two, BTW) I noticed there were some flaws. First, I noticed when the lid was closed, there was a gap on the right side (the drive side) compared to the left. Upon further inspection, eyeballing at an angle I find hard to describe, I can see an imperfection in the form of the aluminum, as if it was bent. Secondly, after some use, I also noticed two of the backlighting on the keys, keys 'B' and '7' were noticeably dimmer than their counterparts. Lastly, upon inspecting the powercord, it looks like there are some imperfections in the sheathing...I don't know from what or how, but just another thing to make my mind boggle. For a machine of this price and from a company like Apple where form and function are supposedly equal, I personally could not 'suck it up' and live with these things, but I'm sure there are those out there who would...to each is own. But other than those things, it definitely is a striking machine that leaves an impression.Second, the software. Being this is my first time owning an Apple and working with OS X, I have to say I am pleased right from the get go. It truly is simple to use. I don't know how else to explain it, but I've been using Windows for years, and after a short time, a couple weeks on a Mac, I feel quite oriented with it. Setting up things seem much less painful on a Mac, as the system often recognizes things in advance, ie setting up an internet connection. For the experienced, not impressive by any means, but for those who have trouble fathoming wireless anything, it works like it's supposed to without needing to be \"experienced.\" I'm sitting here trying to think of a more compelling example to share, but all I can really tell you is that things work in a straight forward way. Recalling my Windows experiences, there are often multiple sidesteps that would be taken to finally reach a certain destination, but here its a straight shot.Personal experience: As stated above, due to the hardware issues/imperfections, I bought a second MacBook Pro and returned the first one. I truly love my second one, as all the hardware imperfections are no longer there...the lid is even all the way around, the backlights work on all the keys, the power cord doesn't have any weird marks. I'm happy. I will say though, I don't know if Amazon was trying to be slick or if it's common practice, but the box this 2nd one came in I noticed had been opened before and a new clear piece of tape was placed over it. I'm not entirely sure what that means? I will also say too that the first one ran much cooler, as this one seems a bit warmer...(uh oh, did I make things worse for myself?) Not hot enough where I feel like I'm getting burned, but noticeably warmer...but I have read things about 'thermal paste' on these MBPs being excessively used, so I'm not sure...have to look further into that. But all in all, this is what I initially expected, form and function are top notch, as they should be to match the cost.MBP #1: 3 starsMBP #2: 4/4.5 stars (Would be 5 stars if it operated at the same cooler temperature as the first one)","Date":"July 2, 2011"}

The closest I got to a Mac was in school and I thought they were terrible.Back to 2011, I felt the need to buy a new laptop to replace my existing Windows 7 laptop (i wanted a sandy bridge and faster laptop). I was hesitant at first because of the ridiculous pricing but this macbook pro changed my mind entirely of my perception of macs.The laptop finishes booting up a few seconds quicker than my Acer laptop and the user interface was beautiful in its simplicity. This is the key word here folks: simplicity. Windows involve more menu clicking and finding compared to a Mac. Dont get me started on the screen, WOW! My eyes WILL get used to this when studying. In fact, it will make studying easier because the screen doesnt have dull areas like on my acer. Now the trackpad, it is the best trackpad I have used. You can move on the trackpad and click simultaneously without letting go of your finger. I like the chiclet keys plus the backlighting LED makes it look cool. The side speakers have incredible volume that I actually have to LOWER the volume because it was just too loud! My acer's volume fail in comparison but Acer's laptop have a smaller speaker.Overall:Apple Macbook Pro design is sophisticated, clean, and functional. I feel like a heavy burden has left my shoulder thanks to the nice trackpad, screen resolution and quality, and overall ease of use of Mac's OS X Lion.Apple has converted me from PC's!

I was also considering the 13\" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z. All of them are worthy laptops. I was attracted to the XPS as it is very well priced and a great looking laptop. But in the end I stuck with Mac. I have been a Mac user since about 2002. So, all my private software etc is Mac. Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac. So then had to decide on whether I go for the 13\" or not. I have always had the 13\" models. In the end I went for the 15\" because the sound is better and the sheer power of the laptop is brilliant. So much so that since getting this laptop I have retired my iMac i3, my son was very happy to inherit!In short then, you won't go wrong with this.

I've had this computer for about half a year now and it looks like it did when i first took it out of the box without any maintenance whatsoever.

I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon. I think 4GB of ram is more than enough for anyone, but I may upgrade to 8GB of ram in the future. Battery life is beyond what they claim if you turn down the obvious battery drainers. (Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon. Other than those things this laptop is FAST and durable, and will be even better when Mac OS X Lion comes out in a few days.So far this what I've bought for this laptop and recommend.-Rain Mstand-Logitech Anywhere mouse-Mini Display to HDMI for dual screening with TVs-Apple Wireless Keyboard-USB Hub (Sadly it only has 2 USB ports)-Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector (Strongly recommended if you want to keep it looking new)","Date":"July 9, 2011"}

I had sold my last Macbook (White polycarbonate) to go traveling and bought a Dell instead. It wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had. My Dell wasn't an entry level laptop it was actually the XPS M1330 with all the options. After upgrading to Win7 I thought my laptop was fast enough and the screen was bright and crisp. After breaking it I decided it was time to go back to a mac. I wasn't disappointed.This laptop can run laps around my Dell. Paired with a Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS-Bare Drive This laptop is faster than most $2300+ Windows computers and outperforms any windows pc in terms of start up/standby/resume/shutdown speed. I find that the graphics switching helps keep the laptop cool and the fan quiet under normal web browsing and document drafting. 3D drawings load quickly and you rarely find any lag while working on large 3D projects.I only carry the charger everywhere with me because I never know when I'm going to be spending extra time in the library or spending all day away from home. However I rarely find that I need to plug in during a normal day of classes and some study time inside the library. In case you need to fuel up between meetings and whatnot the battery charges to 80% fairly quickly.Usability is greatly improved over Windows machines with the extra large trackpad that conveniently doesn't get in the way while you're typing on the full size keyboard that is a joy to type on. I find that with the keys the way they're designed has me typing ~10 WPM more than other less intuitively designed keyboards. The backlight in the keys also help when you're on a plane or other dark places like certain lecture halls. It does however eat up more juice than I'd like.If your anticipating on doing more Graphics design or 3D drawing I would suggest upgrading to the Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop otherwise this will be more than plenty to satisfy the general user and student.

{"Title":"Replaced my 13 2010 MBP","Author":"A Techy Guy","ReviewID":"R1LL4PVFKDETRK","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me start off by saying I have always been a pc guy until I purchased my 2010 macbook pro 13' last year and I must say I don't know why I waited so long! I purchased my 13 back in September and about 6 months later I saw the new MacBook pros came out and comparing the specs I felt like I needed to upgrade. I replaced my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 with this and I must say that I am very pleased. The dual core on the 2010 seemed fast but when compared to the i7 quad core the dual core isn't even in the same universe! The 15' is super fast and great at handling multiple apps at once. The new Lion OSX is excellent and apple has added  a lot of things to make this os superb to others. The only drawback is that Apple has axed rosetta which means power pc run applications and games are no longer supported. However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs). The battery life on this laptop is great. I can usually get 6 to 8 hours of life from a single charge depending on what I am doing. Most laptops can only get 3 or 4 max. The battery can actually be calibrated to help get the most out of a charge. Ilife 11 is a great addition with this laptop and apps like iMovie and iPhoto couldn't be easier to use. Portability isn't as good as the 13' but with this computer being pretty much 2x-3x faster that the 2010 13' I'm not complaining. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if your thinking about converting to a Mac, DO IT! You will be very satisfied.PROS1. The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).2. The battery life is great. ( A little less than my 2010 13' mbp but it averages about 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on what I'm doing so I'm not complaining)3. Osx Lion is a great upgrade from snow leopard and does a great job at keeping everything organized and fast.4. Great apps included like Garageband and iPhoto.5. The case looks very sleek, thin, and professional and the backlit keyboard can be super bright or dim depending on how you want it.6. Bootcamp is a great feature that many people may not know used to run windows on your mac if needed. 7. The screen is extremely bright and big and hd videos look crisp and clear.CONS1. Price is a little steep compared to other pc's with the same specs.2. When running windows the laptop can get very warm.3. In the new Lion OSX power pc run apps and games is not supported anymore.","Date":"August 14, 2011"}

When I used to compare it with my personal windows laptop, actually I could not compare...there was nothing to compare. Macbook was light years ahead of it. Another plus was that with Mac OSX, you can surf the web without worrying the intrusion of spywares and viruses in your machine, effectively eliminating the need for an anti virus. All these factors were compelling enough for me to shell out 1700$ to make it mine.I have now upgraded to LION OS and oh boyyy...using it is like biting through a cheesecake...smooth! I also do a lot of photography and developing pics is just an out of the world experience on Mac. The screen is so vibrant that the pics almost speak out. I have a glossy screen and since I mostly use it indoors, I got no issues. In fact I love it more than the anti-glare one.Coming to the performance, well this is supposed to the most advanced laptop in the market and it truly lives up to its name. The booting (after installing LION) is around 30-40 seconds! The clicks are so responsive that I have forgotten what latency is, the speakers are a nice addition and it even has a slot for SDHC cards...I can just takes pics and insert the memory card directly into this slot and boom...its done. Goodbye USB cables, now I don't need to depend on you. Lastly the batter life is amazing, it gives me around 6 hrs on normal work and around 5-5.5 hours with wi-fi on.All in all, thumbs up for Macbook Pro and also to Amazon for letting me have a 100$ waiver.","Date":"July 30, 2011"}

I needed a Macbook Pro with a built in optical drive due to the nature of of my work so I didn't want to get the latest model of the Macbook Pro.  Although this review is not for the seller, I will just say that this laptop was in pristine condition and everyone that I have shown it to says that it looks brand new.That said, the Quad Core i7 in this machine is perfect.  The only thing i did is upgrade the RAM.  It is very fast for all tasks and I do a lot of media heavy (i.e. - audio and video editing) things that require a lot.  Is it a Mac Pro?  Certainly not, but by necessity I do much of my work on the go and a desktop is out of the question most of the time.Even though this machine is a couple years old it has more than enough horsepower for 99.9% of standard computer users and even though for power users.  If you want the latest/greatest like Retina display, thinner, lighter, then this isn't for you, but if you want an laptop with a built in optical drive that still delivers on the power side, this Macbook Pro definitely delivers.  I got my unit for just over $1000 which I felt was a great deal, especially given the perfect condition.

{"Title":"Replacing my road worn Titanium PowerBook...","Author":"David M \"professordavid\"","ReviewID":"R5ZO8S07NR97A","Overall":"good","Content":"I just received my new 17\" MacBook Pro. I was a bit reluctant to replace my totally worn out PB 15 Titanium which is over 4 years ago: dings, replaced frames, and other maladies from falls, travel, etc. \"Reluctant\" due to the new operating system, new chips, new about everything. And then there's the issue of a ton of gigabytes and programs moved over to a new machine. Geez. What's that... days of adjustment, reloading, re-installing, and finding serial numbers.Before that though, the experience of taking it from its box was remarkable. Who else but Apple would think about the slick box that it comes in? But the accessory box was missing... or was it. The cable adapters were there, a cool remote control (that works with Keynote), and a tight little kit of DVDs and DVD-sized books. That was it. Of course, I didn't read anything... I'm too impatient.So, that takes me to set-up etc. I started it up, it asked if I had a Mac and would I like to migrate my files (and applications). I said yes. It demanded a Firewire cable for the deed, I complied [not provided, but I had one]. About an hour later, I had a fully operational MacBook with all of my old applications working. No dragging, serial number stuff, or otherwise (so far, that is). A seamless transition. I did need to state that my music would be authorized on the new computer. The easiest move ever. As though I was using my old computer with everything intact, but now a new, wide screen, ultrafast environment. So a little over an hour after taking it out of the box, I was using Creative Suite and other apps with abandon.I don't want to discuss all the enhancements and how well they work since better reviewers than I have already done so. But I will do a few highlights. First, the wide screen is real estate I sorely needed (and no twisting that might cause the battery to drop out), not too heavy, but real estate and bright. It rests for hours on my leg and I fell no excess heat. The new magnetic charger connection is great: as you approach the plug it literally is sucked into the connection. And the lighted keyboard for dark room users -- awesome.So far, all of my applications work except Virtual PC which I anticipated. I did need to trash the try-out Microsoft suite since my licensed version was co-installed (and doubling clicking took me to the try-out version rather than my version).I haven't tried the emulation via Boot Camp, but perhaps the Parallels Virtual System might be better. The latter offers simultaneous operation. I have no choice since an important testing system is PC only, and we use it for 1000 students year.As we would all expect, everything moves so totally quickly, that I have few barriers to productivity. And that was an initial fear. So this is a brief review focussed more on migration and seamless operation. In these respects, I could not be happier. It's a Mac, in spite of the Intel processor, with all the usual simplicities and convenience. Other barriers to productivity? I haven't found them yet.","Date":"June 18, 2006"}

These are not called laptop computers, folks - they are portables. If you're doing processor intensive work with this on your lap, you're gonna cook your loins.  For less money, you can get a cheap PC laptop that weighs 15lbs and is about 3\" thick to absorb the heat it generates. If you want the best in portables without sacrificing screen real estate, this is the one to get.The MagSafe power adapter is pure genius. No more cats or kids making your investment fly across the livingroom. If your foot snags on the power cord, it yanks out of the portable, instead of denting your DC-in board or crashing your computer to the ground.FrontRow offers you what no other portable has - remote control for your tunes, your videos and your entire iLife. iLife '06 is pre-installed and other than perhaps a carrying case and a copy of Microsoft Office, you won't find yourself having to buy a lot of stuff to go with your investment.

Be sure to snag an AppleCare protection plan with your purchase. AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) covers your computer for 3 years... otherwise you have a one year warranty and out of warranty repairs for portables are not cheap... starting at about $310 out of warranty.If you're used to using your portable for faxing, you'll need to pick up a USB modem. Apple believes that modems have gone the way of the Do-Do bird, despite the fact that all fax machines still use 28k-56k modems. Who knows what tomorrow may bring, though. Apple was the first to ditch the floppy drive, and thank goodness they did! They got a lot of heat over that decision, but it is a trend the industry has now embraced.","Date":"May 20, 2006"}

Quality, Value, Good Support, Application Support.- Value: With my MBP I get a high speed process 2 GHz+, 2GB ram, 17 in monitor, 100 GB disk space @7500, 3 USB ports, 2 400 and 1 800 firewire port.  I priced this a comparable on Dell and a few other model and either way you slice it this will cost north of $3,000.  Whether it's a high end gaming device, whatever, it will cost you.  My MBP came in at slightly over $3,100 and that included Aperture and 3 years of support.  I dare anyone to make a case for a cheaper alternative with a PC.- Quality: What can you say?  The heat output on this is about the same as other Intel based machines I've had.  It sounds like that is more than the traditional Mac laptops, but as far as Intel laptops go it's about the same.  All of the other cosmetic stuff is just fine.- Application Support: There is plenty written about Photoshop CS2 running on MacTel machines and the performance issue.  I read some of the tests, and no only were they unusually taxing given typical use of PS, they were unrealistic for all but the photo pro who must process large numbers of complex batch jobs.- Support:  I have called Apple support a few times.

{"Title":"Best of both worlds","Author":"David R. Tidmore \"mac fanatic\"","ReviewID":"RYBC5L8U9OGNA","Overall":"good","Content":"For starters, things did not go well initially.  My new MacBook Pro (MBP) 17\" died 6 hours into its life.  Conversations with Apple confirmed the situation, but since I had purchased my MBP at an Apple retailer (not an Apple Store), all Apple could do is schedule it in for repair, but they recommended that I return it as DOA.  I knew my local Fry's Electronics sold me the last MBP17\" they had, but Fry's checked the other stores in the DFW area and found another store with several still in stock.  it was a 120 mile round trip but at least I got a brand new MBP and life has been WONDERFUL since.  I am a long time Windows user, but I also am very comfortable in the Mac environment( as well as UNIX).  I purchased Parallels Desktop for Mac (FORGET Bootcamp) and loaded in XP Pro and the various Windows apps that I knew I would need either due to lack of comparable Mac software or during the transition.  The MBP has to be experienced to be believed.  XP running in a Virtual Machine (VM Parallels Desktop) is WAY faster than native on a  1.8GHZ ATHLON/512MB machine. OSX Tiger is LIGHTYEARS ahead of XP and Leopard looks like it will leapfrog whatever Vista actually becomes.  It does take some getting use to having to use the function key + delete or home or end or pageup or page down to get the those functions in XP, but once you get the hang of it no problem.  I also got the Apple Mighty Mouse and it makes XP a LOT nicer than trying to work with a single button mouse.  I am upgrading to 2GB of Ram since OSX and XP running at the same time chews through the standard 1GB completely (11-15MB left).  Once a 7200RPM Perpendicular Recording is available from Hitachi, I will be moving up from the standard 120GB/5400RPM drive.If you are a Windows user and want to move to the realm of the enlightened, buy a MBP and Parallels Desktop for Mac for those moments when you need a fix of XP.","Date":"September 1, 2006"}

When Apple came out with the duo core Intel processor, I still wasn't convinced that I could happily move to a new system. Let me tell you; it is the finest computer I have ever owned! I have this gut feeling that Apple made this dual OS move to convince PC users once and for all; this is the only computer you will ever want.There is plenty of support out there for learning the new language of Mac, but it is amazingly easy. The first thing you must learn is that Mac is intuitive. I was prepared to go through pages of setup instructions to hook up my internet, but Mac did it all for me, no questions, no permissions, just had to enter my WEP key to enter my service provider environment. WOW!Switching between systems? Boot, hold down the 'options' key, and choose your system. I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.What is hard to get used to? No 'delete' key (Mac has a 'delete' key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse 'click' functions to delete things. Also, No 'home' or 'end' keys. All the above functions require 2 key-strokes on the Mac.This is the only trouble I have found; It pales in comparison to the nightmares of Virus software, updates for security and everything else that seemed to drag my old system down.

{"Title":"Great laptop with a couple of caveats","Author":"Another Weekend Warrior \"armie\"","ReviewID":"R74KVLVVB46YF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've used both the black 13\" MacBook and now have the 17\" MacBook Pro. I'll list the pros and cons of the 17\" Pro.Pros1. ENORMOUS SCREEN - I literally have two desktop computers at home that have smaller screens!2. Built in iSight - Convenient3. MagSafe Connector - innovative, especially around clumsy people and children4. Duo core processor - The power doesn't show up unless you're doing intensive graphics work or programming5. Keys that light up in the dark - Even though I can type without looking at the keys, it's great when you're on the train and can find the function key6. Bluetooth - for obvious reasons7. Firewire 800 - for obvious reasonsCons1. Probably the biggest is the surprising amount of defects and poor customer support for their products. I get my computers from my job and we got them as soon as they were available. That might have been a mistake, as we ran into a number of defects, including the infamous mac shutdown problem. Just do a search for \"random mac shutdown\" on google to see he horror. Someone even filmed their problem and showed it on youtube. I won't go through the other defects other than to say I wouldn't DREAM of getting a MacBook/Pro without getting an extended warranty. As others have also mentioned, the turn around time for them to fix your product is VERY slow, and we should have preferntial treatment with them, considering we do work for them (won't go into further details on that). Ultimately, if Apple realizes they've put out a defective product, the solution (especially on a $3000 laptop) would be to send out the white macbook as a loaner while they waited for parts to arrive.2. Probably not the most conducive for the train. I got this laptop simply because I had the option to. If you travel a lot, you'd probably be better off with a 13\" MacBook as opposed to this. If you're on a plane or train, you'll quickly realize just how big this laptop is. However, since there's no way to make a 17\" also small at the same time, just note what I'm saying. Sometimes it's great that the screen is so huge. Sometimes it's slightly inconvenient.4. The placement of the keys. This might also be due to the large size, but there is a lot of space between the keyboard and the mouse area. I initally found my wrists resting on this area and it was starting to cause me pain. I therefore now have to type with my wrists slightly elevated to avoid resting my hands on an area that simply would not be there on a smaller laptop. The only solution to this problem would be to move the keyboard forward.As a final note, unless you're doing extensive graphics work, my opinion is that you'll get more bang for the buck by getting the black 13\" MacBook. The speed difference between the Pro and the MacBook is 0.16 MHz, basically negligible. In my case, I hook up the laptop to a 23\" screen at work, so only when I'm on the road is the size of the screen even an issue anyway. And again, if you're not doing extensive graphics work, I'd say it's not worth it. For half the price, you can get more bang for the buck.","Date":"December 16, 2006"}

I adored my 17\" Powerbook and, due to someone in my corporate IT department dropping my Powerbook, was forced to get a new MacBook to replace it. The transition hasn't been a smooth one.If you are a designer or photographer (after all, isn't that who Apple supposedly builds these machines for?) you will immediately notice that Adobe has not yet rewritten their suite for the new Intel processors. This means serious lag whilst they run through Rosetta. Not pretty. If you routinely create and work with large layered files in Photoshop as I do, plan to stay late at work more often.Another major issue has been the heat of the processors. The back of my MacBook Pro is so hot I can only touch it for a couple of seconds (top and bottom). Mind you, I have this machine seated on an iCurve stand which allows air to flow all around the machine. I rarely hear the fan/s kick on and I worry about traveling with this unit. You cannot place it on your lap and when I am in hotels I am nervous about having it seated directly on a wooden desk. Sounds like a future recall to me.We professionals know that the first issue of most Apple products are far from the best. My advice? Wait until Adobe releases CS3 next Spring (perhaps before Macworld in January). By that point many of these issues may be ironed out. Until then, I'm longing for my mangled Powerbook.","Date":"September 10, 2006"}

{"Title":"Very happy so far","Author":"N. Caine","ReviewID":"R1JAV35KNABY2Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I got this to succeed an HP Pavilion AMD Duron ZE series laptop.  I got the HP a few years ago after trying a lot of laptops, because I liked the keyboard feel (I typed without looking on many keyboards and the HP had the fewest keyboard-caused typos) and I found the text sharp.  Over time I was held back by:  1) the sound never worked without stuttering, 2) even with a memory upgrade, it was very slow running XP SP2, and 3) the screen was hard to read in a brightly lit room.  I could fix none of these, even after removing every memory resident program, uninstalling all unnecessary software, and using a professional defrag program. But the laptop otherwise served me well.  One thing I learned about laptops:  their performance is influenced largely by the rotational speed of the hard drive and the amount of memory you put in.The Toshiba, which I got on sale, has been a joy.  For a budget laptop, it is one of the few I have found with a 5400 rpm hard drive, and that has made a huge difference!  I also added more memory (512 should be your minimum, but adding a 1 gig module is advised).  Everything works quickly and I have found no little annoying things!  The screen is marvelous:  huge and bright.  Dvd's are gorgeous, especially when using the Dvd player's widescreen mode.  The sound is great.  4 high speed USB ports are wonderful, as they fill up quickly!  The wireless not only works very well, but has a conveniently located on/off switch, so you can turn it off to save energy, a feature not available on the wireless card I added to the HP.  I also like the fact that the Toshiba's only \"extra\" buttons are dvd-type controls (play, pause, etc.).  I find too many extra buttons goofy.  The Toshiba is also lighter than the HP and is thinner.  I'm amazed.On the down side, yes they saved money on the battery.  I do not have experience of long battery lives on laptops in the past couple of years anyway, so I wasn't surprised.  The battery comes out easily if you want to buy an extra.  I'm used to taking my a/c adapter everywhere.  Yet another pleasant surprise is that the a/c adapter is smaller and lighter than my HP's.  Since I take it wherever I take the laptop, this is actually an important feature!Overall, I'm thrilled.

I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for $499 with a free RAM upgrade to 512. I needed to replace my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron 7000 that was just getting too clunky and trouble-prone, the main problem being it took a full 15 minutes to start up. Anyway I want to talk about the Satellite not the Inspiron. The 15.1 inch wide screen is deliciously beautiful. I cannot accent this point enough. Fantastic for web surfing, dvd viewing, digital snapshot sharing, Hauppauge USB TV viewing, anything. The sound is also top-rate, excellent stereo separation, which I was surprised to hear on most commercials when I started using my above-mentioned USB TV tuner, which I will review separately (mini- review = excellent).The weight is perfect for carrying around constantly for whatever use you may think of, this laptop is really an all-around jack of all trades.Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the short battery life. One hour seems to ne the limit, grossly short compared to my Dell Inspiron. Of course that is not a reflection on the laptop as much as it is on the battery - just get a better one or a spare one.Also need to warn buyers that what brings the price down markedly is the fact that it only comes (at least mine did) with a 6-monh trial of MS Word, Excel, & PowerPoint, but I solved this problem by backing up my 6-year-old Dell to a 300 gb Seagate external hard drive, and all those apps seem to run on the Satellite off the Seagate drive. Also, Sun has free beta programs that mimmick them.So if you see this laptop in the $500 range, grab it - you won't be sorry.","Date":"April 18, 2006"}

If you could carry 50 lbs, why not do it instead of carrying 500 lbs. When the computer has many software inside which it does not need, it will run slower & slower. 4) ruffly handling the computer is a \"no, no\", your laptop is a sensitive & fragile electronic device, handle it very gently or you will pay the price for damaging it. I used cushion to sandwich between my laptop in the computer carry Targus bag. The cushion of computer bag does not have enough cushion to keep the computer from shock injury. 5) used the dust blower can to blast out the dirt every once & a while. I am in deployment right now & dust has got into my broadband portal, at first I thought something wrong with my computer why it did not connect. After blasting into the portal connection, the connection work again, no more problem since. At this time, you can get one on Ebay around 399.00 or less plus shipping, just continue to bid & look eventually you will find a nice one. Well, I hope my comment help & God blessed.","Date":"July 5, 2007"}

The motherboard failed and is costing me around $400 to diagnose and repair.  The more I look online at Toshiba's past problems and law suits regarding other Satellite versions, I would NOT purchase one.  I called Toshiba to get help and they were mean, rude, and unwilling to help.  I am very careful with the care of my laptop and have been since I made this major purchase.  Good luck if you buy one.

{"Title":"Not for music; poor customer service","Author":"Stixter \"Stixter\"","ReviewID":"R120JK3R4O3PGL","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought a Toshiba A105-S101 from Best Buy with an additional 256 MB of memory for $499 in Feb `06.  At the time I thought it was a steal.  In retrospect, I should have left it at the store.I bought this computer to use as a jukebox.  While it performs adequately at most tasks, the machine fails miserably as a sound reproducer - it induces a garbled distortion that one hears at the end of music and system sounds as well as in quiet musical passages.  Though Toshiba's tech support was professional and courteous, they were not able to fix the problem over the phone.  So far, I have had the system board replaced twice, and as I write, it sits at Toshiba's corporate office for \"evaluation\".  They have had it for two weeks and I have heard no news from them.  They never call back or answer e-mails.  I feel I have wasted $500 and a lot of time on the phone and shipping the thing in for repair.The three system boards (original and two replacements) have all displayed the same problem, so I can't help but conclude that it is a design problem with the model, not a problem with my machine.  Yes, I have good ears, and maybe some folks wouldn't ever notice the problem, but I have four Dell machines that sound great with the same music sources; the last thing I expected was that this new machine from a highly respected manufacturer would have such a fatal flaw.If you are planning to use this machine for music, test it first in the store with headphones before buying.Long story short, I gave Toshiba a chance to redeem itself through good customer service and they are failing at that, too.  Upset?  You bet!","Date":"August 1, 2006"}

I don't use it for any heavy/intense gaming or anything it should last for quite a while :)Recommendation:Buy it if you want a simple browsing laptop or to read/watch some movies on it.Maybe as a backup to store  your personal data that you need to quickly access if your main computer ever goes down. Don't expect some awesome machine though; it's a dinosaur!PS - Double check what you're getting!

{"Title":"Excellent Laptop","Author":"Darren He \"in Boston\"","ReviewID":"R2MEC7FNZ0SZ31","Overall":"good","Content":"The Thinkpad T series is IBM/Lenovo's standard business laptop, and as a college student, I have found it to be perfect. I have the T60 model with the specs listed above: T2500 (2GHz Core Duo), 1 GB Ram, 100 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive, Bluetooth, Wireless Internet, Fingerprint Reader, Windows XP SP2, 128 MB ATI Radeon x1400. The laptop is very well constructed and sturdy. The keyboard is excellent, and very responsive. The screen is slightly dim, but I usually use it at an even dimmer setting anyways to conserve battery life. I also have a dock and a 21\" widescreen monitor. Recently, when my computer became infected, I merely used the backup sector (which takes away 20GB from your hard drive) to reload everything - it was a lot easier than manually reformatting, installing Windows, installing the thinkpad drivers, etc. The drivers are also very good, with the exception of the Thinkpad Access Connections, which I uninstalled immediately. The embedded security chip works well, if you need to use that. I prefer to key in a password rather than use a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader will not work if there is moisture of your fingertip. It also needs to be recalibrated (i.e. reprogram your fingerprint) every know and then. Since getting a dock though, I've chosen to forego the fingerprint reader completely.I purchased this thinkpad with the accidental damage protection warranty, which means I can do nearly anything to the thinkpad I want, and it will be replaced. Why would I though - it's a great computer.Battery life is pretty good - the 6 cell battery is rated at 3.5 hrs and will give you a decent 2.5. You can always upgrade to a 9 cell battery and/or take out the DVD-burner and stick in an extra battery there.Opening up the T60 is also easy, and allowable under the warranty to some extent - for example, adding RAM or replacing the keyboard (replacement keyboards are shipped overnight!)I also like the matte-ish finish off the laptop cover as well as the screen. All in all, a wonderful laptop, and with a student discount, very affordable. The newer Thinkpads have Core 2 Duo processors (marginal performance increase over the Core Duo in this laptop), and are Vista Ready. You can always upgrade. Highly recommended laptop.","Date":"December 12, 2006"}

I travel a lot for work and preferred Thinkpads because of their rock solid performance.  Now that I've recently upgraded from a T41 to a T60, I think Thinkpads have gone down in quality.  Not sure if it has anything to do with IBM selling the business unit to Lenovo (Chinese company).Anyhow, this T60 feels a lot more \"plasticky\" than the T41.  It just seems cheap and flimsy.  I also have a lot of problems docking and undocking this machine.  With the T41, I can undock the machine, run to a conference room, open the laptop and not miss a beat.  The T60 has problems adjusting screen resolutions, recognizing my mouse on the dock, and crashes with the blue screen of death.  I feel pretty frustrated right now...","Date":"January 31, 2007"}

{"Title":"We have a winner, folks!","Author":"g.naughton","ReviewID":"R831OH9WDGZAY","Overall":"good","Content":"Excellent product. Originally recommended to me by one of my fellow IT friends, I decided to check Amazon for the IBM ThinkPad T60. The price was right, I needed a laptop for email, office applications, and general sysadmin usage. The best part - these laptops are built like a TANK. Good luck breaking these on accident!Data Sales, Co. provided a great description of the laptop. All of the cosmetic wear was correctly described, leaving no surprises. The laptop was cleaned perfectly, packed perfectly, and even came with a copy of Windows XP (Although I just installed Arch Linux.) I ordered a separate battery for the laptop so I had that extra 4 hours of battery life. 8 hours of battery life for ~$150 is the deal of the century.My only issue is when you turn on, wake up, sleep, or take power in or out, the motherboard speaker makes a LOUD beep. This can be avoided by muting the motherboard speaker by pressing a button on the keyboard.The palm rests feel great, the screen looks great (although don't plan on taking this outside in broad daylight - unless you're in shade.) The hinge connecting the screen to the body of the laptop is very strong. You can hold the laptop by the screen and nothing will swing.This laptop can also be used for light gaming! I was shocked! I installed Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source on this laptop to find that both ran at upwards of 60fps and 20fps respectively when I tweaked with settings.All in all, this is a great buy. Do not hesitate, as Lenovo is starting to phase out the glory of the ThinkPad series by using cheaper parts (chiclet keyboards? REALLY?)","Date":"June 25, 2012"}

Sad part was that the system could not identify its own hard drive. This may have been due to upgrading to Win 7.  The laptop itself is very good but the OS installed was bad (Windows 7).  T60 was not designed for Window 7 but for Win XP. Therefore, I went to SafeNet Computer Repair (9 West 29th Street in Manhattan - excellent repair shop and does not overcharge) and requested them to reload Windows XP Enterprise, increase the RAM from 512 to 4G, Increased Hard Drive from 60GB to 300GB and it's perfect.  Invested an additional $250 to make it work and it's ok now.

{"Title":"Wonderful for an old laptop","Author":"Cheshire Plays Chess","ReviewID":"R9W2AMQ81N70O","Overall":"good","Content":"The old thinkpads, including the early ones made by Lenovo, have to be among the best designed laptops ever made. Easy to replace an optical drive. Easy to replace a hard drive. Such a contrast with my old Apple G4 iBook, which I dearly love, which has a disk permanently stuck in a broken optical drive. The cost of replacing the optical drive on that machine would be more than the laptop is worth. The T60 keyboard is every bit as good as the g4 iBook keyboard. The light above the screen on the T60 to illuminate the keyboard is a very nice touch. The 4:3 aspect ratio screen is the best screen I've seen since my old Compaq Presario 1215US from 2001. One catch to warn about is the volume control on Windows 7 Pro. The Windows volume control gives you only the percentage of whatever volume is set by the volume buttons. I suggest setting the Windows volume control at 100% and then using only the thinkpad volume control buttons to set your volume. I was almost fooled by this glitch into thinking my T60 had defective speakers. It was a Microsoft problem! For Linux users, a Point Linux (Debian derivative with Mate Desktop) live DVD ran well on this machine with wireless working out-of-the-box.","Date":"April 11, 2014"}

The seller emailed me to wait and it would sort itself out,When the thing finally arrived, it was filthy inside and outside.  A large sticky smear graced the lid.  Under every key there were long black hairs mashed together with dust and other unidentifiable debris.  The screen was almost opaque from the stuff on it.The T60 is known for being easily user serviceable.  It should have been trivial to reassemble this laptop into its original condition. When it arrived, the palmrest was loose all along its edges;  it had not even been refastened down correctly.Many of the keys had no face on them. This version of the T60 does not have easily replaceable keys and it shouldn't have needed to be done, anyway.  Anyone who is not a touch typist, even though most programmers are, could not easily use the keyboard.The laptop's memory was an unadvertised 512 megabytes.  This is gastropodial by today's standards. Added to this, the laptop would not even boot when the second gigabyte from my failed T60 was added - it would only take  one gigabyte card and one 515 megabyte card.The battery would not hold a minute's worth of charge.  When combined with the fact that the advertised power shortage was no power cord, this would have left a purchaser without a previous similar model without any source of power at all.The video card was so regressed Debian fainted and could not install Gnome.This seller has decided to sell laptops stripped of everything that can be resold and leave it up to the purchaser to find that out. I would not buy from them again.  I did not return this one because in the process of investigating its shortcomings I did change its original state, for example filthy to clean, fastening down the palmrest, etc. and do not want the additional annoyance of dealing with return postage and arguments  over original vs. returned condition.The one thing it did have as advertised, other than a functioning motherboard, working wireless and an irrelevant Windows installation, was the 120 gigabyte harddrive.","Date":"January 10, 2014"}

The key-board of these machines have been written about by numerous reviewers. The keyboard is the best , period. My wife has had 3 computers Sony Toshiba and Dell and all of them failed to match the Lenovo keyboard. The screen is non-glossy unlike every other machine nowadays. The speakers are powerful and natural sounding, unlike most junk machines from Sony. To make a long story short this Lenovo laptop is made the old fashioned way :) from quality Chinese part, not junk Chinese parts.A bit about a value for the money:My laptop was bought for $270 2 years ago , it has 2-core 2.33Ghz processor, 3Gig of RAM (4gig if you use Win7), Radeon 1400XT dedicated video card with 512 megs of memory and large HD.

{"Title":"HP Compaq nc6400 Business Notebook (Refurbished)","Author":"808IsLaNDGiRL","ReviewID":"R7P9DVZLG5BSG","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been an Amazon customer for nearly a decade and haven't had any issues with Amazon or any sellers. With all of the items and thousands of dollars spent on this website, this is the very first \"review\" I am writing. I was very hesitant about purchasing this refurbished laptop. You don't really know what you are actually buying with transactions like these.I purchased my laptop from GothamCityMall. We received the package via USPS a day earlier than expected, was not expecting that! So I really didn't know what to expect when I opened the box. And boy was I surprised! After removing the various layers of bubble wrap and tape, I unwrapped a pretty cool-looking piece of machinery. It is definitely an old model, but it still looks just as sexy as the new guys out there on the market today. Also, the laptop may have been refurbished, but it looks far from used! Cosmetically, it was almost perfect except for one tiny scratch on the cover. The keyboard, screen, battery/cords were also in new condition. If I didn't know any better, I would think this machine was brand new. I really got lucky with this one!Before purchasing this refurbished laptop, we had the pleasuring of using a relative's brand new Inspiron Notebook for almost 2yrs. Although my nc6400 isn't quite as sleek in the looks department, it does pretty much everything that the Inspiron did. I'm pleasantly surprised!It handles multiple windows of web browsing, creates documents w/ease, plays Netflix videos (sound is great), and whatever else you can throw at it, all at the same time...without any problems with performance. The physical size and weight of this laptop is perfect! I hated lugging around the huge and incredibly heavy 15\" Inspiron. This thing is a baby in comparison! The layout of the keyboard and the feel of the keys is wonderful. I also like the matte screen compared to the high-gloss screen of the Inspiron. Fingerprints from my 2 1/2 year old are much less noticeable. My most favorite feature on the keyboard itself is the handy row of buttons at the top, volume included. The Inspiron didn't have volume buttons, making it quite an inconvenience to make adjustments.I'm not sure if I will be using this laptop to play games, but I'm sure it can handle it without a problem. We'll have to see though. I haven't watched DVD's or listened to music on it yet either, but I do love that I can burn DVD's or CD's as well. The 3 USB ports are handy; I'm only using about 2 at a time for my flash drive and wireless mouse. The smart/memory card slots are also handy for a family like ours that takes a lot of pictures.Because this machine was built for the office (I use it for Home), it has many features that I don't have the need for. They are great tools to have when and if I decide to use this machine in an office setting. The one \"office\" feature I do use is the Fingerprint Scanner. It's pretty cool and easy to set up.If you are debating between buying a new/newer laptop or even a used version of this laptop, stop fighting with yourself. It is risky buying used/refurbished electronics online, but it's a risk I'm so happy I decided to take. I spent less than $200 (shipping included) on a quality piece of machinery that does everything that I need it to do, and is comparable performance-wise, to the newer and MUCH MORE expensive laptops that are selling now.","Date":"February 29, 2012"}

It's just something that I would carry with me while traveling. It's small, lightweight, and it gets the job done.What I like about it:* The keyboard is normal size.* The touchpad works fine.* It has plenty of ports for connecting devices.* It's fast enough for me (surfing the web, checking email, OpenOffice, listen to music, watch movies, etc.)* The screen is large enough; it's bright and has good color* It includes a DVD/CD drive* It's reliable, good quality, and well made* Wireless card included (for Internet)I removed all non-essential software from it, including the \"fingerprint security detection\" software. This helps to keep it running fast.With adequate padding included, the notebook, cord, and charger fit nicely inside a USPS Priority Mail medium flat rate box (13-5/8\" x 11-7/8\" x 3-3/8\"). And that works great if you are giving it as a gift (like to a soldier who needs one to keep in touch with family/friends back home).Things to keep in mind if you are purchasing it used; verify that...* it comes with an operating system like Windows XP* the battery, charger, and cord are included* the battery still hold a charge (unless you just plan to plug it in when using it)* it has enough RAM memory for your needs* it is in working orderI'm pleased with my purchase and would buy one of these notebooks again, if needed.","Date":"October 24, 2013"}

I have had no issues beyond only one with this Lenovo (IBM) ThinkPad: it is a Centrino Due. A slower processor that I have not found to run hot, and it has not crashed either. All and all it is a good machine. The battery has lasted up 3.5 hours with normal use of MS office and desktop publishing. Not unexpected considering the age of which this computer came out. That also can be solved by purchasing any one of the many extended battery methods on the market. I do not use the Lenovo T60P to travel much away from home, I bought the Lenovo X41 for this and an extended battery that last me a good six hours of MS Office time (the X41 cannot handle desktop publishing but I don't require that when I am away from home--who does?). For me, whatever the subject, it has always been \"the right tool for the right job!\"Oh, one more thing if anyone is reading this, I am not a rich man, if I was I would have the latest and greatest computers, one for the road and one for home as now.

{"Title":"Awesome laptop for the price!","Author":"Whereeaglesnest","ReviewID":"R57IKEBZP713O","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned the 1.8 P4 version for 2 years and I am considering buying one just to have should anything happen to this one. Even by today's standards this is a very good laptop. The ONLY drawback is that there is only 1 USB port and it is 1.1 but that is very easily solved with a $15 PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 ports. This is not a \"gamer\" laptop but it is a serious workhorse that you can adapt in so many ways to your needs that you can't with most even today. For example, if you tend to need more battery time than the DVD drive (I upgraded my CD to a DVD burner) then just pop out the DVD and pop in an extra battery. Or like in my case I wanted more hard drive so I bought a 100 gig to replace the main hard drive and by doing a little surfing online I found a parts place that sells an enclosure for a second hard drive that fits perfectly into the DVD slot, so since I do not need the DVD very often I have another 100 gig drive in most of the time, how cool is that!? Add to that that it has S video out, vga out plus a keyboard port in case you prefer a regular keyboard when at home. The video is a respectable 32 meg ATI and I have run some games and applications that were not suppose to be able to run on it according to specs. This laptop only accepts 1 gig total memory but under XP that is fine and will keep you moving along smoothly. I ordered mine with the wireless networking card (802.11b but you can buy very cheaply a G card that will go right in to replace the B card or if yours doesn't come with a card you can add one VERY cheaply) and the speeds are so close to my G PCMCIA card that I use the B card built into mine with my G router.When you really look at just what your getting for a comparable price these days, for everything this one is capable of I cannot recommend grabbing one of these enough, it is sturdy, nice size screen (14.1) and just an overall feeling of confidence in this laptop because it \"feels\" durable. When these were brand new I'm told you could not by them as an individual as they were only meant for business purchasers.Bottom line: you want something worth the money this is it no question. Admittedly I put another $200 into mine but that was all upgrades to the memory and DVD and adding another hard drive. As it comes it is an awesome deal in today's market will run rings around many laptops in the same price range.In case you missed it through all the techie talk, buy this laptop!Dell Latitude C640 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 256MB/60GB/CD Drive Notebook Computer","Date":"December 9, 2007"}

How can you beat this? It's only around five pounds and packs incredible power at an amazing price. It's a great deal by the best laptop maker out there. The positives totally outweigh the negatives, but I will mention the few problems. The system makes more fan noise than most other models. If the system were more expensive this would be a deal breaker, but again, this powerful laptop is cheap! The other problem is how the system performs out of the box. As usual the system comes with a ton of pre-installed garbage. It took me 4-8 hours to wipe the hard drive, re-image it with a clean OS, and install the Toshiba drivers. Once this was complete the system worked to my satisfaction. This would be a five star review if the system worked well out of the box.

{"Title":"The BEST student laptop!","Author":"Andrea Horne \"WCU Student\"","ReviewID":"RDJR6J8VHGZUQ","Overall":"good","Content":"Being a college student, I am always looking for ways to save money.  After a semester of living without a laptop and constantly having to go over to the computer lab which was anything but conducive to studying and writing, I finally realized it was time to buy my own laptop.  With so many options on the market, I spent much of my winter vacation trying to figure out which model I would finally decide on.  The driving factor in my decision was price.  I knew that I wanted to spend under one-thousand bucks for the laptop and any needed accessories.  I called up my brother, the computer whiz, and asked for his opinion.  He told me to look into Toshiba, and that started my two week long search that ultimately led me to this laptop.I went to Best Buy, WalMart, Target, etc to test out many different models of many different laptops.  The first thing I noticed with this Toshiba is the screen.  For being only 14.1 inches, you barely notice that it is inferior in size to the bigger 17 inch models.  The colors are vivid, the pictures are as clear as can be, and while testing watching DVDs on it, I felt like I was watching High Def. TV.  I decided after that point to research the model farther, and eventually ended up buying it.I ordered my M115 from CompUSA and it arrived within two short days.  I opened the box and started set-up.  I was amazed at how few annoyances I had with a laptop that cost me so little.  Usually you are going to sacrifice SOMETHING if you're buying a cheaper product, no matter what that product may be.  Of course, as I delved deeper into testing this laptop, I figured out several reasons why it is in the budget category.Now that the laptop was home, it was time to start other tests.  I had already tested the screen at the store, and like I said, it passed with flying colors.  Next I tested the battery life.  I put in my extended version of \"The Return of the King\" and let the battery run down.  I kept the laptop at full brightness and did NOT use power saver mode.  It took two hours and fifty-five minutes before the laptop shut off.  This is EXCELLENT for a six-cell battery under the conditions I put it in.Next, I tested the laptop battery for word processing on the lowest brightness possible with power saver mode.  The battery was empty after four hours and five minutes.  I was extremely pleased with these results because I use this laptop for word processing in class where I can't charge it up if it runs out of battery, and over four hours is more than enough for me.  However, if you are truly concerned about battery life, you can always buy a spare and keep it charged.After the battery had taken a good beating from all the testing, I started testing sound quality.  I popped in my \"Best of the Classics\" CD and started messing around with the sound settings.  On lower settings, the sound quality is not the best.  However, the higher you put the volume, the better quality you will get from the speakers.  I finally found the perfect spot on the volume adjuster for listening to CDs.  However, I need to adjust when watching DVDs and Videos...generally you need to turn the volume up a bit for that.  All in all, I was happy with the speakers and sound quality, but not blown away.After taking my CD out, I started opening every application on the laptop.  This way, I could see approximately how many applications I could have open before the laptop either seized up or got horrendously slow.  I opened the internet, my word processor, photoshop, my digital photography suite that is connected to my printer, my website editor and finally, I started running the virus-scan.  This is a lot to ask of any computer, but especially of one that only runs on 512MB.  I found that it ran the applications well up until I opened the website editor.  It was just too much for the little M115 to handle.  This was expected from a machine that only runs on 512MB, and I decided at that point that an upgrade to 1GB would be needed.  I ordered another 512MB the next day, and can now run all the applications I want.  From time to time they will slow up a bit, but the fact that it can even handle that work load is awesome and a definite must, since I'm a multi-tasker.This laptop comes with an 80GB HD, and some today say the new standard is at least 100GB.  To be honest, I think that's a complete crock of sh**.  I have an old Compaq (from 1999) that still works, and it has a 15GB HD, with only 11GB usable.  If I can operate that machine (and I can), then 80GB is luxury.  I have all the programs I need installed on this machine and I still have 55GB free.  Will I use it?  Probably not.  Would I need 100GB?  No way!  Unless you are someone who is using cr**loads of programs that require installation on the computer, then there is NO need for anything bigger than 80GB while operating on a Windows XP machine.  Maybe when it's time to upgrade to Vista, but for now, it is just not necessary.  Besides, you will not be upgrading to Vista on this laptop.  I know several Microsoft developers and they all have Vista already...and some of them can't even run it on machines with 100GB HDs and 2GB memory.  So yeah, stick with XP and you will be fine with 80GB HD and 1GB memory (RAM).One annoyance I had after setting up this laptop is finding the amount of bloatware that came with it.  It can be easily removed, but the fact that so much of it was even on my little M115 was a serious gripe for me.  This is probably one of the reasons why it was so cheap--lots of manufacturers being advertised from start-up.  I now have altered it to my liking, but it takes some time and patience.Another thing to keep in mind is that this laptop is not for extreme gamers.  I do a lot of graphic design with digital photography and I can work from this laptop, but it isn't the best home-base for my work.  This is more of a laptop that you would use for typical programs like the internet, word-processing, light gaming, light photo-editing, movie-watching, music listening and chatting.  It's great for the TYPICAL user...but don't buy this laptop and then complain that you can't run your huge graphic-demanding games on it without giving up some quality...if you're in that boat, you should go with an Alienware.Some annoyances that have been listed with this laptop, other than battery life which I have already covered, are the keyboard and some complaints of overheating or loud fan noise.  The keyboard is cramped.  No two ways about it.  This is a small laptop, and the keyboard is spread nicely on it, but it is still cramped.  I have small hands so this is not a problem, but a someone with huge piano fingers would probably have a hard time with typing.  A very hard time.  Test the laptop out at a store before buying it, because if you don't you could be sorely disappointed.  I did not notice ANY overheating...it gets warm, but in no way does it \"overheat.\"  There is some fan noise, but very little.  It turns on every 5-10 minutes for about two seconds when using the laptop under normal use.My last note on this laptop is that I wish it had come with a faster processor.  I have altered it so that it is up to what I want as far as performance goes, but come on, Intel Core 2 Duo is the standard now.  Not Intel Core Duo.  Hopefully Toshiba will change this on future M115 models, because I would love to get a younger sibling of this laptop at some point.For what I paid, I could not have gotten better.  This laptop gets the job done and is the best of the best in budget laptops.  Buy another 512MB of RAM, and you will be good to go.RATINGS:Screen Quality: 10/10Sound Quality: 7/10Operation Speed: 8/10 (after upgrade) or 6.5/10 (before upgrade)Battery life: 7.5/10 (excellent for a six-cell battery!!!)Out-of-box quality: 6/10Price: 10/10Design: 8/10Why not 10/10?Screen Qualiy deductions: -0.

{"Title":"so far so good","Author":"J. Mei","ReviewID":"R1T3L3X9ZPT6VZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this laptop about 3 weeks ago, and so far everything has been great.  The size is nice, with the LCD wide screen making it very enjoyable to watch movies on.  It's a pretty light laptop, at 5.something pounds and is very mobile for its size.  I really like the keyboard, with the regular sized 'Shift' button on the right hand side.  The battery life can last up to (and possibly a little over) 4 hours, depending on your chosen power settings.  It's got the built-in wireless card, that you can switch on and off whenever you want to use it.  The graphics for this computer are pretty good, and pretty much everything else is well over satisfactory.The only cons about this computer is the 512mb memory, but that can easily be upgraded, and all you need is another 512mb memory upgrade and you're set.  Also, the computer comes with a lot of unnecessary software and junk, but that problem can be solved by simply uninstalling whatever you don't want on there.  It can take a bit of time, though, depending on how much stuff you want to uninstall, but I didn't really mind it.Overall, I'd have to say this is a great laptop at a great price.","Date":"December 23, 2006"}

{"Title":"It was an OK computer before I broke it!","Author":"GNN Photography \"GNN\"","ReviewID":"R2WXSL9S2C6S4T","Overall":"good","Content":"Ok so my review will focus on how the laptop preformed before I broke the screen. To start out the laptop worked fine for basic activities like surfing the web, looking at pictures, or listening to your music library. But with the entry level amount of ram, and the cpu only being a single core, it lags with basic games like Sim City, and The Sims, and forget graphic intensive games like Flight Simulator's. It always got hot when doing basic stuff, thus the fan kicks into overtime to cool it down causing noticeable noise. The screen (before I cracked it)was very hazy, and the glare in the sun was terrible. Now moving on from the bad, the good things included a roomy keyboard with a very nicely located shift key (its great for fast typing). The battery was good with a two hour life span maybe two and a half if you're doing the basics. It came pre installed with a lot of useful software, that was a plus. All in all it fit my basic needs, but its limited hardware can set you back. I suggest a ram upgrade before you even set foot into the level of games, and streaming movies from Netflix, or Hulu.","Date":"May 23, 2012"}

{"Title":"Fantastic laptop","Author":"Guy in Fredericksburg, VA","ReviewID":"R38B20LPI092Z1","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great laptop.  First, let me say, I'm a software developer, so I'm very particular about my computers.  I was in the market for a new laptop.  After a lot of shopping around, I went with a laptop from HP for around $700.  It was my first PC with Vista, and it was frustratingly slow.  Here's an example... Put your laptop into sleep mode.  Come out of sleep mode, and how long does it take to connect to your WiFi network?  The HP laptop would take about 45 seconds while the macbook takes less than 5 seconds.  It's a small detail, but it's the tip of the iceberg.So, after I purchased my HP laptop, my wife bought a macbook.  I was so impressed, I took mine back and got my own macbook.  The battery is great.  I haven't timed it yet, but it's easily over three hours.  The LCD is great.  You don't get all that bloatware that comes with a new PC (like antivirus software that you can't seem to delete) that fills up your new hard disk.  And, there's no need to even worry about antivirus software since 99.9% of viruses are designed for Windows.As for performance, these macbooks are plenty zippy.  And, yes dual core does make a difference.  If you like to multitask (browse the web while playing mp3 music), then you'll notice the difference.  The user interface is more responsive during heavy loading.  Just for fun, I took a program I wrote for work and ran it on my new macbook.  (I won't bore you with the details of what it does, but it's CPU intensive.)  On the HP laptop, the program took about 13 minutes to run.  On the macbook, it took 3 min, 30 seconds.  Just for fun, I ran the same program on a fully loaded Dell 820 ($3000), and it finished in about 3 minutes.  So, I'm very pleased with the performance of this macbook.And, there are great open source (free) applications you can get for Mac OS X now.  So, I quickly installed Firefox, Thunderbird (email), NeoOffice (MS Office replacement), Chicken of the Sea (VNC client), XAMPP (Apache/PHP/MySQL), Transmission (BitTorrent), Burn (CD/DVD burner), and Eclipse (Java development).The only way they could improve this macbook would be to bundle the DVD writer in the entry-level model instead of a combo drive (CD writer, DVD reader).  It's not an issue with me since I have many other DVD writers on my LAN, but others may want to purchase the next model up that comes with the DVD writer.","Date":"August 30, 2007"}

And I'm impressed with how it all works together.As for this specific version of the macbook, I have found no problems at all, works beautifully as advertised. The only thing I found is that mabook's screen needs to be calibrated or adjusted. Don't settle for default screen profile, pictures will appear washed out. Calibrate screens settings; you should be able to get it pretty close to what it should be with just what macbook has in OS X.I also recommend buying this model, since it has a bigger harddrive, its worth it.

{"Title":"If it's been two years, this one is worth the plunge.--UPDATE. (Extend the warranty)","Author":"Samuel Chell","ReviewID":"R821ZWCA6TXB4","Overall":"good","Content":"[UPDATE: Written 18 months after the review below: Compared to my iBook this machine proved better built (on the outside), maintained a tighter-action keyboard, was noticeably faster--for 15 months, at which point the hard drive simply, suddenly, and unexpectedly, died.]  It's predecessor, the iBook, on the other hand, developed problems like letters disappearing from the keys of the keyboard along with the keyboard action becoming sloppy, loose, and chattery.  I'd rather replace a keyboard than a hard-drive any day, but I probably got my money's worth out of both machines (Apple's least expensive models).  If I had to do it again, I'd order the extended warranty plan with any Apple laptop.  It's expensive, and it's not guarantee (if Apple judges the damage due to the user's incorrect or inappropriate use of the machine), but if it's a laptop and it sees heavy use, the two extra years are probably worth the several hundred extra. (With desktop models I'm still inclined not to buy the extended warranty.)}I ordered my last small-screen iBook from Amazon just two summers ago.  As usual, my heavy touch started shorting out the keyboard, and I couldn't afford several weeks of down time.  Factor in the wait, the cost of repairs, and the improvements, and this 13\" MacBook from Amazon seemed the best way to go.It's about a hundred bucks more than the prior edition but worth it.  The screen is wider, sharper and brighter (though I had no complaints with the predecessor).  The speed of unloading internet pages is noticeably faster,  a time-saver. The magnetically attached power cord should save the user the cost of an Apple adapter or two (about $80 each time you snap the thin wire).  The keyboard area is larger, which is nice, though the different feel of the tracking area and right thumb-click (little play--it barely seems to go down) takes a bit of getting used to.I didn't need a built-in camera or remote control, but what can you do.  At least I was able to avoid the Superdrive (haven't found much use for DVD burning) and all the extras (and sales tax) they push if you buy from Apple Store.  This machine doesn't require any additional memory or RAM, unless you're a heavy duty movie editor/audio engineer.  It's a one-click purchase. I even took a pass on Apple's current iPod incentive (I still buy CDs, mostly from Amazon).Even as I type this review, I'm conscious that the keyboard has a tighter feel and is quieter than the previous model. It also gets around in the often cumbersome and sluggish MS Word more quickly than the comparable machine of only two years ago. A great little work horse, and the transfer of information from your old computer has never been easier (make sure you have a firewire cable handy).","Date":"July 24, 2007"}
{"Title":"Fast and Zippy","Author":"Andy \"Andy\"","ReviewID":"R3KFBUPAMQRE3Y","Overall":"good","Content":"I will try to give a unbiased and responsible review of this MacBook. As a college student I struggled with the decision between purchasing a Windows laptop or a MacBook, but due to all the horror stories out there about Vista imcompatibility and my previous Windows nightmares, I decided to give Mac a try. I don't regret it. The screen is glossy and beautiful, albeit the 13.3\" screen can make the font in programs (especially in instant messaging programs) a bit small. You can adjust the font to larger size in, say,  AIM, but then that would render the person you are talking to to receive ridiculously large font sizes from you as well. And, if you are new to MAC OSX, there is definitely a learning curve and an experimental phase, so you should be patient; fortunately, there are alot of MAC OSX tutorial sites on the web and resources as well. I love the fast fast FAST boot time (around 20 seconds!!!) from off to on. BRAVO!! And the 2.0 ghz processor is more than enough for me. The MacBook is also very very silent. One thing I don't like though is the mouse track pad. Even on the fastest sensitivity setting, it just doesn't keep up with my fingers. A bit annoying, but a problem that can be solved with an external USB mouse. Let's see how my MacBook holds up in the next four years.","Date":"May 25, 2007"}

{"Title":"My first Mac in a long time and a very pleasing product","Author":"Dion Hinchcliffe \"Itinerant traveler through ...","ReviewID":"R3COUCVP0O5G72","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using the Macintosh on and off for about 20 years but left for over 10 years to be a devoted Windows user.  Recent issues with Vista and increasing problems with run-time bloat, incredibly long startup times, malware, and endless updates with their associated mandatory and automatic reboots began to get me thinking about checking out the Mac again.  Particularly with my iPod and iPhone showing me how superior Apple products could be compared to the competition.So I bit the bullet and purchased my first Macintosh laptop, the new MacBook with glossy screen, dual core Intel processor, and a gig of RAM.  For the most part, the laptop has been a pure joy to use, is built with amazing solidity, and does what it's advertised to do.  However, since I use computers of all kinds all day, I have racked up a number of pros and cons for this mostly stellar new laptop product as I've used this MacBook (in gorgeous matte executive black) the last three weeks on a daily basis.PROS:- Amazingly fast boot time, about 20-30 seconds in my tests. Wayyy better than Windows.- Extremely solid construction and feel.- Elegant and compact power cord setup with the famous magnetic detach system to prevent annoying and damaging cord yanks.- Comes with lots of software and apps that really work.- Roomy storage and good overall performance.- Does not run too hot, even when performance settings are turned up.- Supports Bluetooth 2.0 and a lot of the newer, sexier Bluetooth profiles including A2DP and stereo headsets.- Big, bright, clear screen.- The built-in camera takes decent video and it works well with Skype.- With Parallels, runs Windows Vista Ultimate flawlessly so far, even with old apps, simultaneously with the Mac OS.- The feel of the latest Mac desktop seems brawny yet nimble with lots of seductive graphics, morphing windows, flip screens and more.  Makes it a joy visually.- Battery life is acceptable, not finding myself wanting a lot more juice frequently (though occasionally I do.)- Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection works surprisingly well to control and use Windows PC's remotely, a genuine pleasure since I usually work with 2-4 computers at a time, and I can just Alt-Tab between them from the MacBook.CONS:- User interaction often seems weirdly sluggish with a brief, unexplained pause when many common actions are initiated in applications.  Not significantly off putting, but strange for a system with two powerful CPU cores.- WiFi seems slow and inconsistent.  Not a lot of dropped connections, but slower for sure than my PC laptops.- Bluetooth stereo support is crude, with no automatic switching between internal and wireless speakers/mics.- The leading Mac apps (iLife, iWork, Mac Office) just aren't as stable as their Windows counterparts.  Not a lot less stable, but definitely noticeable and sometimes frustrating.- The trackpad and associated button feels heavy and ponderous and is tedious to use for long periods.  Definitely invest in the wireless Mac mouse for serious work, it works well.- Irritating sharp beveled edge on front of the case where your wrists rest.  All edges on the MacBook are smooth except for the one which you rest your wrists.  Careful placement and angling of MacBook can help, but seems inexplicable in terms of good design.- Screen has slightly uneven lighting, not enough to bother but Sony laptops run rings around the MacBook in terms of mind-blowing clarity and lighting consistency.- No extended battery available from Apple (that I know of), not good for serious business users.- No built-in WWAN support, had to buy something from Verizon that hangs off the side, another knock on business use of this product.- 1 GB RAM is not enough for serious daily use, I had to upgrade to 2GB to get things to work right, particularly with Parallels.For lighter family use, the current MacBook is more than ready for almost any computing task.  For serious business use, the MacBook is just barely there and requires some additional investment (mouse, WWAN, extra battery, Parallels) but that's true of many Windows laptops as well.One star is subtracted from a perfect score for the strange design shortfalls (average Bluetooth support, sharp edge on the front of the case, so-so trackpad, less than great app stability, less than zippy response of apps.)I would recommend this product to almost anyone however, the Macintosh has re-arrived on the personal computing scene for sure.  I hope you enjoy it!","Date":"August 21, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great for everything.... but not for spreadsheets","Author":"CKE","ReviewID":"R1RMLEFQFG4F0G","Overall":"good","Content":"I guess all Apple reviews eventually become a comparison between PCs and Windows to the virtues of Macs.  Most of us really only have these two options.... we can look at RAM, memory, processor speed and a variety of other indicators - but to be honest what characteristics really matters? Hopefully, this review can help make this as painless as possible for the non-tech savvy (The power users already have their preferences). By the way, I use both PCs and Macs during the course of the day, so I will give my opinion on the strengths and weaknesses.Apple - Strengths-  The Apple goes from \"off\" to \"surfing the internet\" in 15 seconds. It is truly amazing how fast it gets booted-up and ready to run.-  Video editing is a breeze - lots of power here.- Lack of viruses ...there are some... but not nearly as many as Windows based computers...an added benefit is that you don't have use \"Norton\" or \"McAfee\" and all of the annoying pop-ups that those programs provide.- Ichat... my wife is able to have a picture perfect video conference with her sister every night...even though they live 2500 miles a part. The best part? It is free!- Apple support is top-notch! You make an appointment at a store and they bend over backwards to help you! This is sooo much better than calling into some random help desk.- Quality of construction - sorry, I have had to many PCs die from hardware related issues over the last 5 years... Apple's seem to last forever.Apple - Weaknesses-Spreadsheets - It is true you can get a Mac version of Excel - but it is absolutely horrible. Things that you take for granted on Windows based Excel...i.e adding a comment in a cell are missing!- You can not buy (at least at the time of this review) music and videos on Amazon.com - they do not support Macs at this time.- Lack of programs in general. While there are many cool programs and games for PCs there are only a handful available for the Mac.- Attaching photos to email is not as easy as using a PC and Yahoo.- a 13.3\" monitor really is too small.My final recommendation? If you have to have ONE computer you probably want to strongly consider a PC. The  variety of programs and the power of spreadsheets have become critical to most of us.... especially for our jobs. However, if you need a computer simply for \"fun\" (not counting games) and surfing the internet the Apple is impossible to beat.If you need a computer for work or Video Games = PC/windowsIf you need a compuer for surfing the internet/photos/videos = Apple/MacOS","Date":"September 14, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great little notebook","Author":"Chones","ReviewID":"RYU88B7LP26H7","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my Macbook (MB) for about two weeks now and I have to say I love it, and I'll tell you why:1) Ease of use.  After you get over the PC to Mac unfamiliarity (it took me a day or so), you'll realize that everything on this MB is so much more user friendly than any PC/Notebook I've ever used.  For example, deleting items/programs off the computer.  There is no need to uninstall...just drag the item to the trash and bingo, the program is gone.  There is no registry in OS X to deal with.  Wireless connectivity is a breeze - just walk into a hotspot and a little window pops up asking if you want to connect.  That simple!  My previous laptop - Dell Insipiron - took some windows configuration which if you're new to wireless connectivity could take awhile to get used to.  Bluetooth comes standard and any device is automatically detected.  I have a BT mouse that I just turned on and the MB took care of the rest.  It was that easy -- so far I haven't had to deal with drivers and updating and the like.2. Security -- I am still a litle wary about this aspect of the MB, but no anti-virus software!  I have not yet (knock on wood) encountered any spyware/viruses whereas in PC, that is the first thing you have to contend with.  That is not to say Macs are not vunerable, but much less so than PCs from what I've read.3. It is sleek, light, and great looking.  Aesthetics aren't too important to me, but it is a plus.  The MB looks great and works well.  Not to mention its 1\" all around size.  It is slightly heavy, a little over 5lbs with the adapter.  Fits nicely in my school bag -- not much heavier than a 5 star notebook with about the same dimensions.4. Little things.  So you can probably get more functionality/customizibality from a Dell for at or just under the price of this MB.  But what the Dell probably won't offer is the little things. For example, the AC adapter comes in two parts - one much like the IPod adapter with two prongs for travel and then a three pronged extension when using at home.  The fast connectivity of this MB - I never have to turn it off/restart, I just close the lid and the its goes to sleep.  When I open the lid, the computer starts right up and picks up where I left off in seconds.  On that note, the use of magnets for the lid closure and power cord connector -- that is ingenious!  No latch to break, no hard cable connection to send your MB flying from the careless, unaware college kid. Installing applications -- just download app, an icon appears on your desktop, drag it to your applications folder and you are done.  There are many more little things that I could mention, but this review is turning out too long as it is.Bottom line:  I am very happy with this MB.  It is my first Apple Computer, and when my Dell XPS dies, I intend on replacing it with an Apple PC.  They just seem so much more user friendly.  I am not a computer whiz and the Mac seems to target the average user like me.  I love every aspect about this MB from the size, weight, design, to its functionality.  Switching from PC to MAC is really not that difficult and if you get stuck, just google whatever it is you need and someone somewhere has probably had the same question.  Most of the stuff is common sense.  Unlike some other users, I don't think the MB gets overly hot on my lap after many hours of usage.  The keyboard is flat and takes a bit of getting used to, but I love it.All in all, well worth the price.  I bought mine off the Apple store, used the student discount ($100 off), got a free IPOD.  Granted you cannot upgrade much on this machine (I got a larger HDD), so it won't replace a regular computer for gaming or serious graphic design.  If you want more value for your money - you're probably better off with something like a Dell.  But if you have the money (although it's not overpriced for compared to other notebooks in its class), and want a well thought out, nicely built machine - with very little headaches that are associated with PCs, you should get this MB.  You won't be disappointed!","Date":"August 24, 2007"}

Enger","ReviewID":"R306JBUNG4N4TA","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been a Mac gal for 20 years now, although I have to use a PC at work (but it can't hurt to know both platforms, right?). This is my second Mac laptop, replacing an original iBook from 1999, which is still working fine but can't accommodate enough RAM for OS X and things like Photoshop. The MacBook is lighter, boots up in record time (faster than the iBook and my work PC), and I love the glossy screen. OK, I do sort of miss the handle--no matter what people said about the iBook, that handle is helpful when you live in a house full of butterfingers.No complaints about battery life--I keep AirPort turned off when I'm not online--and I work in some pretty battery-draining programs, like iMovie, InDesign, and Photoshop. The MacBook handles them all with ease, and the big hard drive means I can keep multiple projects onboard and still have plenty of working room.Love Spotlight (the search widget) and Dashboard--my inner Steve Jobs really hates all sorts of aliases cluttering up my desktop and impinging on my wallpaper. Dashboard has a calculator and a dictionary/thesaurus for my son, and boatloads of free widgets are available at apple.com for the publishing geek (font management, project timers, etc.)Being somewhat new to OS X and using Windows XP at work, I wasn't sure how Tiger would handle cross-platform files, but I've imported wav and avi files and iTunes and iMovie read them without needing additional software for translation. If I want Windows on the MacBook, I can use BootCamp to have it run native, which would be a vast improvement over the adequate-but-slow PC emulation I had on the iBook under Virtual PC. Because I'd only need Windows to run spreadsheet software for hubby, I'm hoping iWork07 has the long-awaited spreadsheet program.Hooking the MacBook up to my ancient peripherals was a snap. Drivers for my 8-year-old inkjet printer were native to OS 10.4, and I was able to download free OS X drivers for my 8-year-old scanner and 15-year-old laserprinter.I'm very happy with my MacBook.

And it's probably a very reasonable amount, considering the features. What mates this model different?- If you've done the full installation, you can use both windows and Mac US, doubling the of applications available to you.- The speed is very fast for most applications, and standard use will provide a near-instantaneous use.And there are a few things that you may want to know before buying:- For demanding streaming video like Stage 6, you will need to upgrade the RAM from 1 to 2 gigs. Extra modules are available for under $50, and installation is remarkabably easy. Two gigs is your limit  for total RAM.- Heat is an issue for a number of users; certainly a cooler system increases wear. But at default, this model can be quite warm. That, too, isn't a major concern. The freeware smcfancontrol can bring the temperature to under 100ºF without significant fan noise.- Previous versions of Mac portables have been less than impressive from the standpoint of graphics quality. Ib this 13\" model, however, color is bright and and has very good detail. However, if you reduce brightness through the Control Panel, the image quality is close to a desktop system, and watching DVD movies is a pleasure.- This model has a battery life of well over four hours, though I try not to use the plug unless necessary. Save the battery entirely by uninstalling the battery.These tips help make this Macbook a special pleasure to use.","Date":"July 20, 2007"}

Not even refurbished laptops offers as much as this laptop ( Intel Duo Core processor 2.16, 1 Gig RAM, 120 Hard Drive). Don't believe me? Research it . I like how the system is more stable, and you don't have to worry too much about viruses. My biggest thing I really like is how the dvd burner is built in. you don't have to worry about breaking it when you open it. the system is fast to upload and shut down. The only thing I don't like is how dirt shows on it. It shows everything. It's a problem for me, because I'm in Iraq, and everything gets dusty. I bought a over to solve that problem. Also I recommend, buying the crucial 2gig RAM. It's cheaper than having apple do it for you, and simple to put in Just follow the instructions on the everything MAC. But for gamers good luck!

{"Title":"Great overall, but extremely disapointed battery life!","Author":"M. Long \"la la la\"","ReviewID":"R1PJUTZWBQDMTN","Overall":"good","Content":"This review is intended for current PC users who is thinking about getting a MacBook. I'll just point out some of the issues I have faced.I have been a PC user for 7 years. I'm using this MacBook for my college, and I have been using it for only a month.(Please be gentle, I will update my review later if anything changes)First thing that really bothers me is the battery life. I travel quite often, so battery life is a big deal to me. This MacBook claimed to have up to 6 hours of battery life, which is a lie!. In real life, it only last around 3 hours. Even I turned off bluetooth, wireless, dim the the screen, I might be lucky to get around 3.5 hours. If you run Macbook under Windows mode, the battery life drop to 2.5 hours. The only way you can get your macbook run for up to 6 hours is dimming your screen to darkest, not running any applications, and turning off wireless & bluetooth..Don't believe me? Go to different forums and search battery topics. My last laptop claimed to have up to 5 hours of battery life, which it did last around 4--5 hours even after 2 years.  If your previous laptop only have 1 or 2 hours of battery life, I guess 3 hours will be a little bit \"upgrade\" for you. On top of the short battery life, this macbook battery can get very hot, you can burn your lap if you put it there long enough.There are good things about Macbook. It is very easy to upgrade and install the memories. It only cost me around $60 to upgrade to 2GB ram, and I installed it very easily without much of an effort. The same configuration, Sony could easily cost around $2000, and macbook only cost $1300.I have always wanted a MacBook, because it is cute and stylish, but the Mac OS system always make me hesitated. I finally got it after I found out it also run windows now. It is very easy to install windows on MacBook with bootcamp. They suggest you to print out the instructions, which is not necessary, all you need to do is follow the instructions on screen.If you get used to using windows softwares, you will find many of them have very limited functions when under Mac OS, and sometimes they don't even have Mac version.The bootcamp I used was 1.3, it does have some incompatibility issues.The volume and brightness control keys, disk eject keys are not working under windows. I hope all these problems will be fixed in the future. Since there is no right click button, you have to use two fingers tap on the touch pad and click as right click. Some new MacBook users might have problems in the beginning.It is not hard to learn the Mac OS, and there are many great programs are specially designed for Mac. The office 2004 for Mac is great for college student, one of the function is you can record the lecture while you are typing down the notes.I strongly recommend this laptop. It works just like a regular laptop, but it can run in both of the world. :-PPS: the white macbook does get dirty easily, get Glass Plus Wipes, it will do the trick to make your laptop look new again. (test on a little corner first if you have doubts)(Sorry for my broken English, and sorry if I offended some mac lovers..)","Date":"June 21, 2007"}

First of all, the Superdrive is absoulutely necessary if you wanna back up your hard disk or big files... it's a little slow and bored to burn a lot of CD's with 700 MB, instead of a big DVD with 4,7 GB of capacity.2. The Intel-Based system is very fast, have a extremely quick start, and native software runs perfectly.3. The Intel Core 2 Duo is better than his first version. The Core 2 Duo, works colder, and doesn't have problems of unexpected shutdown. Very solid.4. The space in gigabytes of Apple software and applications it's simply a hassle, that's why I buyed this computer with a 80 GB hard disk, and when you open your laptop the first time, you can check with horrour only 56 GB available!! That's because you can see a lot of unnecessary Apple software that uses a total of 17 GB of your precious hard disk space. The solution? I re-installed Mac OSX from the DVD, erasing the whole hard disk, and simply I \"personalized\" what software I really need to use, so, I unchecked all the unecessary language packs, printer for all drivers, garage band, and some useless software, and finally, I get a lovable 3,5 GB Mac OSX and a 70 GB free... perfect.5. Mag-safe technology, simply comfortable.6. The 13\" with 1280 x 800 resolution, it's very bright, clear and you can \"see\" everything.I recommend this computer for people who wants an easy-to-use system, and enjoy it without thinking in virus, patches and worms like another operating systems.","Date":"July 26, 2007"}

I also use and own a Desk top Mac and I use the macBook as my walk around the house and backyard computer.  I have wi-fi and can use  the computer to wirelessly acess the net.  I did not have any problems setting the computer up.  It does everything for you.  The MacBook is light, easy to carry and very functional.  I use it to edit my photos, check and compose my email, and video conference with my family from various locations around the house or when I am in the field shooting Pics.  It's easy to carry and use in the field for photography and down loading your images.  The AC adaptor is ingenious and helps in preventing injury to this computer. I like the black model but settled for the white because it doesn't show finger printsor smudges easily. The screen and the screen colors are clear &  beautiful but if you are farsighted get a larger screen.  The  glare on the glossy screen has been reported to be a problem however I haven't had any viewing problems.  You can create  beautiful movies, photos slide shows, albums, lettes, brochures or just rule the world (yours) with this computer. It comes with all the softwear you need.  The included softwear like Garage Band,  iDVD, iphoto and all the rest of the included softwear works seamlessly together and is astounding to say the least.  It is a fine instrument compared to other portable (PC's) in this price range and it can be used as a PC if you so desire.  Battery life is okay.  I've had it on my lap for an hour now- warm not hot.  Keyboard is nice and springy.  I would have like to have had the backlit key board though.

{"Title":"MacBook - Info on CD drive","Author":"Amaz Trend","ReviewID":"R39GB6GPDHZSYC","Overall":"good","Content":"I resubmitted a correction to Amazon for the drive speed of the CD (they have it as 6x and it is much faster) listed under the Apple laptop (ASIN: B000L48Z02), because I bought the computer and ran my own test.  It wrote at 3.4 MB/s instead of the 3.6 MB/s (which is 24x) so that is close enough.  I assume the top speed is under \"ideal conditions\" anyway and my hard drive was 3/4 full.  6x is more like 0.9 MB/s.  The manufacturer specs do say that the DVD read speed is 8x (from Apple:  Slot-loading Combo drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW): reads DVDs at up to 8x speed, writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed, writes CD-RW discs at up to 16x speed, reads CDs at up to 24x speed)Since Apple tends to give only a few options, and I can't find a single example anywhere of a 6x version, I assume that Amazon is wrong on the title.  In all fairness, since I did not check the speed of the DVD, a real world measurement might make that close to a 6x, but that is not the common way to rate the drive speed and I doubt Amazon did such a test and decided to publish only the precise values for the DVD.So far, for the few days I have it, the computer is great.  I like it as much or in some ways better than my work MacBook Pro 15\".  Running Windows is frankly distasteful, and you easily see why I stick to the mac side as much as possible, but Parallels makes it as easy and stable as it can be. This MacBook ran it with no noticeable speed difference. I love the no-latch closure in the front (much easier to open).  The built-in camera is very helpful and kids think that the funny software it comes with is a blast.  My bluetooth mouse was found with no trouble.I need to get use to the ports all being on the left side and the CD on the right compared to the MacBook Pro.  Also it feels about as heavy but is noticeably smaller when carrying it around.  The sound is as loud and clear as the MacBook, yet the speakers are not visible. My only complaint is the modem is not internal and is a $50 extra. That comm method may be on the way out in the long run, but it was a big mistake in my mind by Apple.  I still have an old external USB floppy drive that works with the machine.  Now that is backwards compatibility!Update: After having it for 7 months, I have to report that it is absolutely wonderful and my wife, who does not like computers, finds it very useful and easy to use.","Date":"June 8, 2007"}

{"Title":"MacBook MB062LL/A","Author":"RamenNoodle \"RamenNoodle\"","ReviewID":"R1CUVLMA30JT3L","Overall":"good","Content":"The newest revision to the Apple MacBook mid-range model is a solid buy and a decently equipped machine.  Amazon delivered a zero-defect machine to me within the promised 2-day shipping deadline for a very reasonable price, which is par for the course with Amazon in my experience.  The rebate program makes this about the lowest cost for these machines on the web  (you can currently get a $75 mail-in rebate from MacMall on this machine plus some 'extras', but for me the ease of the on-line Amazon rebate and the decent customer service they provide in case of a problem outweighed the few extra incentives from the MacMall folks).The machine itself comes with all you need to get going, but a ram upgrade will definitely boost the performance, particularly if you are running Parallels or VMWare to use Windows in a virtual machine configuration.  For those of you who may be considering a purchase directly from Apple in order to customize your system configuration, take a careful look at the cost of purchasing extra RAM or HD upgrades from a third party and installing the hardware youself.  You'll most likely receive your machine faster, both RAM and HD upgrades on this machine are 5-10 minute jobs, and the cost-savings over a custom configuration from Apple is substantial.  The only caveat being that any damage you cause to your system performing RAM or HD upgrades is not covered by the Apple warranty.Choosing the base model (2.0 Ghz. Combo Drive) vs. this model (2.16 Ghz. Superdrive) was for me the most difficult decision to make.  The extra Mhz. that the 2.16 Ghz. processor delivers is essentially unnoticeable in real-world performance.  So the primary consideration seems to be, is the DVD burning capability worth the extra $200?  The Combo drive can be upgraded by some 3rd party companies, but unlike the RAM or HD is NOT an easy job.  For me the extra cost was worth it for the occasional need to burn large files to DVD when away from my primary machine, YMMV.As with all laptops, these machines are more prone to failure than the desktop hardware, and will be more costly to fix should they break, so I would highly recommend purchasing Applecare for this product for the additional 2 years of hardware warranty it provides.","Date":"June 25, 2007"}

I am a recent convert to Mac and treated myself to the 17 inch MacBook Pro when I first opened my small business earlier this year.  I liked it a lot so bought myself this small 13 inch to use at home and to carry on business trips.Well, I soon found myself completely attached to this smaller machine.  It is lightweight and has a battery that lasts an impressively long time. I can carry it anywhere and be set up to go in a flash, wherever there is a wireless connection.  And the speed of the wireless is terrific!  I also purchased an Airport Extreme and am now running my home network through its new, faster n standard.I have an old digital camera that was a huge hassle to use with Windows.  I had to download software and there were always glitches when I tried to upload photos from the camera card.  Now, with the MacBook's iPhoto, no software is necessary.  I just plug the camera into the laptop via a USB connector and the software does the rest.  I had pretty much given up on digital photography, but now find that I am using the camera a lot and easily sharing pictures with friends over the Web.The only drawback to this laptop is that it gets quite hot when it's in use for awhile.  (I've noticed that happens with my MacBook Pro too, as well as with other laptops I've had. But the Pro doesn't present a problem because I don't use it on my lap because it's a bit too large for comfort).  So I purchased a lightweight, insulated lap pad and now I have no problem keeping the MacBook on my lap for hours.I am incredibly enthused about the 13 inch MacBook and highly recommend it to everyone.  It is a great value for the price.  I only wish I had converted to Mac sooner.","Date":"September 28, 2007"}
{"Title":"happy recent mac convert!","Author":"K. Swanke","ReviewID":"R3QJ5MD0JF9MX5","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently gave my Dell Inspiron to my parents and bought a macbook after harboring much antagonism towards Macs.  My frustration with Windows' reliability and the testimonials of a couple of friends who recently converted to macs inspired me to spring for one, and life has been much better since!  I love the mag power cord, the compact size of it (although I was worried about the small screen size -- which has proved only difficult when reading and typing in word, so I just use the zoom feature and set it at 150%), and the great programs including dashboard and ilife suite.  I installed office for mac and have found it to be a great improvement over office for windows.One day I got real confused over how to uninstall a program I had installed and changed my mind about.  I kept trying to look for a \"add/remove programs\" in the system preferences menu, but couldn't find one.  Finally, after asking my roommate, I learned that all you have to do is drag the program icon from the finder onto the trash icon!  It took care of everything automatically.  I didn't believe the fix would be that quick, so I found a forum online, and indeed, it was that easy.  Microsoft had trained me that these matters are complex.  Apple simplifies them.My other worry was that I wouldn't like the keyboard, but I think I like it either just the same or better than those with beveled-edge keys.  The programs work pretty well with each other, the mail program and address book feature is fantastic (especially for downloading v-cards), and the photo booth program is incredibly fun and addictive.  My only complaint (that I share with a couple of my friends) is that the iphoto program is confusing and cumbersome for organizing your photos.  I miss just creating folders for events in Windows, and haven't yet taken a lot of time to figure out the best way of grouping my pictures so that they're consistent in the finder (the windows \"my computer\" counterpart) and in iphoto.  In its defense, though, it's real easy to modify pictures through iphoto, and I like that feature.all in all, I would definitely recommend converting to mac if you're typically a windows user, it's both pretty painless and very enjoyable.","Date":"November 25, 2007"}

The iLife suit can is included with this machine, which includes iphoto, iweb, imovie, and garage band (don't use that much).  Safari web browser is second to none.  Explorer always gave a distorted, over the top look and feel when surfing the web.  Safari shows exactly what you need, with very easy configuring if necessary.

Overall great product, if you still use window pc's like me at work or at home, mac virtually converts everything, so their should be little difficulty adjusting.  Some improvements I would like to see apple make are boosting up the gigs on this thing.  At this point 120 and up should be the standard.  Also, .Mac, although a very good user interface and emailing setup, is a little expensive.

{"Title":"Cool laptop, but a couple issues","Author":"John","ReviewID":"R2THUA7TBENXSD","Overall":"good","Content":"Ok. Let's just get it out of the way right now: yes, it is cool, yes the Unix-based operating system is good. Yes, it is virus-free. In other words, it has a lot of things that other laptop makers can't claim.And yet: I have had mine 8 months, and increasingly, I have to end sessions because I get the \"spinning beachball of doom\", indicating that RAM is being hit (i.e. is processing and I can't do anything). I went into the Apple store and they told me it was not spyware, but \"you have too many sessions open at once\". And yet, it happens when I have one single session open. To be fair, I am not 100% sure that this is Apple's fault. It could be something else that I don't see right now. But it didn't used to happen. I hate ending sessions with the \"beachball of doom\".Another issue is battery life: for instance, I often leave my MacBook with 50 % power. When I turn it on the next morning, it is dead and I have to start back at 0 %. Why ?Battery life seems to be the achilles heel for Apple, on most of their products.Thus: 3 stars.","Date":"August 12, 2007"}

Wegener told me they reinstalled the operating system, but when I went onto Facebook, the computer still had my email address and password stored on it. How could they have reinstalled the system when my passwords are still stored on it? Very bad experience. I lost almost $300 on this computer.

I know it is used and obviously won't be in brand new condition but i didn't know the battery sucked and the top of the computer (screen part) was so unstable. I can not have the laptop unplugged for more then 15 minutes without needing the plug to charge the computer because the battery sucks and will say it is charged most of the way when 2 minutes later can be on 10%. the top of the computer where the screen is, is not the sturdiest and it bugs me i didn't know about these details when trying to find the most accurate price for a decent computer in better condition. i'm very disappointed and will not buy another used computer again.","Date":"July 25, 2012"}

{"Title":"The Little Black Mac That Could","Author":"Martin Meinerz","ReviewID":"R116VE13WY5WN0","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this computer mainly for college and I love it. I go to an art school down in Chicago, and every person that I talked to that has ever owned a Mac said that they are much better with artistic things that a PC. Its true! I use my computer for photoshop as well as a couple animation programs and its as fast as a bullet. Alot of people get turned off when they see that is has only 1GB of RAM, but keep in mind that if you get any PC with Windows Vista, Vista is sucking almost 1 GB just running. I found that the transition from a PC to a Mac was not that hard at all. I was an avid PC fan that even ridiculed and hated Apple products. After my first 10 minutes with this computer I was hooked. Macs can go from off to surfing the web in 30 seconds. Also everything that you do one your PC can be done on a Mac in about 5 less steps and in half the time. The thing I love most about this Macbook however is it has a slightly bigger hard drive than the regular white Macbook. Before this I had a semi-top of the line 15\" ASUS with a high resolution screen and all the bells and whistles one could ever want with a laptop. Don't get me wrong Asus also makes  a great computer, but this little Black Mac has changed me forever from a PC-anti-Mac-Man to an Apple Fan-For-Life! I would recommend this computer to every college student or artist ever that wants a Mac, but doesn't want to pend the $2000 on the Macbook Pro.","Date":"February 15, 2008"}

Dhesi \"digital hippy\"","ReviewID":"R2ZIB7RVZYPQDK","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been researching for a couple of months about getting a new laptop since my current one I have owned for about four years.  I went through all the Sunday ads and specials, went to Dells website, and then compared their prices and features to Apple's Macbook line.  What I found out was that the Macbook actually saved me $200 or so when compared to other laptops that feature the Core 2 Duo processor.  I could have spent $500 on a Windows laptop but the features would not come close to the Macbook.  The Core 2 Duo processor is amazing; the Macbook boots very fast and so do the applications.  The built in webcam is fun to mess around with and I like the power of the built in wireless network as well.  Also, most Windows laptops do not offer a DVI port but the Macbook allows you to use  DVI with an option $20 adaptor - this was another thing that sealed the deal for me.  I have an HD LCD TV and a Samsung DVI LCD and I would like to use either one of them with my laptop.  The screen is glossy and crystal clear.  The laptop is light - only weighs six pounds.  If you are going to buy a laptop, look around and compare because in the end the Macbook wins.","Date":"July 22, 2007"}

Couldn't be happier.Everything functions very well. Upgraded to 2G RAM, and it is very snappy. I use a third party bluetooth mouse with it, install went flawlessly, and it works like a champ. Keyboard has wonderful feel/action to it.My only gripe(which may be fixable,but I haven't found a solution) which is that the USB ports will stop functioning when book is closed. It is really just a minor irritation, but does affect my iPhone should I leave it plugged in to charge.Overall it does everything well, mail, web, etc. Wife liked it so much she took it over, so I got a iMAC 24\" !There are a few applications that haven't been developed as extensively(or at all) for Apple/MAC so you may wish to dual boot/boot camp it for those windows must have apps.Came with OS-X 10.4.10 will be upgrading it shortly to OS-X 10.5. If the iMAC is any indication, it should function a bit nicer after the upgrade. Leopard is a nice upgrade.I would recommend this to anyone thinking about an Apple notebook.","Date":"October 27, 2007"}

You will not be disappointed. It is well worth the purchase.

This will be our first Mac, but we use Iphones, so I don't think the transition will be too difficult.  The computer does not come with Microsoft Office, but most new computers only come with a trial offer anyway.  Also, apparently Apple makes something like Office, only cheaper, and made specifically for Mac.  I read all of the reviews for this product and this seller, and they all seemed to be great minus a few about bad battery life... Mine came fully charged, and seams to be in perfect working order.

I was originally a windows person but my dell laptop s*** out on me. so I figure why not try out a mac. I'm really hesitant on buying things that cost a lot of money but I knew refurbished are considered to be almost better than new because all of the software kinks have been worked out. I got this knowing that when I bought it there could be some physical impairments. And there were but nothing that effects the computer and nothing really noticeable. Battery life is mediocre but I could replace the battery for pretty cheap if I needed to. Also, my favorite part about this computer is that where the H key is supposed to be there is a U key. They offered to send me an H key but I didn't mind/don't want to deal with the hassle of changing the key. I thought it was pretty amusing.

Nearly every common operation takes longer in finder than exlorer, many operations and configurations are as far from 'intuitive' as anything in Windows (much further in some cases).  Yes the O.S. is more stable (just), but can't say the same for much of the software - and the lack of good quality, free software is disappointing (even good quality paid software is harder to find).I've been using it for about 6 months now so it can't just be lack of familiarity.  There are so many areas in which OS X is flawed or lacking compared to Windows that I can only conclude that the mac's reputation for usability is pure bluff and hype.  The thing that's saved the macbook for me is installing vmware fusion so that I can run XP on it.  Could have got a really sweet Windows-based notebook for the price though!","Date":"November 9, 2007"}

Dalfonso","ReviewID":"R3UNQ081VZIBOI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have been a long long time Apple supporter and have always recommended Apple over PC to everyone who asks my opinion - including my daughter.  However, recently I have not been so fast to do so.  A little over a year ago I convenience my daughter to spend her hard earned money on a MacBook.  What a mistake. She is on her third one, which has now this morning frozen up and according to the people at Apple on the phone sounds like the hard drive is gone.  If so, they want $900 to replace.  Now when people ask me about Apple all I can say is - My daughter has had 3 models in a little over a year and all three have had hard drive problems and on top of that Apple's support has been pretty much worthless - so you do the math.  I was waiting to order a new powerbook for my self when they finally introduce Leopard but I have to admit this once good Apple seems to be rotting.","Date":"August 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Don't buy MacBook","Author":"George K. Rogers","ReviewID":"R19Z72G3CWSMQU","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've been an everyday computer user since the 80s and have always, until now loved MacIntosh.  I have not always had them, for example because I use computers issued by my workplace, but when possible Mac's what I've had off and on over the years.  About a year ago I bought a Macbook and Applecare protection plan as a gift for my college-bound son.  The computer has not been troublesome until recently, although I found myself wondering why a $1300 (plus plus plus) Macbook was any better than the $500 Dell I use at work. Experience over the last month has soured me on ever buying another Apple product ever.  The problem is in customer support.  The Macbook broke down (or was inadvertly damaged), which I thought would be a simple matter to diagnose, relate to the warranty, and correct...even if not covered by the warranty.  The first trip by my college age son to the Apple store produced advice from the Apple technician to send it somewhere else due to expected delays and difficulties---better to pay someone else to fix it than to deal with Apple...despite having the expensive Applecare extended service plan. This without any real diagnosis of the problem.  So we took it to Comp USA, listed on the Apple website as an authorized Apple repair center. To make a long story short, Comp USA completely fumbled after charging me $100 for data recovery, which it turned out can not be done with voiding the Applecare warranty. (The authorized technicians at Comp USA were unaware of this.) They never did the data recovery, and I had to return to the store and wait in a long line to get a refund.  It turned out that there is virtualy no provision for data recovery when Macs go down (perhaps it can be done by paying a minimum of $500 to an outside service). Okay, backing up is the customer responsibility.  After the computer sat in the authorized service center unrepaired and un-sent to Apple for over a week, with the technician there lying that it had been \"sent to Apple,\" I finally went to that store to pick it up.  I took the computer again to the Apple store to drop it off to be sent for repair, only to find out that to drop off a malfunctioning computer requires an appointment---and they specify the time.  So now yet another trip to the Apple store. Too bad if you're supposed to be at work during all these trips.  Counting that,  a routine malfunction, still unresolved has caused me (or my son) five trips through heavy traffic to absolutely nowhere.  In the meantime, my son who needs the computer for college work, has been computerless for almost a month and counting. Everything about this experience has been stupid, rude, wasteful, and frustrating. This from a company that charges a premium price for its products and absolutely needs customer loyalty.  Whether the computer merely malfunctioned or has suffered trauma, I do not know.  I can live with either conclusion.  The point is with Apple it has been impossible to even get ANYWHERE on this problem despite extensive efforts. I'd suggest looking at other computers.","Date":"September 10, 2007"}

And it shows, at least in some aspects of the machine. The processor is fast, the machine is compact, light and slick-looking, while Mac OS X is rock-stable.The keyboard is my real gripe; 2 days old and the it needs to be replaced as the \"chicklet keys\" are wobbly and the click-bar below the track pad is variably responsive at the edges. Oils from one's hands can smudge the polycarbonate case but the avidity of dirt is less an issue with the black model. The glossy screen is sharp with great color saturation but the glare from it in brightly lit rooms is somewhat distracting. On the whole it is a solid machine for a competetive price but if you can spare the $350-500 differential, check out the new 15\" LED-backlit Macbook Pro's, particularly if you're a heavy user and prefer the better keyboard action of the higher-end models.ADDENDUM:The keyboard was swapped under warranty and the experience is far improved. Keys, track pad and buttons are as they should have been to start. While my estimation of the machine has risen, the new Macbook Pro is still is worthy of the extra expense.","Date":"June 13, 2007"}

Childcare \"Child Care Guy\"","ReviewID":"R3JCWFHB2M1MD4","Overall":"good","Content":"I have found the transition from Windows XP to Mac OS X to be slow and frustrating. For me the Mac has been frustrating and highly NON-intuitive.  I hate Windows-based computers, for their unreliability and frequent crashes. But I actually miss Windows XP when I want to download specific photos from my camera;  burn a CD ROM or a DVD, with items chosen from various folders;  or edit my web site.  The Macbook efficiently and reliably does what it wants to do, but not what I want to do. Even when I have expert advice from experienced Mac users, I find the computer to be recalcitrant.  I tried to present a simple basic slide show, and we needed to turn off the music and special effects half a dozen times.  I expect my Mac to be reliable, and I must admit it has only crashed once in two months. Eventually, when I have learned OS X, I may love my Mac. The display is beautiful. For now however, the path is long and slow.","Date":"October 10, 2007"}

Boy was I wrong. The problems I've had getting online with the laptop are enough to make anyone scream. Macbooks basically don't work well at all with routers. If you are hardwiring (ethernet cable) to your broadband modem or whatever then you're probably fine. Dont' take my word for it though. Go check the discussion board on Apple's website under macbook and internet connectivity. You'll find thousands of other disgrunted buyers who have had major problems connecting to wireless routers.  In addition, my macbook has 2GB of RAM. I had an extra gig added at my own expense. I thought this would make my mac much faster than my Dell Inspiron which has 1.24 GB of RAM. Again, I was mistaken. My Dell is still somehow faster and it's running on Windows XP with a 1.7 Ghz processor.  Also, if you need to use other software products like Excel, Windows Media (to download and play videos), or Shockwave from Macromedia...good luck to you. I have had nothing but problems getting these programs to work at all and when I've been able to get add on software to work well it still doesn't have the ease of functionality as my Dell.  To be honest I'm very surprised to find all these problems with my Macbook. I assumed that all I had heard about Macs was true and that's why I made the switch. At this point I'm sorry I switched and I wrote this review with my Dell.","Date":"November 22, 2007"}

I tried this unit for a couple days and i have to say i did'nt like it. for one thing the palm rest gets very hot and emanates and uncomfortable electromagnetic radiation on your hands or on your lap if you keep it there, very similar to \"cell phone ear\" for some reason that bugged me my pc laptop does not do that i beleive because of the thin size of this notebook the hotness is a trade off , i did'nt like the keyboard either , now onto a completely newer operating system , granted i never really took the time to fully learn it but my impression of it is this, it is supposed to be intuitive and more user friendly than windows, i think it is dumbed down , furthermore i think that windows is great if you have it working well, the advantage that this apple has supposedly is that it is less prone to bugs virus's crashes and things of that nature. All in all after using it for a couple days i really missed computers and decided to return it, i am now shoppng for a new pc laptop. Alot of the stuff apple gives you is based around photo's music and movies , which is kinda nice in  way but i still feel that apple is a niche product and that there is a reason why 90% of people still use windows based pc's. windows may not be perfect but it is a universally usable product that is the best way to use the internet among other things. And apples are'nt exactly cheap either. And there is still alot of stuff like peripherals and programs that don't work for apple os , even though apple is growing alot of stuff is still left out for apple users.

Attempts to rig iCalendar and iAddress bookl to syncwith the Palm Pilot did not go well.Word, Excel, Acrobat Professional and Endnote were far slower on a brand new MacBook than they were on a PC purchased two years ago for much cheaper. This probably reflects the general trend for companies to put far less effort into Mac programs than PC ones (supply and demand).OSX has great looks and graphics capabilites, but I was unimpressedwith the basic functionality. For example:anchored highlighting is ludicrousswitching between tasks is much less efficient than on a PC, wherealt-tab really does the job (I tried a freeware utility called\"Witch\", but it functioned very slowly)I suppose I could have invested more time and money in trying more Macnative software (DevonThink, Scribner, Bookends, Pages, etc), butsince I need to be interoperable with the rest of the world--and likegetting things like the new version of google, I found it moreefficient to cut my losses and switch back.I do miss the streamlined design of the MacBook, and its greattrackpad, with the two-fingered double click and scrolling.

It was advertised as a completely perfect computer with no flaws and arrived looking as such. Everything seemed fine, but a few days ago -- just a little over 3 months since the date of purchase -- the computer abruptly shut down on me, and continued to do so each time I used it. After troubleshooting with the phone agents (for which, by the way, I had to pay a ridiculous $50 because my 3-month-included phone plan ran out...by mere days), I was able to fix the shutdown problem, but now the computer will not run without the power chord. It does not turn on without the power chord. At all.I am deeply shocked and disturbed that a product like this would break down so quickly. I have never experienced anything like this before, with any kind of electronic. I was told by the agents that I will have to get the harddrive replaced, which is a real headache.So I just keep asking myself why I ever bought this thing.Laptops are NOT Apple's forte. If you are determined to buy an apple product, stick to desktops. You might find that you get lots of unnecessary headaches with your macbook. Don't be fooled by its cute look and speed.

What was a seemingly fair deal turned out to just be, \"you get what you pay for\". A little suspect that the drive works for a few hours and then dies. Not making accusations that he is a crook, however he does have to make a profit somewhere. Sold me junk, I could have got off a popular auction site for about $30, I thought Amazon would have some integrity as it is sold through them...guess I was wrong. Buyer beware.Overall would rather buy from someone else, however, with some tweaking and a lot of know how, this being the second day, I think I have things worked out. All this seller does is buy used laptops off the internet, set them up with an SP3 back-up disk he has and ship them out to you...for better or for worse....","Date":"June 16, 2010"}

I was looking for a portable pc to use at home or anywhere for my home business as a freelance artist. I needed a computer that would run all my programs, hold my files, and got access to the internet, along with other things like usb and earphone attatchments. In terms of minor damage such as scratches etc., I was only missing a couple of the rubber feet from the bottom. Runs fast, good memory & storage, Windows XP is great, much easier to use than windows 7. It came with a working power cord, and has a fairly long battery life (so far about 5-8 hours depending on what I'm doing. I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a computer under $200. And because I know no one wants to go through the hassle of ordering a computer to find out it doesn't work, having to return it, etc.; I would also say this is a valid seller; I actually needed to contact him through email, and he was quick, accurate, and helpful.","Date":"May 28, 2012"}

We emailed 5 Star electronics often and always got a response but not thinking of the postal situation in the northeast we wanted it now.  The more impatient I got the more paranoid I became and filed a claim for not recieving the computer.  Soon after customer service called and let me know the status of the order and when I was told at the beginning of the week I was told it would be here friday, today is saturday and the laptop arrived in good used condition, completely restored to factory defaults and good programs already installed.  My daughter loves it and if you're like me and have very little patience I recommend you call them their customer service is fantastic and I can't find my keys on sunny days and 5 star is still business operational with little delivery support and a waterlogged state.

{"Title":"Awesome Laptop","Author":"SClark","ReviewID":"R2BERILAEZ6A0S","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased one of these back in 2007 and it is still running strong.  Yes there is a video card issue with them.  They need to be on flat free from debris, table clothes, and other stuff that will limit air flow.  I have only had to bake my video card once and replaced the thermal pads on the CPU and GPU with artic silver with no further issues.  Also get the I8K GUI software to control your fans and monitor your CPU and GPU so you know when it is time to service it yourself.  This laptop is highly serviceable and the documentation has always been available from Dell.  The only downside is that you do need to clean it and replace the thermal paste periodically due to the amount of heat that is created from running this powerhouse.  I recommend replacing the hard drive with a Solid state unit since it is blazing fast then and extends the battery time to something realistic.  The standard battery time while gaming is only 45 min due to the awesome graphics and processing.","Date":"January 5, 2013"}
{"Title":"Great machine from a not so great company","Author":"Daiho","ReviewID":"R2CIU0TH6E3T9H","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this computer from Dell in 2007.  At the time it was one of the most powerful laptops available and retailed for approximately US$3000.  I have carried it across the world and used it in Japan, Nepal, India, Thailand, the US, and now in the Middle East.  I am still using it today.Like hundreds of others, mine suffered from the poorly installed graphics card, but fortunately this didn't cause serious trouble until this year, when I had to have the card remounted.  Dell does not provide this service and will not tell you how to do this.  Nor will they sell you a reasonably priced replacement graphics card, as they are keeping what they have for computers still under warranty.The only other problem I've had is the loss of both power sources.  Batteries quite naturally have a short shelf life, but I've never had a AC power source burn out on any appliance I've ever owned.  Only on this Dell.  And getting a replacement was a bit of a hassle as this machine uses a bit more current than your average computer.Otherwise, this has been a wonderful machine.  On balance, it has provided far more hours of productivity and entertainment than it has hours of frustration.#","Date":"November 24, 2011"}

They had fantastic customer service and took care of me no problem after some security questions were asked.  This one arrived and it was fantastic from the beginning.  It still has served me well though the military, medical school and graduate school, as well as being a pretty high end gamin machine.  It does relatively well even today, though for gaming it is now underpowered; for anything else it is still great.  This laptop is one of the best and most reliable; I've updated it to windows 7 x64 and the RAM to a full 4G to keep it as current as possible.This is a great machine and I will gladly buy from Dell again - in fact I'll probably stick to high-ends and get an alienware from them in the next year or two.","Date":"January 16, 2011"}
{"Title":"Dell's Poor Customer Service and Poor Accountibility","Author":"Christophe J. Houseman","ReviewID":"RI3FIY3PUY5QG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had really enjoyed my Dell XPS M1730.  One day the LCD panel started having problems.  I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat.  They had me run a series of lengthy diagnostics.  These diagnostics did not find any problems.  The problems with the LCD panel continued.  I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat again.  After 3 seperate lengthy chats they authorized that the display adapter be replaced.In a few days a contracted service technician (authorized by Dell) came to my home and replaced the display adapter.  This did not alleviate the problems with the LCD panel.  After the technician performed the service on the computer the FN key on the keyboard ceased to function.  I contacted Dell Technical Support via chat once again.  They authorized the same technician to replace the keyboard on one visit and he replaced the LCD panel on a 3rd visit.Replacing the LCD panel resolved the specific issues I was experiencing with the LCD, however the new LCD panel had a number of new issues.  The original LCD panel which came with the computer was a Sharp. This Sharp LCD panel had no issues until about 10 months after I had purchased the computer.  The LCD panel which was installed to replace the Sharp is an LG.  This LG LCD panel has very bad backlight bleeding, extremely slow response time and a purple blemish in the bottom left corner.  These issues make the computer unbearable to use.  The original Sharp LCD panel did not experience any of these issues.I contacted Dell Techical Support via chat once again.  They had me send it to the Dell Depot in Houston, Texas.  The chat technician verified that the LCD would be replaced with a Sharp LCD panel that did not experience these issues and be free of defects.  I sent the computer to the Dell Depot using the box that Dell had shipped to me.  Included in the box was a sheet of paper which listed an area to describe the problems with the computer.  I listed the problems in great detail, including the problems with the LCD display.When I received the computer back none of the issues I detailed had been addressed.  The LCD panel had not been replaced.  Only now the computer would not boot from the hard drive.  Something had happened while the computer was at the Dell Depot which caused the BIOS to not recognize that a hard drive was installed.  Now I could not use the computer.Since the computer is not functional I am not able to work.  This is a computer I use for work.  I have and will continue to lose a great amount of productivity due to this problem.I contacted Dell Technical Support via phone and explained to them what has happened.  I spoke with a first level technician and his supervisor.  The only things they said they would do is send out another technician to replace the LCD, motherboard and hard drive.  None of these items would need to be replaced if the LCD was replaced at the Dell Depot like it should have been and if it did not get damaged at the Dell Depot.All Dell is doing is stating that they will do something in the future which should have already been done.  They are not taking any responsibility for the problems they have caused me by not fixing the computer correctly the first time, or the second, or the third...etc.  They did not even state that they would send out the correct LCD panel, so they may still install an inferior LCD panel to the one which was originally installed.","Date":"September 6, 2008"}

It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size.  It's held up very well.  One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap.  No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook.  In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review.

I expected that since it was used, even though it was described as \"like new\" there may be a few barely noticeable scuffs, etc.  However, this iBook had MANY scuffs and scratches, it is badly scratched and scuffed.  To be honest, I would not have purchased it if it were described  in any way OTHER than \"like new.\"  So I feel their description of the iBook was misleading.

It is much smaller than many of the PCs operating on the MSDos systems.  It has plenty of speed, plenty of memory and is very easy to use.  It is so lightweight and easy to carry with you that it has advantages over some of the larger, heavier laptops.  I own a very nice PC laptop, but, it is larger and heavier.  The little iBook G3 is so light and small that I often take it instead.  The computer arrived quickly and in good shape.  There was information included in the package for support.  The newer models are indeed faster and do have more RAM, but I only paid about 14% of the cost of these newer models for the older, yet very capable iBook G3.  I am thinking about purchasing another one for my colleagues to use in the field.  I also purchased covers for the computer at Amazon and they were a fraction of the cost listed elsewhere.","Date":"April 24, 2011"}

{"Title":"awesome portable workhorse","Author":"Buyin Guy \"The mac fixer guy\"","ReviewID":"R3GZ5HMPIE4HMF","Overall":"good","Content":"This iBook G4 GREAT for typical web-surfing, email, word/spreadsheet/office work, and for doing 95% of what most computer users want in a portable.  It is compact and powerful. I've used one for several years for trips and weekends- I can keep up on email, play music, even watch a movie on it (DVD player built in)..The 1.33ghz has built-in WIFI and bluetooth, so my external keyboard works perfectly with it, and I use it in any coffee shops or WIFI zones while travelling.The weakest point (in my perspective) is that it's not a powerhouse processor. If you're thinking of making movies on it, you're going to find yourself spending a good bit of time. But for 95% of what people do on laptops, this thing ROCKS!  The battery life ranges - - I've seen 45 minutes, and with a brand new battery 3.5hrs. i'm also a super power-user, so I generally \"run the wheels off\" anything I use.. so comparatively you might see it last a wee bit better..The comparison to a netbook is very true. And this thing actually has a hard drive!  and, what's best: if you lose it or it gets stolen, you're not out $1300  --- the purchase price is very reasonable by comparison.  I know a handful of folks with these 12\" 1.33's, and they all love them.","Date":"December 4, 2010"}

{"Title":"Great computer for the money and especially for seniors","Author":"Joseph M. Seda","ReviewID":"R2YJTBEQ46WKTU","Overall":"good","Content":"Works well enough to be almost competitive for my 2 GB, dual core 3GHz, Win XP desktop. I was surprised it worked well even with only the 512 MB on board memory. With a full Gig it runs quite well, on office programs, internet browsing, and even viewing YouTube videos. The battery still works several hours on a charge, unusual for a used computer. Also it came with OS 10.5 instead of the 10.4. A Mac of his type is perfect for seniors without technical backgrounds. Easy to learn and use. A really good buy for the casual user. Only handicap is the limited 3rd party software available, however apple applications do have good reputations. Actually the only thing missing to make it a perfect computer is MS office.","Date":"November 11, 2013"}

Betamacs is an awesome company in my opinion, because they exceeded their advertised product quality.  not only was the computer new looking, but it was also preloaded with many different programs i would've downloaded later, such as open office, firefox, etc.  They also gave me a good 20 extra GB of hard drive capacity.  I will be writing my second novel on this computer, it's really all I needed and I think the processor runs better than intel.

{"Title":"Apple ibook g4 osx 10.5.8 leopard","Author":"goodfella","ReviewID":"R15LD24JLIEZ12","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I guess this product is pretty decent being that it 1st came out in 2005 or 2006. Pros: great operating system, ( osx leopard 10.5.8). No set up required or installations necessary.ok software preinstalled. used, but came in pretty good condition, with only surface scratches. came with everything the seller described plus extras (laptop carrying bag).Cons: ibook g4 gets really hot on the bottom. unable to udpate to lastest programs, such as adobe flash, google chrome etc. the ibook g4 (os x 10.5 leopard) is a power pc so most web program updates are not compatable with this system (adobe,browsers etc). the updates are for intel pc's which this is not, so thats why you cant install program updates. only browser compatable is safari 5.0, firefox 3.6, camino and a few others (old versions). On youtube the flash loads up slow and lags with this g4 ppc, but its manageable. 4 stars for good condition of ibook g4. 5 stars for the OS. 1 star for the processor speed. 4 stars for the seller of this notebook. overall 3.5 stars. PS if your a windows person this is the wrong pc for you unless you want a change from virus prone windows. completely different platform from windows which'll take some getting use to.","Date":"November 9, 2011"}

I had the ibook for about a week and attempted to download my first CD to itunes and the CD got stuck. I returned it and they quickly repaired the CD drive and it's worked fine since. About a week ago (i first received this ibook on 3/4/11), while surfing the web the computer screen will make a screeching sound and then freeze up. I also get the error message to restart the computer. I do, and it'll freeze up again...and again and again. Some times, it doesn't even make it to the desktop and it'll freeze up on me. Needless to say I'm pretty frustrated at this point. I'll be returning the ibook this week and hopefully they can fix or replace. I'll updated this review accordingly.","Date":"March 29, 2011"}
{"Title":"A Great Laptop","Author":"MikeL","ReviewID":"R13KFPM5Y7IY1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased an iBook G4 for my son as a Christmas gift.  I'd been shopping for a refurbished laptop for a while, not wanting to spend the money for a new laptop for a 16-year old at this time.  The G4 got great reviews and, since my wife owns a newer MacBook that my son borrowed constantly, I thought the iBook would ease the competition in our home for computer resources.  This particular model has lived up to its reviews extremely well--it's a functional, solidly made appliance that has all the capabilities needed, including Bluetooth connectivity and a connection to our home wireless network via AirPort.  It's certainly not as flashy as the newer, forged-from-a-single-block-of-aluminum model, but it fills the bill splendidly.  This iBook looks to be a real workhorse and the price can't be beat.  I think I'll start looking for one for myself now....","Date":"January 22, 2011"}

I use email, fantasy sports, and some word processing and spreadsheets. This would seem like it would be pretty simple for microsoft and windows machines to handle but they constantly slow down, sputter, and take longer and longer to start up and turn off.Having two friends who have used Macs for years I decided to buy a used one and see how it performs with daily usage and if it compares or if it is better. This machine, while old and likely out dated by newer models is awesome. The Iphoto App is wonderful and easy, installing Office was so simple I could not believe it and a few other pieces of software.

Its now 2011 and I am writing this review with that very laptop. I've had 2 other computers since the time I bought this laptop that no longer work. Apple products may be expensive but they last forever. I have never had problems with this computer. Its battery life is actually about 2 hours longer than my dell laptop I bought last year. Most of laptops more than 5 years old have a battery life of about 5 seconds. Thats pretty impressive. Of course this laptop has inferior specs compared to computers today, but you can still do basic things like browse the internet, write papers, synthesize music (yes it comes with garageband), photoshop, some games, etc.Its operating system is immune to all windows viruses. There is hardly any malware out there for mac os x. So you're computer won't slow down overtime from browsing the web like windows will. People say there are no programs for macs, but since the popularity of macs has risen over the years this is no longer true. I have all the basic programs I have on my windows computer like Microsoft Word, VLC, Firefox, MSN messenger, etc. Just a note, the highest operating system you can have for this computer is Mac os x leopard as it doesn't not have an intel processor.I'd recommend this computer if you want save money. Don't expect to play modern day games on it or anything, but expect to find most of your favorite windows programs written for mac. Still 7 years later this computer is still going strong.","Date":"April 27, 2011"}

The problem is that the Laptop was described as in \"Very Good Condition\" and it was far from being in good condition. The top and bottom of the laptop has cracks and deep scratches, much worse that would what would even be considered in Fair Condition. I understand white MacBooks get scratches that does not bother me. This laptop looks like someone put it in a bag of rocks and then shook it. The screen is damaged and has a \"dark spot\" on it about a inch in diameter. The laptop is also missing several screws and the case has bad yellowing on it. It gets even worse, if you go into system preferences and look at the system info the laptop serial number is different from the serial number on the bottom of the where the batter goes. Which means this laptop was has been rebuilt out of scrap parts. Do not buy from this seller, the product they sold me was not even close to what was described.","Date":"October 11, 2011"}

My friend refurbished an old Sony Vaio for me, and admittedly I'll be sad to see this one go. My issues with it throughout its lifetime:1. Mousepad messed up. It was a very minor thing (I think the clicker wasn't working well?) and Geek Squad actually completely made it un-useable. My warranty expired right after they \"fixed\" it, so I just used a mouse ever since. If I use the pad, the mouse will just jump all over the screen and click things. Again, Geek Squad's fault. They're horrible.2. It overheats... But that's because I never clean the fan. Woops.3. Battery can finally not be charged (after five years+, I'd say that's a good lifespan for a battery), but works fine plugged in!4. Got some nasty viruses and had to get the hard drive revamped about.... 2 times? But that wasn't the equipment's fault.All in all, super glad I made this purchase.

You might think that an \"entertainment PC\" would have somewhat decent media specs, but NOT THIS ONE! When jacked in to my stereo, it creates whirring and hissing noises that obscure any subtle audio details. Also, the onboard microphone is about the noisiest thing I've ever heard, including old JC Penney tape recorders and the like. I kid you not... the worst sound of any laptop anywhere. HP have outdone themselves in lowering the bar for consumer laptops. And now, not even three years old, the motherboard has given out. I'll be shopping for another brand.

{"Title":"It's almost perfect - after a few tweaks.","Author":"ScOObydoo","ReviewID":"R23TK6K6C7HSNU","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me start by saying that out of the box this product would never receive 4 stars. This is why; Vista on 1Gb of ram just won't do.Samsung have clearly listened to some complaints as my unit did not come with McAfee installed, in fact that amount of bloatware was very limited. Upon booting the device installs itself, then needs an hour to create a backup on its drive. Which is annoying because it places it on a hidden partition swallowing up 13Gb of storage (of your 60Gb).The touch settings in Vista are pretty bad by default, so you really need to tweak those a lot to get them right (turn off the silly mouse \"help\" pointer, enable the keyboard instead of handwriting recognition etc...).After that you need to do something mean to it; rip it open and swap out the 1Gb module for a 2Gb one. It's not for everyone but there are some very handy video tutorials online. All you need is a small screwdriver and steady hands. The 2Gb module (2Gb DDR2 notebook memory) cost me $49. With 2Gb you'll notice a MASSIVE increase in speed. Applications now run smoothly, open fast and there is little to no disk memory swapping. But like I said; it's not a question of an easy to open panel, you need to remove the entire backside of the machine to reach the ram. Why Samsung don't just deliver it with 2Gb is beyond me.Once you have upgraded the ram and tweaked the OS you need to turn off the Vista indexing service (google it), this reduces the amount of drive accesses for indexing your files. All that does is help with file searches which you probably rarely do anyway.Now with 2Gb, better tweaks and some services turned off you'll want to turn off the Vista Aero settings (once again; google it).It's taken you 2 hours, but now you have a PERFECT speedy little UMPC that runs nice and fast.Some general observations:The mouse pointer is beyond useless. It has little to no acceleration, use the stylus and keep the mouse in joystick mode, it'll make scrolling much easier.The \"dialpad\" popup keyboard is horrendous, ignore it and never touch it again.The keyboard on the device itself is for emergencies only. Because that is about the only time you'll put yourself through the agony of typing something on it. The best and (in my opinion) fastest way to type is with the on screen keyboard, or the (optional) Samsung portable keyboard (or any small keyboard of your choice). The Samsung is listed for $89, but comes with a built in eraserhead mouse. Amazon has a folding Bluetooth keyboard for $29 which is a great option for this machine.Audio is impressive, nice and loud.Wifi is great, it connects much faster than my Dell XPS notebook and never drops a signal.The device boots in under a minute and wakes from sleep in around 12 seconds (including connecting to wifi).The screen is perfect; great resolution and extremely bright and sharp.Heat is an issue. It DOES get warm, but never to the point where it will burn you or that it becomes too hot to handle.The Microsoft Origami interface is awesome. Anyone that has seen Media Center will recognize the look and feel. It's a media center/application launcher optimized for touch screens.Bluetooth is stable, they use the Widcomm Bluetooth stack (which put simply means they use a third party company for the Bluetooth software and not the limited Microsoft package).The package is a little limited. You get the unit, a charger, a battery, a wrist strap (that also works as a handle, very clever) and a cheap (poor quality) case. In my opinion Samsung should have delivered it with the organizer case and a keyboard, but I fully understand they wanted to keep costs low on it.All in all it's a winner. I picked it over the competition (Sony UX380 or the OQO model II) because of the screen and the fact that I can upgrade the Ram. The Sony is limited to 1Gb no matter what you do, and the OQO is underpowered with a VIA cpu. Even though this device is only 800MHz I felt that it ran faster than the OQO model II I tested.  It also has the perfect screen size to resolution ratio. The Sony has a higher resolution screen, but is 2 inches smaller making it near impossible to work on for longer durations.My only real annoyance with Samsung is the model numbering on the Q1 ultra series. First of all; calling it Q1 was plain stupid. The previous model was also called Q1, and it's nothing like this machine, so google searches for \"q1 ultra\" return 100's of hits on \"q1 ultra portable\" which is usually NOT this device. Note to Samsung; next time, call it Q2.Then the various models of the Q1 Ultra; they make one with no Bluetooth or cameras, one with Vista, 2 cameras and Bluetooth but no fingerprint scanner, one with XP, 2 cameras, Bluetooth and a fingerprint scanner and several others. All with cryptic names. Bad move. It's near impossible to determine what the exact specifications are of this machine.All in all I can highly recommend the Samsung Q1 Ultra for people shopping for an ultra portable PC. If you use Skype, Office, Internet Explorer/Firefox, Mail and most other basic applications you will be very happy (once again; only on 2Gb). It won't do well on heavy applications like video editing or graphic designs.","Date":"December 26, 2007"}

I love this as well as I can read my personal outlook emails on the device and my personal gmails at once without them being deleted so my regular laptop still has a full email record.I am starting to use the MSFT Origami interface that comes with it, and so far I like the interface for playing music.The device only has 1 gig of ram, but I have open and am using onenote, windows live mail, lotus notes, a few browser windows, word  and am playing music on it with only the most occasional music stutter.... with the Vista OS.It launches applications slowly once you have consumed the ram and the hard drive isn't all that fast ... but once launched it swaps between applications fine.(+- 11 sec to load excel as opposed to +- 4 sec on my fast LT)Remember I only bought this to take electronic notes on .....  but I may even leave my laptop at home next trip.I am buying the larger 6 cell battery (I think it should have come with this already for the price) but I got over +- 3.5 hours with wireless on and connected with the std battery.  I hope I will be able to have Samsung upgrade this later and add a  cellular chip in this model  but I doubt they will do that....  If you need cellular, I'd say wait.So what don't I like,Some usability nits with the key positioning, a tad more spacing would be better, rubberized keys perhaps and the most popular extra keys positioned on the outside (like the esc key).Of course I'd love a faster CPU, more ram and a faster hard drive, but I'll always say this ......This device is usable as it is, when a faster one comes out I may chuck my laptop away for good.","Date":"July 26, 2007"}

I have had this thing for about a month now and am still drooling over it. Everywhere I whip this badboy out people are fascinated with it. I usually hear a comment about the screen first. People usually say,\" Is that high def or something?\" Anayways the screen is definitely bright and crisp. This computer is a total desktop/laptop replacement unless your into advanced gaming. Oh well that's what the xbox360,PS3, and Wii are for. Yeah you might have to wait a couple seconds longer to load an application and the keys are a little close together, but who really cares? I use the stylus for just about everything and this computer can do everything yours does or more! The 7 inch bright 1024 by 600 native resolution is absolutely perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy a computer regardless of desktop,laptop etc. especially college students or anybody that likes to take notes, doodle, and journal. Seriously though, its a little trade off to wait a couple of seconds more to have the sleek, James Blondish super cool head turning mobile PC that this sexy monster is. ENJOY!  This review was written on this computer using mainly the stylus. :)","Date":"July 31, 2007"}
{"Title":"Fabulous Machine!","Author":"Ronald M. Cordes \"Watch Looker\"","ReviewID":"R3CWKQI7PD0T7D","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Q1 Ultra NP-Q1UA000 with Windows XP installed.  (I read so many other reviews suggesting that Vista was too taxing on the processor and 1 GB of memory).  The bottom line is:  This is everything I expected it to be and more!  I did order the portfolio/keyboard combo but it is still on backorder.  Nevertheless, the variety of input methods (stylus, on-screen keyboard, dial keys and split Qwerty buttons) work extremely well for me.  I bought this machine for two purposes: to check email on the road and to provide a compact way of taking notes during the many work meetings I attend. Its internet capability using Wi-Fi is as smooth as silk and the note taking via Windows Journal and One Note is really neat after you get the hang of it.  The screen resolution is really nice and its readability is enhanced by the brightness settings using the sensitive touch buttons at the top.  Samsung thought of most every niche including a slot for MMC and SD cards--a feature that allows me to share camera shots without hogging hard disk space.  With Windows XP, in lieu of Vista, only 16 of the 60 GB hard drive is used...and that includes the full suite of Microsoft Office 2003 and several other larger programs.  I've read a number of critical reviews about this UMPC but for me, this little jewel is A-1.  Negative things?  OK, the split Qwerty buttons are small, but the on-screen keyboad (and the USB keyboard on order) suppresses that frustration.  The other dislike is that the extended life battery is thicker so that the machine slants to one side when set on a flat surface and I doubt if it will fit too well in the portfolio I have on backorder.  I did order the external USB ODD with the machine and I would highly recommend this to anyone who buys one.  On the other hand, almost any external USB driven DVD/RW will work.  Overall, I am very very happy with this computer.","Date":"September 4, 2007"}

Both with the original 60GB disk (I used a 4GB \"EP\" SD chip for ReadyBoost) and with a SanDisk SSD I fitted (look up Hugo Ortega for how) it works at nice speed.  The screen is clear and bright, you need good eyesight of course.The flaws:- WiFi range mediocre.  At home it failed to work in a room where several other devices worked fine.  Set up the WiFi in a place where signal is known strong otherwise you will go nuts trying to juggle the mystery messages in the setup screens.- the mouse thingy at the left is virtually unusable.  Last resort.  It is a joystick but it either zooms or crawls, does not seem to have much dynamic range.  Fortunately you can use the cursor or a fingernail.- the screen does NOT allow you to rest your hand on it, the sensor will not be able to figure out the stylus.  This makes handwriting a bit awkward since you need to rest your hand somewhere and almost everything has some kind of button or sensor on it.  Portrait-right mode is the best for right-handed since the lower edge is clear of gadgets.- the split keyboard is not very good.  Not because it is split, but because the buttons are just too easily mistaken and also the choice of what is on the buttons is awkward.  It works, but not any faster than stylus onscreen.  For logins if you have a \"strong\" password you will go nuts trying to get your password right.- THE THUMB READER IS MISSING.  Despite it being in all the images on Amazon, the model they ship does not have the reader.  And I still have not been able to figure out if Samsung will agree to sell it separately.- the velour sleeve supplied has effectively no protection.  You will want something to carry this safely.Battery life seems good, there seems to be minimal crapware installed, in many ways this is a good experience.  But there could be definite improvements.  Handwriting recognition is fast and accurate.  It is a bit large to be a pocket machine but is quite unobtrusive in a bag.  It is big enough to show email, documents, and web quite clearly.","Date":"February 21, 2008"}

You will need to upgrade the memory to 2gb and replace the atheros wifi module. The cheap wifi module causes the system to constantly pause (for up to 10 seconds!). It's a driver issue for sure but none the less, it's annoying. After these changes I still wasn't happy with the performance so I switched to xp tablet PC edition OS. Now my Q1u-v runs ok. I've come to not expect much in the performance department of these little PC but they should be able to at least play video files without annoying pauses.

{"Title":"Q1 Ultra - an innovative UMPC","Author":"Joseph Kim \"DrJosephKim\"","ReviewID":"R3019Q5UMM5UK0","Overall":"good","Content":"I've tested various UMPCs, and this one is very innovative and fits my needs quite well. The keyboard is small like many say, but you can get used to it (as long as you don't have really large hands). The screen is touch only (no active digitizer), so you'll run into significant vectoring issues. The processor is slow, but in return you get excellent battery life. So, as long as you're not looking for the performance of a dual-core processor, you'll be able to run your basic office applications and stay productive with extended use times. Finally, the best part of this unit is that it stays relatively cool in your hands compared to many other UMPCs I've tested.

Because I wanted a good compromise between screen quality and portability in a windows device. What for? believe it or not: to be able to run a 3D CAD program (namely DesignCAD). Not realy in order to do the main drawings there, but in order to have them available, be able to look at them when on the go and eventually even create a small item in order to evaluate it. I really was not sure if this would work when i got it...but at $750 for the qiuv i took the risk. I did an upgrade to 2GB and i must say: I AM AMAZED. not only does the design program work perfectly fine (of course not as smooth as on my desktop, but it really does work, including rendering shaded objects and moving them around). Now, with this design program (and many other programs too) it is helpful to have keys available in order to enter commands. the keys around the screen are doing a great job here. And the fact that you have a tablet pc in a slate shape and still access to hardware keys is really extremely convenient and you find yourself sitting in a coffee shop surfing the web with a little something in your hand. This device really has been designed with the end user in mind. It definitely changes the way one uses a pc when on the go. I do agree that for longer texts i would use an external keyboard, but being used to the thumb keyboards from my pocket pcs i learned typing blindly on the keyboard rather fast and i use it for chatting and emailing on a daily basis. the qiuv has become my daily companion and i simply love it.","Date":"June 11, 2008"}

{"Title":"Everything I needed in a portable package","Author":"Fritz","ReviewID":"R3C1PJTGGAUL18","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been very happy with HP computers, the DV9420us is my second HP laptop and the 4yr old one is still going strong.  In addition I've been pleasantly surprised by how good their customer service is even though I hate the loss of US jobs.  The 9420 has a huge bright screen for those of us that need 3-4 windows going at the same time.  The keyboard is a nice size so I don't have to scrunch my hands together when typing long projects, and I like the number pad off to the side for quick spreadsheet work.  The keys also seem to be built a little sturdier than some other brands.  2GB of RAM is just fine for most things and seems to run the VISTA Memory Monster just fine.  Word to the wise, don't get less than 2GB of RAM if you're running Vista.  I wouldn't consider this a hardcore gaming computer at all (nor any laptop for that matter) but I can play some good games just the same.  Hard drive size is good at 240GB, multi-card reader is a great feature, and the AMD TL-64 chip seems to be pretty speedy but all that power runs awfully hot so you won't want to work with the computer on your lap for too long unless you're out of hot chocolate on a frosty winter day.  The outside of the computer looks very nice with the slick black finish but it is a fingerprint/smudge magnet.  Thank God good Ole HP threw in a small \"computer napkin\" AT NO EXTRA CHARGE just for that reason.  Those people think of everything!  The only con is the mouse pad.  The old style had a texture to it so your finger would slide smoothly, the 9420's pad is now smooth and gets a little sticky at times.  I'm also not a fan of the new mouse pad page scroller.  For some reason it doesn't seem to interact with webpages quite as well as their old one.  It appears to be a software issue or I just haven't figured it out yet.  All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, I feel I got a lot of computer at a relatively affordable price and that's saying something because I'm cheap.  I sure wish they would've given me more than just a trial version of Office2007, but that's ok, I'll just use the free OpenOffice software instead \"HAHA! Take that Microsoft!\".  For the record, my primary uses are school, business, and home entertainment.  Happy Shopping","Date":"August 1, 2007"}

When it arrived my husband and I were so impressed, we bought another for him. I will warn you right now if you order more than one of these laptops, you can only get a rebate for one through amazon.com. They do not allow more than one rebate for this per household. I did not get that information until after I purchased both.As for the laptop, I found the layout of the keys to be comfortable and I like that I am able to turn on and off the wireless at the touch of a button. Playing movies on this laptop looks great as well. The picture comes out clear and easy to see (not grainy and fuzzy).I do have to add, I'm not thrilled that it came with Windows Vista. I have tried Vista in the past and I'm not a fan. Unfortunately even if you order this laptop straight from HP you still don't have the option of a different operating system, so you might as well save some money and order from Amazon.One last thing to add, when I received my laptop, my power cord was bad. It charged my laptop for twenty minutes and then stopped. I called HP the next day and they over-nighted a new power supply to me at no extra charge. Their service staff was friendly and easy to work with.I would recommend HP and this laptop in the future.","Date":"September 16, 2007"}
{"Title":"A Fantastic Price but a bit bulky","Author":"J. Fujino \"bookworm\"","ReviewID":"RK7EW8PLXLSJ7","Overall":"good","Content":"Warning: Not for wimps.This computer is a scaled-down desktop replacement, but its still a desktop replacement so if you're thinking you can lug this around on a daily basis then think again.  Your back or your shoulder will probably only be able to handle occasion transport (the computer itself is 7.8lbs and if you factor in  the AC adapter it will go up to about 11 lbs.  Then add accessories like a mouse, put that on a scale and decide if a 15.4\" is really that small a price to pay for portability).Fortunately, it does have beautiful screen and if you're watching DVDs or playing games it will be impressive.  The nVidia 6150 card will do well for a modest gamer but it will not be able to handle upcoming games especially since they are moving on to directx10 graphics and modern games will probably have to run on lower settings.The processor is good, not the best Turion and slower than most Core 2 Duos but it will get the job done and unless you're going to do movie and photo editing or serious gaming you won't have any problems.The biggest weakness of this PC, though, has to be its memory.  1 Gig of Ram is ridiculous to try to run any version of Vista on.  If you're going to purchase this also purchase a gig of RAM and install that as well because Vista really requires at least a gig to run at an acceptable speed.If you aren't an expert than you probably are reluctant to open the bottom of a $1000 piece of equipment and start messing with things.  Another option is to but it direct from HP. You can customize a dv9500 on their site and it will probably cost about the same.  The only problem is they won't offer options like the AMD Turion or 6150.  You'll have to order something more or less powerful.Altogether its an affordable large screen PC with great power for a $1000 but poor mobility.","Date":"July 18, 2007"}

Expect about 2 hours on normal usage.Since then I have increased the operating speed by adding another Gig of memory (about $80.00) and replacing the hard drive with a larger faster 180 gig Sata 7200 rpm drive (about $120.00) and using the original drive in the second drive bay for video's and data. You will need a HP Sata drive caddy to install it (about $35.00). The mouse pad can be sticky due to perspiration.The original bad news....Initially had intermittent web-cam and external USB devices along with loss of audio and changing of display settings and freezing of video playback and system lockup. Returning from hibernation or sleep mode would crash the system or programs would crash it. Just about every problem others had stated.HP support solution was to do a system reload which worked until you added a USB device or 3rd party software.I worked around the problems by reinstalling drivers and not shutting the computer down defeating the purpose of a laptop.","Date":"May 29, 2008"}

{"Title":"Nice keyboard, bright screen, memory hog, annoying screen freezes","Author":"sk-cjg - NH","ReviewID":"RCLST3M24DURX","Overall":"bad","Content":"I love the keyboard size and the fact that it has a numeric keyboard already built in.  The mouse is a bit \"sticky\" so I use a USB mouse. The screen is bright and clear, very easy to read and not hard on the eyes after long sessions. It is too heavy to tote around everywhere but that is not what I do with mine. I don't like the fingerprint magnet black finish although it does look nice when it's polished up. The only real problem I have with it is its constant freezes.  I increased the memory from 1gig to 2gigs and it has helped it to run faster but has not done anything for the freeze issues.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, but with reservations about the cause of the freezing (not yet established) and would recommend buying extra memory before even opening the box. We have two of these machines in our family. Both perform similarly and both have those random freezes that just appear out of nowhere. UPDATE*** freezes appear to be related to video card driver requiring updates & compatibility issues with Vista.  Problem reduced to occasional freezes compared to 2 or 3 per day before finding updated drivers. EDIT 2012... THE VIDEO CARD INSIDE OF IT MELTED DOWN IN 2011, TURNING IT INTO AN EXPENSIVE PAPERWEIGHT!

Besides XP will not be supported for us by MS any more\". So in short the old \"good\" MS + \"designed for MS Windows\" is playing a role here.At the end of the day I cursed a few times and installed Fedora Linux 8, which is the only one working with the HP new BIOS protection, which prevents you from putting a different OS on their machine and is desperately crying for a class action lawsuit against monopolizing the market of hardware, benefiting the OS vendor.","Date":"April 6, 2008"}

{"Title":"Good out of the box, great with a couple of inexpensive upgrades.","Author":"Gonzo","ReviewID":"R346U4BDNTUWD0","Overall":"good","Content":"It is a great laptop if you can get it for under $200.  I actually \"downgraded\" to XP when I first got it, which ran better then VISTA.  A really good thing about this laptop is that you can extend it life and usefulness with a few upgrades.  The easiest is swapping out the memory.  It comes with 1 gig but you can add 4 gigs (2 sticks of 2 gigs)of PC2 5300 memory for about $45.  You can also replace the Hard Drive with a SSD.  But what I recommend is a Hybrid HD/SSD.  I added a 500 gig drive for about $80.  Not only is it a lot cheaper this way,but because the laptop has an older SATA the performance is almost going to be the same as a full solid state because of the bottle neck.The laptop comes with a Intel Core-Duo T2450 which was a decent processor at the time but you can actually \"upgrade\" the chip to a Core 2 Duo T5200 (Socket M) without a bios update and a used chip will only run about $10.  The best part about replacing the chip is that with a Core 2, you can run a 64 bit OS.  So I am currently rocking 64 bit Windows 7 on my MT6840 and it is running great.  Another benefit I found is that the new processor and HD runs a LOT cooler then what came stock.So I would defiantly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a decent affordable laptop with a solid upgrade path that can be done in parts.","Date":"September 25, 2013"}

So began a 5-year love affair that I would never forget. It was comfortable. It was feature rich. Things just \"felt right\" with it, like a broken-in pair of trusty work boots. Sometimes it ran hot overnight, but you were still there.Was it perfect? No. There were a few issues with drivers here & there, but it was in my living room for casual web surfing & mild gaming for years. I got quickly used to the touchpad & classic 2-button layout. Didn't like those? There's 3 above & the classic IBM 'nibber'. The screen was of the no-longer-used 4:3 aspect ratio, giving me outstanding resolution.My question is this: Why did we abandon the 4:3 laptop? I don't need a widescreen display for spreadsheets, websurfing, or dev work. I'm doing that instead of watching The Hunger Games. Most laptops have just 1366x768, and this dinosaur blows them away for pixels(but at a price).I wish the 4:3 laptop would comeback. You would have business users buy them in a heartbeat with a modern version of this. It's just in the screen.Goodnight, Thinkpad. We had a wonderful journey together.","Date":"June 3, 2013"}

The machine worked well and the software was pretty good; although, some of the preloaded software wasn't that helpful and just used up some of the hard drive space.The screen isn't very good and powerful graphics chip goes to waste with a not so clear screen. The computer is fast, when it works.It only took four months before my hard drive crashed. Lenovo service did a great job of sending out the new hard drive and recovery disks but they couldn't help me restore my machine from my external Western Digital drive. Windows Vista kept on asking for an installation disk and as Windows Vista was pre-installed I didn't have this disk. Eventually, I gave up and paid a local tech to restore my computer for $300.The replacement hard drive lasted about 1 year and then it crashed as well. When I originally purchased the machine, I bought the expensive 5 year on-sight service as well. The extra cost didn't bother me, I have money and NO time to deal with computer crashes.Lenovo apparently reset my warranty period when they sent me the new hard drive, to an absurdly short period of time. As such, my machine was already past its warranty period. I purchased the recovery disks for $60 and bought a Western Digital hard drive from Tiger Direct. There is no way I am paying Lenovo for another substandard hard drive.Any benefits this machine may have, is outweighed by the fact that if the hard drive is dead - you have an expensive door stop and nothing more.This will be my first and last Lenovo laptop.","Date":"December 12, 2010"}

{"Title":"Love my Lenovo","Author":"Daniel Haworth \"Flechmen Foxwood\"","ReviewID":"R2FR1IU5OM0SCS","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me tell you a story. A great many years ago, I had an IBM T30. That thing was a tank. It got dropped, battered, and abused. At one point it even flew out of a bicycle toddler trailer and into the middle of a road with very minimal damage. After the life that thing lived in my care, I sold it to a friend, who abused it for 5 more years before the motherboard gave up.After that machine, I was sold on Thinkpads, and I saved up to custom build a T61. I ordered mine direct from Lenovo and had it customized... 4GBs of RAM, nVidia graphics, Windows XP.. Later on, I put a 500GB hard drive in it and Windows 7.Lenovo carried on IBM's legacy with the Thinkpads. The quality on this unit is fantastic.The casing is solid and reliable, all of the components are incredibly reliable. I've never had an issue with my T61.This thing has been taken all over, dropped, stepped on, and battered. And it's taken all of this abuse with just one little piece of plastic breaking off. The lid hinges are solid stainless steel, the top is solid magnesium, the bottom is thick rugged plastic. This is one well built laptop.The nVidia NVS Quadro graphics used to be able to play most games with ease. The most modern of games tax it pretty heavily though. Considering it's a business laptop and not really a gaming one, this is pretty good.All features work well on it, including the kinda gimmicy keyboard light, which actually is quite helpful in the dark. Parts are readilly availble for it as well, so it's an easy machine to fix.Lenovo's support is second to none. After reinstalling Windows on this machine, the only thing you need to download is the Lenovo update utility and it will take care of the rest. Never seen another manufacture do that!The only things I've really had issue with is the power supply, which failed on me after a couple of years, and the sound card, which, like most modern systems, is this little Realtek thing that sounds terrible.But, those are my only real complaints. This poor laptop has been through a lot, and it's been a tough little beast.I would recommend this product.","Date":"February 23, 2013"}
{"Title":"6 y/o ThinkPad T61 still gives other laptops a whipping","Author":"LarryLMedina","ReviewID":"R1CPC9Y0AU3TP6","Overall":"good","Content":"I did not buy this laptop through Amazon but I wanted to share my thoughts here. I'm a poor counselor, living from paycheck to paycheck in highest-in-the-nation-cost-of-living state of Hawaii, and in college working toward my MSW. I needed a robust laptop to put up with college/work/personal life so I bought this T61 from a refurbisher for $130. It came with Win7, 80GB HDD, 2GB RAM and integrated graphics. Key tops were half-worn on the Home row and the LCD is wobbly from worn hinges. When closed, there is still a bit of play with the lid not latching down tightly. 6 years of existence and the laptop does creak a little on sides. I'm not complaining as this is a used T61 and I didn't expect roses.I upgraded the HDD and RAM and installed Windows 8. The T61 boots/runs faster with all the upgrades. The non-glare LCD is easy on the eyes, although dimmer than other non-glare LCD's I've seen (this is likely not due to age, since I read similar comments written back in 2007 when the T61 was first released). The touchpad is the smallest I've ever come across on any laptop and took me a while to get accustomed to. The T61's Trackpoint is a relic from the 1990s and I feel is outdated as a mouse control device and useless like a human appendix or a vestigal tail is. Lenovo still insisted to include it (and still does to this day) apparently to keep Trackpoint fans happy. The keyboard is louder/noiser and less firm than other keyboards I've used on other business/professional-grade laptops; however perfectly usable and comfortable to type on happily for hours without fatigue. Speakers aren't loud; a bit tinny to my ears but clear. The LCD lid's rubber coating mars easily but is easily cleaned up with a wiping of Windex. Contrary to another review written here, the lid itself is not solid magnesium: instead, it is a composite plastic (not carbon fiber) over a magnesium frame. Its construction still does the job in keeping it solid and near-flexible. The T61 is of the \"thin-and-light\" category when \"thin-and-light\" was defined at around 4-5lbs (the weight of this T61 is 5.2lbs with the stock batt). I got a new 7800mah batt off Amazon.com ($25) which bumps the weight up past 6lbs. Thin, yes. Light? No.Incidentally, batt life is 9+ hours with this new 7800mah batt under Win8 and in Power Saver mode, wifi off, and LCD dimmed to 50%.My T61 is good, solid-feeling (and solid-looking) laptop. Everything just works. The T61's early-1990's conservative looks, severely angular lines and all-black color make it look either 20+ years old or modern and contemporary, depending on who's eyeing it (I just think it looks \"classic\"). Other resellers sell T61's with better specs for up to $400 (and likely in better condition than mine) but I'm happy with the one I got and the price I paid for it. //","Date":"August 20, 2013"}

Rugged, affordable, reliable, these older laptops have delivered good performance and are always a solid financial choice, hundreds of dollars below similar, newer products. I purchased mine through Amazon marketplace with XP installed. I like XP and I don't need anything else for now. I installed 2 memory sticks of 2GB RAM each. The laptop, predictably, went to 3.2GB Ram, not 4. That is the maximum you'll get. I also had the HD replaced at Microcenter, but made the mistake of believing the salesman and instead of a full SSD, I let them put a hybrid HD. My laptop is faster than it would have been with its regular HD, but not even close to as fast as it would have been with a Solid State Drive. Besides, Microcenter charged me a pretty penny for the hybrid HD and for the installation. Corollary: install an SSD, period.Still, the laptop is great. I bought it used from Tampa Laptops (great seller, by the way). I tweaked what I judged was necessary and I've had a smooth-running laptop ever since.

The only complaint i have about it is the hard drive space - it only holds 80GB.other than, if they made laptops like Lenovo's all the time, i'd sell my soul for one.","Date":"March 17, 2012"}
{"Title":"Too hot to handle","Author":"Daniel","ReviewID":"RHIMI38YZVOK3","Overall":"bad","Content":"The T61 is too hot to handle.  Since it was new, the laptop is too hot to put on your lap and becomes very uncomfortable to even lay your palms on it while typing.  It inadvertently goes into sleep mode at the most inoportune times due to overheating.  I read some of the posts on the web and they suggest cleaning the air intake.  However, I doubt it was clogged when I bought it new and it ran very hot then.  It is so hot, you cannot consider this a laptop as you couldn't possible keep it on your lap.  Makes it very difficult to use.","Date":"July 18, 2011"}

{"Title":"Perfect little dev box for a great price","Author":"Steven","ReviewID":"R2KWRBJ3D6SG39","Overall":"good","Content":"I was very surprised to see current reviews on this machine! This thing was born over a half a decade ago!Well, I bought mine because I wanted a separate dev box outside of my 2011 Macbook Pro. I love my MBP, but I already have it setup with Bootcamp (Windows 7), I didn't want to load another OS on it (space is starting to get tight), plus I wanted something that would function as a sort of mini-server for my own personal projects. Finally, I wanted something I could lug around without worrying about breaking it, so I bought this thing.I really couldn't be happier! I decided to replace the existing HDD with a 50 gig SSD that I found at Micro Center (Denver)  for $39 on clearance. I also replaced the battery with an Anker battery which I bought here on Amazon for $40. I loaded her up with Ubuntu and this thing zips right along! ~$180 might seem a little pricey for a 6 year old laptop, but considering this total includes SSD and a brand new battery, I'm quite pleased. SSD is more energy efficient and Ubuntu is fairly lightweight (compared to Windows), so I get a little over 4 hours of battery life which is certainly acceptable for this machine.The display is surprisingly nice and has very little glare, so it's easier on my eyes when compared to the MBP. The trackpad is nice, but not as nice as the MBP trackpad (but what is?). I like all the clicking options - I can touch the trackpad or use the buttons above or below the trackpad. The red tracking button on the keyboard is great and was quite easy to get used to.This thing is a joy to hack around on! SSD is a must, so I recommend throwing a small SSD in it if you can. The 50 gig drive I have now is small, but it's perfect for my needs as I really only use this as a dev box (I use my MBP for things like games, media, etc). Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, the hinges do suck a bit.It's heavy and ugly, but that's how I like it.","Date":"December 18, 2013"}

{"Title":"Serious laptop","Author":"Randy","ReviewID":"R2FH8OSDUGLXXB","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall: Best laptop choice for work on the go and for those on a budget.Pros: VERY comfortable keyboard, low price online, GREAT performance for work use.Cons: Screen is not very bright, bigger battery adds bulkPerformance: (typical day to day use)Scores a 3.1 on Windows ratings due to low graphics scores. Shouldn't be a factor if all you're using it for is MS office/web-browsing/emails. Other then graphics use, surfing web, multitasking MS office apps, and general day to day online activities are as buttery as any other modern day laptop.Battery: (using extended battery 6600mah)Typical 3 hours of real life use (outlook open in background, Pidgin chat, and music playing in BG) at 60% screen brightness, can be stretched to 4.5 if I was just web-browsing (no others windows/apps). I had the regular 4400mah battery at first, but it barely ran for 1.5 hours, 2 if I was stingy with it. The bigger 6600mah battery adds bulk, but travelers will appreciate the extra work-time.Design: (will grow on you as time goes on)At first glance I thought, real ugly piece of machinery. Then my work place forced me to use one and boy, it has really grown on me. The keyboard is probably the best I've ever used, EVER. That's coming from owning a couple of Toshibas, Gateways, Sonys, Apples (powerbook & new MBPs), Asus, and HP laptops before. The keyboard alone makes me want to keep this thing forever. Kudos to Lenovo for developing such a great input product. On the downside, the screen isn't very bright, so if you want to work outside one day or are near some one with a newer model laptop (which means newer kind of display technology), the screen will appear very dark.Recommended for: Those on a budget, traveling business typesSeriously, the price you pay (amazon for around $200-300 last time I checked) can't be beat. Those who are on a budget that just want a laptop for browsing the web, chatting online, and streaming movies- this one is a winners' choice. My reason for buying one was my previous job took the Lenovo T61 back, and stuck me with an \"upgraded\" Dell (arg), I've missed it ever since. Get it, you wont regret it.","Date":"April 11, 2012"}

It performs very well and my daughter (10 yrs) is very happy with it.

{"Title":"Went back to my T42","Author":"High Plain Drifter \"rave_reviewer\"","ReviewID":"R2SZK1XAOWXLKZ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I apologize to those reviewers who clearly fell in love with this machine but the reliability factor just was not there. If you poke about Amazon you will find I wrote a review of the T42 which was fairly popular, I suggested it was (AND MAYBE STILL IS) the best deal on the used computer market (for everything but HD graphics) and suggested how to update the unit for modern use. I have currently 4 T42s in a network, and they are more fun than a barrel of hammers. However, realizing that time was moving inexorably on, I could not resist picking up a T61 at what appeared to be a bargain price. The specs are to die for, right? The unit had merely \"normal\" use for its age (not a spring chicken) and the hard drive was checked with a sector by sector utility, so I figured I was in good shape. Wrong. First disappointment was the screen. What were they thinking? Sounds good on paper, especially next to the T42 but in real life the T42 display was a superb example of old tech whereas the T61 is a poor example of new tech. Strike one. The hinges truly suck as the other reviewers say. They suck on an order of magnitude that is staggering and this in spite of the fact they are oversized. Raises serious issue about Lenovo's competency. Strike two. The fan needed to be replaced (did it ever) but to some extent this was my error, I forgot, when testing, to warm the machine up first. Replaced it myself, medium complexity, especially the routing of the wires. Additional research shows the fans do not last as long as earlier models. So we are already at 3 strikes. The internal mic did not work unless (trial and error) I inserted a male plug into the mic jack (any plug, did not matter) and removed it. Annoying. Spent hours trying to solve this frustrating issue AND THEN IN LATE 2012 A FULL 6 YEARS AFTER THE MODEL WAS INTRODUCED THEY RELEASED A FIX. The new driver solved the issue but 6 years? What are they smoking at Lenovo? As this is written, the T61 is still having battery issues (system reports all systems OK but the battery dies in 18 minutes) but is otherwise OK. I am writing this review on one of my T42s. Thats really all you need to know.","Date":"September 15, 2013"}

{"Title":"Some people overlook deep flaws","Author":"N. Verma","ReviewID":"R26O6KSRH9J8IF","Overall":"bad","Content":"Thinkpad has had a venerable history since the mid-90s. For a long time there was no equal. It wasn't around the time of the 60-series versions that I began to realize how this was no longer true.Pro- Brand name, serious-business looksEquals- Has a great feeling keyboard- although by this time it has been matched and even exceeded by other business-notebook brands (i.e. hp 6910p)Cons- still overpriced relative to competitorsDeep Flaws-1. CRAP HINGES: See those little gray squares on the bottom of the screen? They're supposed to be hinges but after opening and closing the lid hundreds of times two things can happen: (1) they slowly weaken until breaking when you increase the angle of the opening too wide [in my z61m] OR (2) they stiffen to the chassis and get semi-stuck. If you absentmindedly push it open- again a break and a screen that doesn't stand up by itself [in this model, my t61]2. OVERHEATING: in this model, my t61, a overheating problem became prevalent- the computer logs off and goes on standby at irregular times because its gotten too hot! This is common according to a google search that reveals people desperately posting on forums for a solution. TPFanControl, a free software made by a third-party amateur helps the problem inadvertently by making the fan run more liberally. But its a haphazard solution where a problem shouldn't exist in the first place.Conclusion:I'm amazed people still buy into the thinkpad brand thinking its something special. Relative to competitors they were at the top of the game in the late 90s and early 2000s, but nowadays they are not some super high-quality brand leader. When will people realize this? Or maybe they just like that high-class no-frills big-business look.","Date":"May 15, 2011"}

There's a complex fix, which is way beyond my skill level, involving a soldering iron and a paper clip. I just decided to live with the locked bios, meaning I can't get into the CMOS settings to change anything, which shouldn't be a massively big deal for most users.Edited, to note, FWIW, I performed a completely unremarkable memory upgrade to 2GB, but the introduction of a used 160 GB hard drive into the belly of the beast killed the lazy old b**ch. Even though the hard drive specs indicated it was a perfect match, something went wrong, and the patient died belly open on the operating table. I removed the new hard drive and reinserted the original one, and all of a sudden, there were bizarre error messages about a network card failure.Pfft. Cracking open the slots on the bottom of the case revealed a solder knocked loose, from what looks like the network card, which was most likely caused by the age of the laptop. A real FUBAR. I could buy a soldering iron and teach myself how to repair the damaged connection, but at the rate I'm going, I might end up burning the house down.

{"Title":"Avoid this Toshiba A135-S4527","Author":"Ed Wordsmith \"Ned\"","ReviewID":"R31CK4Y7W0V5MK","Overall":"bad","Content":"Go to your favorite search engine and plug in this model and a choice keyword or two (Trouble\" or \"Problem\" ought to do for starters).  I didn't want to believe that a Toshiba Notebook could be so bad, but it seems that the joyous reverie of other reviewers (I wish them well) is not universally echoed by owners everywhere. People are having awful problems with it shutting off spontaneously and then perversely not being able to shut it once it is running.  The Hitachi SATA hard drive dies on some owners. USB isn't working right for others.  Toshiba is uncooperative, the drivers for XP are darned hard to find, Vista crashes, on and on and on.  I can't vouch for all of these problems, maybe they're operator error or sunspots or alien abductions.  All I know is that mine is going back in the packaging and off to a service depot for a long rest, hopefully for the cure of two show-stopping problems (aforementioned dead disk after 4 months, and chronic shut down problems going back to since new).Bon Voyage. l'il notebook. we hardly knew ye.Caveat emptor.","Date":"January 16, 2008"}
{"Title":"Not Bad. Not bad At All!","Author":"Orion E. Hubbard","ReviewID":"R1Z5ANNGUBHHYY","Overall":"good","Content":"The Dell Latitude D600 is really a nice little laptop. It has numerous great features like built-in wifi capabilities, 512MB of memory, a highspeed processor that makes this laptop just speed along. I think its only flaws-- and minor ones too-- is the limiting 30 GB hard drive that can get filled up far too quickly and it's small screen. While 15.6 is a standard size, it can be hard to read sometimes nontheless.Yet this laptop is a great bargain for the price as is. Still, once I got it I decided to upgrade the hard drive and get a mouse to replace the sometimes troublesome pointing stick. If you need a good laptop but don't have a major budget, this is the one to get.Ron","Date":"May 25, 2010"}

{"Title":"VERY used item asked for evaluation?","Author":"Gwen S. Walcott","ReviewID":"R1YX0MZZP0HP91","Overall":"good","Content":"This was purchased as a sacrificial test bed for software testing.  It was presented as a VERY used item that was far from 100%, so I didn't expect a \"factory new\" product.  Yes, it looks like the heck was beat out of it before it was resold, but (for the most part), it DOES work!  Unit was also shipped with Microsoft Office and AntiVirus software (long out of date, but it did update itself on 2nd use --- 2nd use because of hardware component failure.)  Item was shipped with caveat that battery was \"feet up\", but the battery holds a charge, just that it SOMETIMES doesn't transfer energy to the motherboard (but sometimes, it does).  Ditto the internal NIC card.  It was NOT listed as defective, and (as a matter of fact) presented as fully functional.  Well, it worked the first time, and failed thereafter.  I had to purchase and use a USB adapter to access the Internet (after which, the computer sizzled and popped and the NIC card came back on line and remained for a few days before quiting again.  (I found that smacking the laptop a few times would bring the NIC back on line, because when it sizzled and popped, the computer kept re-rebooting during startup. Smacking it, stopped the sizzle/pop and often brought back the NIC (task bar showing operation of the USB adapter [running at 72Mbps] the internal adapter [when it ran, it was only 11Mbps, so commanded to be off when it did run], and the ethernet connector [which also failed when the internal adapter failed --- thus the NIC card seems to be de-laminating from the motherboard).ALSO problem was unit was presented as having a CD/DVD drive.  Uh, not quite --- unit only read CDs (and Device Manager concurred --- is NOT a component failure, but is the type of installed component), so I had to purchase a USB DVD drive to install software too big for flash drives.  Also not mentioned, is power switch is finicky.  Sometimes it works, sometimes, not so much.  Actually, when if fails, it will function if I unplug the AC power cord until it turns on and begins reboot.  Then, not trusting battery, I will re-plug the unit into AC power.OVERALL --- would I recommend as a valid laptop, or a backup unit, or a starter unit?  Heck NO Would I recommend it for the purpose for which I bought it?  Heck YES!!!  Darned good super-El-Cheapo unit for sacrificial testing --- and so far it has done what it was purchased for.  If it continues working for another 6 months like this, I could say that \"I'm In Like Flint!\" for this unit.  Would I do something like this again.  YES!!!! ((I'd use better French to emphasize my pleasure, but want to keep this as a \"family\" review)).  Thank you, Amazon, for providing this type of product!!!","Date":"April 17, 2013"}

Other then it being little this thing is powerful. I was searching for something affordable for about 2 years in a row and never found nothing that was worth trying but when I ran across this Dell Latitude for only 120 bucks I couldn't resist.I was so nervous the day I received this big ol box by Ups . My husband just looked in shock because I always chance things and they always end up bad lol , but when I did open it and saw how clean it was with not one mark on it we both started getting excited. I then turned to him and kindly said \"we'll now that you seen mines , you better order yourself one because this one is only for my use\"! (I know mean right , but you have to understand why I said it)So going on , I  had to order 2 more the same day.I must say my whole family loves this computer. Especially my son, At night I hear him in his bed room playing music and I have to go in and tell him to turn it down(another plus it can get very loud). One night I even had to take it away from him because I knew If I didn't he would've failed his test the next day. Honestly guys/girls this is really a good purchase. If I had to say anything on a neggitive side this would be my only complaint, NO WEB CAM! That's pretty messed up but I can always go and buy one for 50 bucks . That's a small problem to a giant. I hope that if you're wanting something Cheap but Good, you will take my advice and choose this. Trust me you will be happy you did I sure am!!!","Date":"November 1, 2011"}

PC tech input:After taking a look at this Dell Latitude D600 I was already concerned about the price she had paid of $150.00 for a machine that is hardly worth that even in mint condition.Upon inspection of this unit I had discovered all 3 of the batteries the seller had given her were bad.  One of them even had the word BAD written in permanent marker.  She even complained about the faulty battery and they sent her another faulty battery to remedy the problem.After further inspection of the machine the internal hardware wan not as stated, product description states a 30gb HDD is included.  30gb isn't alot to begin with but is ample amount of storage for documents and a decent amount of photos and music.  This unit was equipped with a measly 20gb HDD.Furthermore the overall cosmetic condition is Par at best, they have been so kind to include some sticky pleather material on the LCD lid to cover up the huge gash and any other cosmetic blemishes you might not like.I peronally have refurbished well over 50 laptop machines in the past year and know that from a recycling facility these guys couldnt have paid more than 25-30 bucks for this unit, bought a square of pleather from JoAnnes for a dollar, jacked up the price $120 and called it a day.He is probubly some loser who lives in his moms basement for free and needed some more beer money.

Damage I hope was from shipping.  It appears to have taken a hit on one corner and hinge to screen is toast ( New one 6.47 amazon ).  Took a hit to the top HUGE dent, and a hit to the bottom guess where .. Wireless bay, Straightened and reset card .. still not functioning (1.20 to 12.00 amazon ).  Battery ( 18.00 amazon ).  I realize its used.  But what a disappointment.  Should have kept saving for new laptop.  I hope the card is the problem and not the mboard to which it attaches.

At first I was happy with the performance. As time went on, I became very frustrated with it.The first problem is the fact that the power cord fails. I have had to trade my power cord in 4 times in the last year because it has failed. My colleagues have had to do the same. If I had to pay for the power cord myself, I would have spent a lot of money. This is very frustrating.The other flaw is the video. I am not sure if this is the driver or the hardware, but I find myself constantly moving the screen back and forth (open to close) in order to see the screen. What happens is that the screen will occasionally have lines through it that impedes the view. I can't see anything. Sometimes it comes back, but on other occasions, I have to reboot.On a positive note, I like the feel of the keyboard. It feels very sturdy.I hope this helps.","Date":"September 7, 2010"}
{"Title":"this is my 2nd tablet pc","Author":"J. Veteran \"tabletlover\"","ReviewID":"R2AJRM2HI3DLSU","Overall":"good","Content":"11-22-2007 Update - my second TX1320US has the same problem as the first one. This model has, in my opinion, a factory defect. Avoid purchasing. The defect is in the wiring harness that goes through the swivel mount and causes audible clicks to sound through the speakers when manipulating the display. You can position the screen so that the clicking repeats like someone playing a snare drum roll repeatedly.  HP blew it big time on this 'tablet' which is not a true tablet, it should be called a 'touch screen laptop' as it has no synaptic pointing device.  I'd downgrade this to a one star but Amazon  has it set up so you cannot change your original rating.  What follows is my original review:This is my second tablet PC. I'd say my experience so far is mixed.  After 12 days of use I'm going to need to exchange it for another one as there is an electrical short in the swivel mount for the screen.  The laptop makes a very loud audible, \"clack clack clack clack\" noise when the screen is positioned at various angles.  The noise comes through the speakers and can be induced or stopped instantaneously by screen angle (tilt the screen 45 degrees towards you as if you were closing the lid and stop - and the noise is heard).I am almost greatful that the screen is acting up because I was disappointed by the response of the space bar in the keyboard. I type 70 wpm and never have an issue hitting 'space'.  However on this keyboard I routinely find that the space bar did not recognize my input forcing me to backspace (as I type this about every 10th space has this issue).My 3rd complaint is the tablet stylus.  I was an early adopter of the tablet, purchasing the very first Toshiba model when they first came out around 2001'ish.  What I noticed immediately about this tablet's stylus is the lack of a spring to the tip.  My first tablet was very responsive to different screen pressures, and it was easy to know how much pressure you were applying to the screen because of the ability to push with varying pressure.  The default stylus that ships with the HP tx1320us is just a piece of plastic with a permanent type of tip. It feels harsh and unresponsive in comparison to my first tablet's stylus.Once my exchange is finished (and should I decide to keep this laptop) I will be looking for an aftermarket tablet stylus which is unfortunate because the docking cradle for this laptops stylus is really well done.The laptop feels quick and responsive within the VISTA OS and the screen resolution is decent.  The fingerprint swiping mechanism really needs an overhaul however because it hurts to drag your finger across it. It has very sharp edges.Overall I'd give this a 3 out of 5 assuming you don't get a lemon like I did.(note I did an 'even exchange' on this laptop and got an identical one.  The new one has a responsive keyboard and no shorts or problems with the swivel display mount.  I did find out though that I will never get the reponsiveness I thought I would get from this tablet due to the fact that the screen is not interactive with the stylus in the way that many tablets are.  A much better name for this laptop would be TOUCH SCREEN laptop NOT Tablet Laptop...Microsoft and HP and screwing up the 'TABLET' branding by allowing this type of device to bear that name).","Date":"November 11, 2007"}

{"Title":"Very Impressive","Author":"R. Layne \"Luv2Read\"","ReviewID":"R2CS4E0IS5MQD5","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm not a gamer so this review may not be helpful to those who want a computer to play games.I have worked as a professional software developer/architect for 17 years.  I started with MSDOS 2.0 and have ridden the Microsoft wave all the way through Vista 64 and I had a few years with UNIX.  I have personally owned or worked with computers from Dell, HP, Compaq, IBM.  I have heard of Apple products but for the most part dismissed them as more toy than tool.  (I was not alone in this perspective.)  I like Microsoft but after working with it for the better part of 20 year I decided to look at something different.I never thought I would purchase an Apple yet here it is.  I am impressed to say the least and I see Apple as a serious tool that also makes a cool toy.Pros:Lightweight - Probably the lightest laptop I've ever worked with or ownedSolid - Normally when you get laptops at 15.4 or larger, chassis flex becomes evident as you can see them bend and they creak.  Yet because of its single piece construction and light weight aluminum the MacBook feels good when you need to move it.  I doesn't creak and there is no noticeable bend when lifted.Battery Life - It just keeps going, and going, and going...  Actually I am seeing up to 4 hours life on the fully charged battery.  My previous computer never surpassed 1.75 hours.Size - It is very thin and carrying it around is very comfortable.  I had a 17\" and while I like the large display its uncomfortable to carry like a book.Magnetic Clasp - When closing the lid the owner is rewarded with a very solid thump instead of a \"creak\" \"clack\" that you hear from so many other laptops that use a plastic display and mechanical clasp.  Opening the monitor is equally a pleasing.  You place you thumb under the lip and lift.  The laptop may slide a little on smooth surfaces but the lid comes up smooth and controlled.Keyboard - This is a great piece of work.  Does it have \"Home\", \"Page Up\", \"Page Down\", the legendary \"Any\" key?  No.  Doesn't need it.  A little research and practice and you will find that these \"missing\" keys are functions of the keyboard and I don't miss them at all.  Secondly the keyboard \"key-float\" (that rattle you hear when you lightly stroke your finger back and forth over a laptop keyboard) is almost completely non-existent.  So when you're typing it doesn't sound like your wadding up crinkly plastic and you don't annoy your neighbors.  The key throw is short but very pleasant.  Another thing I like about the keyboard is that you don't feel like you will break the keyboard if your touch is a little heavy.Display - The display is a work of art.  No only does it look good, but flex has been reduced to almost nothing.  It feels very solid and you don't feel you need to worry about tilting the screen from the corner.  The glass cover over the LED lit LCD display is awesome.  You can actually clean the screen without LCD screen colors distorting.  Not to mention that is automatically dims in low light and the key board lights up in the same low light conditions.  that's a nice touch.  The display brightness is every bit as bright as my desktop LCD display in strong light.Touch Pad - Any who has tried to use the touch pads on other computers (I hate them generally) will love this touch pad.  It works like the iPhone (except scrolling is reversed for obvious reasons - you're not actually touching the screen).  The touch is light and very smooth.  Making the entire touch pad the button is brilliant, it took me almost no time to get use to it and now I nearly push a hole through the Dell touch pad before I realize I have to click the buttons.  I have no trouble with inadvertent touch that moves my cursor away from where I'm typing.Quiet - I have yet to hear the fans.  It makes me wonder if they ever work.DVD Superdrive - Finally!  No cup holder comes sliding out of the side of my laptop.  Just simply slide the disc in and your done.  It operates like the CD player in a car.  It is easy to eject from the screen or a key on the keyboard.Fit and Finish - The best I've ever seen.  The only thing I've seen is a very slight misalignment of the Express Card/34 slot door.  But you really have to look close to see it.Operating System - WOW.  Fast, no anti-virus, stable: it just works.  I won't get too much into the OS but I will say that once I understood how Apple likes things done OS X is very appealing.  Not to mention that it sleeps and wakes up faster than anything I have ever worked with.  Open the monitor and it's sitting there saying \"come on, I'm tired of waiting for you\".Built-in Accelerometers - Not sure what they're good for, but they're cool.  Like the iPhone the MacBook Pro has three accelerometers.  There is an Stanford Laptop Orchestra uses MacBook Pros to make music using these accelerometers.No Fresh Air Openings - I really dislike fresh air ports on the bottom of laptops.  They are easily plugged and they suck fuzz and dust into the heat sinks.  With my previous computers the fresh air ports were placed underneath the computer right where it sets on your legs.  The result was you ran a big risk overheating the computer.  The MacBook Pro pulls the cooling air through the keyboard and therefore has a smooth bottom making it far better to place on you lap.CONS:Chassis - While it is a brilliant piece of engineering there are a couple very minor issues.One:  Always pick the computer up with both hands.  While this is true of all laptops you want to last, it's a little more important with this one.  The metal around the ethernet port has been machined very thin which was necessary to fit the large jack in the rather narrow side of the laptop.  So if you have the monitor open and grab the laptop with you left hand and your thumb over that jack you could dent the metal around it.  It doesn't warp or twist the whole chassis, it's too strong but you could see a small indention in a otherwise straight piece of metal.Two:  The metal in the Battery/Hard Drive Cover is very thin and sometime appears to hang below lip of the chassis.  You really have to look to see it and it isn't all the time.  I don't think is is warped or bent, but just the natural flexibility of aluminum.Touch Pad Click - While I absolutely love the touch pad (in fact I only use a mouse anymore when I am programming on it because of the nature of the software).  If you try to click at the top of the pad (nearest the screen) the force required to click goes up quite a bit.Price? - Not really a Con.  Some have complained about the price.  Three and half years ago I paid $5700 for a Dell 9100 laptop (All the bells and whistles, Window XP Pro, Office Pro, the works).  It has been a great computer that has been put to pasture and my family uses it.  I've only had two problems with it.  The dreaded mexican jumping keys (a key flies off the keyboard after you press it down while typing; AKA broken key) Dell replaced the keyboard without any trouble and the hard drive crashed and needed to be replaced.  The Dell computer when new cost more than twice the MacBook Pro does today and the only thing it has over the Mac (old age and technology not withstanding) is it's 1920 x 1200 pixel display compared to the Mac's 1440 x 900 display.  If I were to order the most power 15.4 laptop Apple sells today, I would still pay half the price of the Dell and the Apple does much more and has better quality overall.To summarize this is an accomplishment that the engineers, designers, and developers should feel proud.  There is some room for improvement but these improvements are at a level that other laptops have to improve a great deal just to achieve Apple's shortcomings.I could go on further but I think this is enough.  Apple has truly developed a great product in both hardware and software and I recommend it highly.","Date":"December 10, 2008"}
{"Title":"Worth the Extra Money Compared to MacBook","Author":"Charles","ReviewID":"RJEIFE17ZKIWV","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple's site and other reviews provide the essential information on what was upgraded in this new MacBook Pro (two graphics systems; machined from solid aluminum; new industry-standard DisplayPort video out; new trackpad; other minor changes/upgrades).But why get this computer rather than the much less expensive MacBook that appears almost identical?1. The MacBook LCD display is poor. It is not just a smaller version of the MacBook Pro LCD display. It has washed-out blacks, poor contrast, limited viewing angles, and less vibrant colors. This is a huge difference. I confirmed this with a side by side comparison in the Apple Store (and the store staff member agreed), and you can find further discussion at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review).2. The MacBook Pro's excellent new graphics chip (NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT) can be used to speed up all operations (not just graphics) when the new Apple operating system (Snow Leopard) is released in January. This is not confirmed, but there is substantial discussion online suggesting this is the case. The 9600M is essentially a 32 processor computer (running at 120 gigaflops). So, a MacBook Pro will actually gain in speed over time. The MacBook does not have a separate graphics card that can work this way.3. MacBook Pro graphics are twice as fast as MacBook graphics, so if you do anything visual with your computer (digital photography, video, games, etc.) then everything will run much more quickly and smoothly. Some games that are just barely playable on the MacBook become fun and seemless on the MacBook Pro.4. The MacBook Pro has a firewire port (omitted from the new MacBook).5. The MacBook Pro has an expansion card slot (really handy for adding a memory card reader or 3G roaming internet).So, for the extra $400 (MacBook 2.4 GHz vs. MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz) you get a lot of extras that you will notice and use. And you will avoid the poor LCD on the MacBook. You are still stuck with the highly-reflective glass screen (if my eyeglasses can get anti-reflective coating, then why not this computer screen?), however, so it's only four stars until they solve that problem.","Date":"October 19, 2008"}
{"Title":"New macbook, new hardware, awesome","Author":"D. Perkins","ReviewID":"R1PXY1HA39YG2Z","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple is notorious for constantly updating their products, more or less to keep up the status quo on their products.  The new Macbook Pro is no exception.  This beautifully constructed laptop is a work of art in many ways in which i will detail.SCREENThe MBP has had a beautiful screen for as long as i can remember and this new model is no exception.  LED lit means that it is \"instant on\".  when you open the lid, there is no warm up time like there is with other screens like LCD ect.  The colors pop and are extremely vibrant and true.  If you have seen an older MBP screen, you've seen them both, kind of.  The new screen is all glass.  The glass extends to the very outer edge of the lid, leaving no empty space.  Simply put, you can't find a better screen, not even on a Sony machine (and i love sony also).KEYBOARDThe new MBP has an updated keyboard.  The first thing you will notice is that the keys are black as apposed to the old silver.  The black adds a nice touch because it accents the silver case.  If you ask me, the old MBP had too much silver.  EVERYTHING on the machine was silver aluminum.  Don't get me wrong, i loved the old MBP, but this is just one step up.  The Keyboard is also backlit so when you are in a darker environment, the keys light up, helping you see anything and everything on the keyboard.  The Keyboard is absolutely beautiful on the machine and adds a nice touch overall to the look.TRACKPADI find it weird that i can put an entire section on a review about a laptops trackpad, but this is undoubtedly necessary.  The new trackpad is ALL glass and there is no button---per say.  In reality the entire trackpad is the button.  They took off the button on the bottom and extended the trackpad down to give you more real estate.  Apple spent months designing this trackpad and i have to give them major credit for that.  recently me and my friend were looking at laptops at Circuit City, and one thing we did was go through every single laptop and look at it's trackpad.  It is absolutely amazing how much time and effort company's DON'T put into designing their trackpad, when in my book, it is a HUGE factor.  The coefficient of friction on this trackpad is exactly what it needs to be.  not too rough, not too smooth, just right.  I absolutely love the MBP trackpad and think it is something apple needs to be commended for.GRAPHICSApple and NVIDIA joined up and came up with a new video card for this MBP.  The MBP actually has 2 graphics cards in it.  One that is integrated, and one that is dedicated.  The integrated graphics is NVIDIA instead of the old intel, so it is immensely better.  The dedicated card (which can be easily switched on) is a powerhouse and almost puts a MBP in line with other gaming machines, almost.  Needless to say, this notebook will do just about whatever you want it to do graphics wise, gaming, video editing, photo editing, you name it, it will do it pretty easily.  no worries here.OVERALLoverall this laptop is at the top of it's class and you might be wondering why i gave it 4 stars and not 5.....first and foremost, money.  I have to say that this is still overpriced.  You are paying for a collection of things like the operating system, graphics card, high end components and things like that, but come on apple, 2000 dollars is a lot to drop on any laptop, no matter what it is.  Is it worth it? without a doubt yes, and that is why apple can jack up their prices, but at the same time, it seems like they are kind of taking advantage of us, especially in the economic slum we're in right now.  Maybe i am just cheap (which i don't think most people would classify me as that) but that seems a little high to me.  And another thing.  what is up with the new display port?  i have a 46 inch samsung tv and i will be hooking it up to my MBP but the cable is 100 dollars!!!! and that is just to dual link dvi----i still have to buy a dual link dvi to HDMI adapter after that. Ugh.  apple (along with other company's...cough cough monster cables) is completely ripping us off on their cables and that makes a difference in my outlook on the big picture.CONCLUSIONThe new MBP is absolutely stunning in every aspect of its design.  Apple continues to wow us, and they will also continue to prosper and grow.  I will be enjoying my new Macbook pro and i hope this review helped you in any questions you might have had.  It is an investment that will live for a long time and will be greatly enjoyed every day.  good job apple.","Date":"October 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"The Good, The Bad, and the Shiny","Author":"Robert M. Brown","ReviewID":"R21IXVOXMC9GO1","Overall":"good","Content":"The new MacBook Pro has some significant advantages over the old one.  The new case design is attractive and solid.  The keyboard is crisp and responsive.  The hard drive is as easy to access as on every other notebook on the market (as opposed to requiring complete disassembly of the machine with the old model).  The new NVIDIA 9600 graphics adds a lot of 3D horsepower.There are some significant drawbacks as well.  The video output for connecting an external monitor is only compatible with one monitor at the moment.  Connecting to the kinds of monitor that people actually own will require the purchase (and carrying) of an additional $30 adapter.  Or two, if you need to connect to both VGA and DVI monitors.The new MacBook Pro actually has two video adapters; the NVIDIA 9400 and 9600.  The system uses the 9400 by default, which is less powerful than the 9600 but uses less power.  The 9400 is an integrated adapter without its own memory; it uses 256MB of the system RAM.  The problem is that it uses that 256MB RAM even when the system is using the 9600 adapter.  In other words, these laptops effectively have 256MB less RAM than the previous generation.The new display is very clear and sharp, at least as good as the previous generation's screen.  It is also covered with a pane of glass and is very, very shiny; much shinier and more reflective even than the previous generation's 'glossy' screen.  If the lighting conditions in your work environment are exactly right, the screen looks wonderful.  If there is any light behind or above you, the screen acts as a mirror and the glare and reflections can be very annoying.The new MacBook Pro is a wonderful computer, but it is not a clear upgrade from the previous version and the mirror finish of the new screen means that no one should buy this computer without actually trying it first.","Date":"October 27, 2008"}
{"Title":"PC to Mac Convert and lovin' it!","Author":"OPsDad \"New Media Consultant\"","ReviewID":"RZVBPREDQN47E","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a long-time IT professional with enough certifications (mostly Microsoft) to make a large can of alphabet soup, and this is my first Mac.  I had played with a few of them here and there years ago, and never saw what people liked about them.  The closest I ever came was back in the late '90s when I was tempted to run Windows on a PPC, but just about the time I was going to do that, Microsoft pulled their support for it from Windows, and that ended that.So, I was anti-Mac for quite a few years.  All that has changed.  I began to believe in the OS when Apple began to base it on Unix.  A solid, time proven technology that I trust.  The big thing that changed it all for me is VMWare.  For 70 dollars, I have the ability to run Vista Ultimate, XP, and Ubuntu Linux on OSX. My Vista Ultimate is my previous Dell (not a slouchy box, either).  It's a complete clone of my old computer.  Windows still shows it being a Dell!  Spooky.  Windows had it a 3.6 rating, and a retest of the VM on my Mac shows a 3.6 rating.  That alone earns 4 of the stars I give this machine.Now, here's another reason why I'm so happy.  I put Office 2008 on the MBP, and I seldom have any reason to even start the Vista VM anymore.  The last two times I did, it was only because I miss the great Vista solitaire game.  That earns the fifth star -- I'm not \"homesick\" in the least.  I think I'll be staying right here on planet Mac.  As a matter of fact, I got a MacBook for my wife, I liked this MBPro MB471LL/A so much!  Bought her the MB403LL/A.I use it with an external monitor about 90 percent of the time, so the glare of the glossy screen hasn't been an issue for me.  The built in screen is gorgeous, and I've not been in a situation where glare became an issue.This machine is truly desktop horsepower in a gorgeous carved aluminum notebook chassis.  I'm a very happy camper.","Date":"November 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"Rus Healy","ReviewID":"R2E6RNZS44RJ92","Overall":"good","Content":"In more more than 25 years as a computer \"power user,\" this is the first Mac I have ever owned. I had never considered Macs to be relevant to me in several key ways, including the proprietary, non-Intel hardware and lots of \"funky things\" about the old Mac OS. However, I had also become dog-tired of the Wintel boondoggle--machines needing to be rebuilt on a regular basis, blue screens, virus hassles, etc, etc. Supporting family computers was even more of a pain. \"Dad, what does this error message mean?!\" <sigh> Clearly Macs are now a viable alternative for technical business users (okay, they have been for a while), so I took the leap even though the hardware is very pricey, competitively speaking.I'm absolutely delighted with this purchase. Everything just works. Although I'm still finding my way around in some areas, I am reveling in the joy of a human-use-oriented user interface. I installed VMware fusion based on my comparisons between it and Parallels, and on my experience with VMware on other platforms. I exported my work machine with VMware Converter and imported it into Fusion. Works great. Performance is at least as good as it was on the old machine (2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM)--and stability is much better. Integration of Windows apps into OS X is excellent using Fusion's Unity mode. I have not had to revert to my work-issued HP laptop even once since making the jump.The only challenge I had, and it was minor, was installing the RAM upgrade. I bought 4 GB RAM at the same time as the machine because I wanted to have the full memory capacity, especially for business apps and VMware Fusion. The upgrade isn't difficult (unlike the Mac Mini!), but it does take some care and two sizes of small screwdrivers to complete. Eight screws have to come out, and four of them are quite small. Take care to keep from dropping any of the smaller screws into the machine when you're reinstalling them. Cover alignment is also important to get just right, or the battery/HDD hatch doesn't close properly. As with any project, put all the screws in before tightening any of them.Unlike other reviewers, I have not found the high-glare, glass display to be a big problem. Glare is sometimes an issue but reorienting the machine slightly minimizes the inconvenience. The display is gorgeous, very much in keeping with the overall product design and quality. The glass trackpad is excellent, with intuitive, tunable multitouch features. The MacBook Pro runs much cooler, and quieter, than any laptop I've used over the last 5 or 6 years as well. The milled aluminum case is both rugged and attractive, as well as providing a great heat sink for the high-heat components.In the wish-list department, I would appreciate having more than two built-in USB ports, although I can migrate at least one device to FireWire to take advantage of that port. Also, the front edge of the base is slightly uncomfortably sharp for resting my hands or wrists. Lastly, I find it annoying to have to buy a $20+ adapter cable to connect an external VGA monitor. The adapter cable is also too short--but this isn't a review of the cable. All that said, these issues are not enough to drop my rating below five stars. This is an outstanding laptop. I like OS X enough that I have already added a Mac Mini as the family machine, to rave reviews among its three primary users. How can you beat that?","Date":"November 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"Go With The Pro!","Author":"Brandie Woodward \"Spock4Pres818\"","ReviewID":"R14GH6D5ZJDBYD","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased the pro yesterday at my local Apple Store.  I have had it for less then 24hrs so far, and I love it.  I was going to get the high end Macbook, and then at the last minute decided on the low end Pro upgraded with 4GB of Memory.  I am so glad I did.  It is so fast, and powerful.  The display is what made me make the final choice.  It is still very portable.  It weighs the same as my black macbook, and is thin.  It would be very easy to just to throw in my backpack and be on my way.  Also the firewire.  It was going to be the easiest way to transfer all my data from my old black macbook to the pro.  It only took and hour and a half, and I have all my information.  I didn't have to do anything, just started it up and began to play.  I didn't have Leopard on my old one, and I love it so far.  It is easy and the graphics and set up are great.  I love the stacks options, and the lighted keyboard.  I also love how the controls for the dashboard, screen brightness, keyboard brightness, and dvd controls, are right on the keyboard.  I was in between which laptop to get also because I am a casual gamer.  However, the salesman did tell me that I could still play some of the games on the Macbook.  The display alone is what I am enjoying the most.  It is definitely worth the extra money to get the pro.  Highly Recommended!  I didn't get it from Amazon, or order it.  I wanted to look at the computer before I purchased it.  From reading all the horror stories on the web about people receiving damaged, or broken laptops from both the Apple Store and other retail stores.  I would also recommend if you are going to get a mac, go to the Apple Store itself and get one if possible.  They are so helpful, and usually give you some kind of deal when purchasing one.  They will also set it up for you, but transferring all your information to your new computer is very easy to do by yourself.","Date":"November 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Switching From a PC to a 17\" MacBook Z0G5 128GB SSD","Author":"John Robertson","ReviewID":"RPYM6PU8IIAXD","Overall":"good","Content":"As of this writing, I've noticed that Amazon is mixing all MacBook Pro reviews together, regardless of the model you searched on to get here.  This is for the Z0G5, which is really just the 2.66GHz MB604LL 17\" with the 128GB Solid State Drive option.  Although I have used Apple/Mac products over the years, this is the first time an Apple has been my number 1 computing device.  I'm including details for those used to the PC environment, so those already familiar with Apple, please be patient, as I wanted to help weigh the pros and cons of switching from Windows.SUMMARY=======This, quite simply, is the nicest computer I have ever owned or used since starting with them in 1979.  It is not for everybody, if only because of price, but if there is something you are used to doing on Windows XP or Vista, this will probably do it, and do it faster and more reliably.GOOD====* Bootup/shutdown times - benchmarks are somewhat relative, but my 6 year old HP ze5400 P4, and 5 month old dv7-1130 core-duo, both will boot XP Pro to a usable state in just over 4 minutes, including effects of anti-virus software and initial browser launch.  Using the same licensed copy of XP Pro for this MBP, it boots in an incredible 25 seconds, every time.  This latter time is a full boot-up -- no hour glasses to wait through.  Shutdowns average around 4 seconds on the MBP, compared to around 30 to 45 seconds on the above mentioned Windows laptops.  You can also run Vista32/64, Linux, Unix, Sun and other OS using VMware Fusion, which runs within the Leopard OS -- this is absolutely terrific software, and if you set it to full screen, you will be hard pressed to tell if you are running a pure Windows OS, although Fusion will only devote one of the two Intel cores to Windows.  This latter point is quite amazing, when you read about how fast Vista boots on other MBP's (see other Amazon reviews in April 2009).  You can allocate the majority of the included 4GB of RAM and almost as much as the hard drive/SSD to these guest OS' as you want.  For just Leopard, the native OS, boot and shutdown times are comparable, and of course, that's for just that OS -- it has nothing to do with Fusion or guest OS's.* Screen - having just come from a near-new HP dv7-1130us, which also has a glossy 17\" screen, well, there is simply no comparison.  I'm not being an \"Apple snob\" here.  The MBP offers a much sharper and more colorful image.  Personally, the occasional glare is a worthwhile trade-off for the image quality, but I spent almost 2 hours in a local Apple store comparing the glossy vs. anti-glare side-by-side, and I almost picked the anti-glare, extra $[...] cost notwithstanding.  Unless you are really concerned about the final few pixels of 130dpi resolution which the glossy screen seems to bring out, or the pop-out color of the glossy, the anti-glare is just as good, and almost fully eliminates any trace of glare.  I could have been happy with either.  Also, when running XP in VMware Fusion, you can set the screen resolution to a ridiculous 5210 x 3200 ! (not native of course, but the even the 1920x1200 is better than any WSXGA+ screen I'm aware of)*  Battery power - I've only run on battery for 4 hours at a time, but I would estimate usable power for up to 6 hours, with occasional wifi use and uninterrupted word processing.  I do think it's POSSIBLE to get the 8 hr time, particularly if you get the flash hard drive and 2.66GHz processor, but you have to allow all power saving options, reduce screen brightness to absolute minimum, etc, so that practically, this is just a laboratory spec.  However, I have never owned a laptop that did better than 3 hours -- so this doubled that.* Keyboard -  I have come to really like the keyboard in only two weeks, although I do miss having a backspace key.  Apple die-hards may know something I don't, but without backspace or an 'end' key, I find I am re-positioning the cursor a lot.  However, the track pad almost compensates for this.  When set for single-tap, this is the best track pad I've ever used.  I never accidentally select or click items anymore.  Right click is done with two-fingers, and is less effort than actual 'right-clicking'.  Windows hotkeys, such as alt-tab, ctrl c, ctrl v, etc. work when running XP.  I dislike the sharp edge towards the front of the laptop, and I'm a little surprised that Apple picked form over razor-blade-function by not beveling this.  But, this thing is a MacBook Air wannabe - it is very thin, and the pressure on the wrists still isn't as bad as other laptops I have used.  Too bad they didn't round it like the bottom edge.* SSD speed and response - currently, going to the Solid State Drive (NAND flash memory) is a $[...] premium to a 7200RPM hard drive, and that only gets you 128GB, of which you will have around 93 usable GB after getting your Mac with Leopard, iLife (included) and in my case, iWork loaded on it.  I keep photos and large files on a couple of external HDD's, and use an online backup service for really important business files, so trading off speed to lower capacity was very worthwhile.  In fact, I'm getting in the bad habit of not shutting down, but just putting the MBP to sleep and stuffing it in my bag while it's saving files -- it doesn't matter with SSD.  I've read about benchmarking SSD to HDD, small files vs big files, etc, etc.  Frankly, it was all meaningless once using it for real.  It's expensive now, but in 5 years, we will all be using SSD.* iWork and TextEdit - these will open .doc, .xls, .xlsx, etc.  You may not be able to edit all the features of Windows productivity software using Apple's own versions on their own, but you can still do many things with iWork, and you can always view any Microsoft-format files.  I was stunned at some of iWork's templates in Pages and Numbers.* You can share files between the Leopard and Windows OS (or any other guest OS) using shared folders.  You can also select to share files between different users or not.  This reminded me of using LAN shares.* Blue screen?  What's that??  Cheekiness aside, I can lock a Mac if I really try, but I have not done so yet on this or it's guest XP Pro OS.  Just a pleasure to use.NOT AS GOOD===========* 2.66GHz vs 2.93GHz for an extra $[...] - I'm being a little less than objective here, but looking at bench marks for the MacPro desktop, and talking with Apple Genius reps, I concluded the 2.93GHz processor only adds about 5 to 7% more usable processing power.  Feel free to offer your opinion.* Occasional lag - this has happened 3 times in two weeks -  I think this is due to the guest OS and tear-down of memory ranges.  It's not that obtrusive, but after getting used to the normal speed of the laptop, it's a bit of a surprise when it does happen.* Trash bin - no restore.  I have researched this and as incredible as it will sound to Windows users, you must manually restore unintended deletions yourself to whatever folder it came from -- not very helpful if you were typing/swiping quickly and didn't see where you unintentionally deleted something, or you are unfamiliar with Mac directory trees.  I have read some borderline-snob opinions about this, but it's a serious oversight that should not be joked about.  Most of us can identify with your hands tiring and inadvertently dragging a file or folder to the Trash.  Or sometimes small creatures known as children get a-hold of your treasured, $[...] device and use it as a Fisher-Price xylophone set.  I've been around some very brainy, Product Development Engineering-Fellow-types for years, and they are sometimes guilty of convincing themselves that removing features like this are explainable, acceptable, and only weak or stupid people would ever complain.  I guess I'm weak and stupid.  Frankly, I don't care.  Stupid people still seem to have a lot of money, (more than average, I have observed) so unless Apple likes perpetual 12% market-share, they should and will have to match certain, select attributes offered by competitors.  Again, if I'm wrong, I'd welcome being set straight on the issue.* Caution: Slippery When Dry - dry hands may not always grasp the super clean, smooth aluminum case, such as when going through airport X-ray security with hundreds of people jostling you.  I purchased the 3 year warranty because of this (although damage in such circumstances still may not be covered).* Warranty - at $[...], it's a little expensive.  I didn't know this when purchasing, but if you buy a 24\" monitor with the MBP on the same invoice, then the warranty also covers the monitor.  Except that, by definition, if you don't buy a monitor, then you're overpaying for a warranty that was priced to include one.* You may need new hardware and/or software - much of it which is not cheap.  One reason why VMware Fusion is so wonderful is you can load Window-based apps like Office and use your existing license.  Apple currently throws in iLife, and if using only Leopard, you don't typically need anti-virus software.  Some Apple hardware, like RAM, is designed only for Apple computers and does cost more -- even if you buy it from a third-party retailer.* ExpressCard 34 port - I really will need an eSATA port.  Unfortunately, reading some Apple reviews indicate that many commonly-available Express34 eSATA adapter drivers currently do not work reliably with the MBP.  I normally don't put too much into a few bad reviews here and there, but this does seem to be a genuine problem with the MBP as of late April 2009.  Driver updates may correct.* Price - it has to be said:  This is still just a computer.  Once you add truly comparable hardware, the price difference is not quite as disparate as many believe...perhaps $[...] for a premium, all-flash, all-day-battery Windows laptop to a $[...] MBP.  It's easy to fall into a trap of just counting USB ports, of how much DDR3 RAM you get, but I'm also referring to native screen resolution for a portable device, or color balance, stability, security vulnerability, etc.  If the MBP advantages are worth it to you, chances are you already know. I just broke the TFT display on my 5 month old HP dv7-1130us laptop, which also had a dual-core, 4GB DDR3 RAM, etc., which lead to this MBP purchase, but believe me -- and I'm not trying to jump onto an anti-Vista kick here -- the PC was painful to use.  Slow, alarmingly buggy, and poor legacy support.  Even after downgrading it to XP and upgrading to a 7200RPM HDD, performance was still slow slow - slower than an old single core, P4 with 1GB DDR RAM.  Specs aren't going to show you how fast this MBP boots.SOME FINAL THOUGHTS===================Use the MacBook Pro a little bit, and it grows on you all the more.  It seems different, but familiar hot keys, print screen, display and wifi settings, etc. are all still there.Apple still reminds me of how computers used to be in the 1980's -- things are already laid-out for you, and you do it the Apple way, and if you don't like it, get used to it.  PC, which really was a semi-open standard that began with Microsoft OS running of IBM PC's and PC clones, could be configured many ways.  Like so many things, what makes it open also makes it complicated, with clashing interpretations of standards.  Testing keeps systems reliable, but it is always the most expensive part of developing anything (I know, I can thank my career for it).  As a result, testing is usually where cost-cutting must be performed. Next time you curse Vista, remember, Microsoft engineers cannot solve issues due to third-party designers.  They will always be in reactive mode because Windows is relatively open.Apple chose to make the day-to-day settings for you, and telling many peripheral designers \"here's how your printer WILL talk to our computers\", etc.  It's potentially less flexible, and will slow third-party software and hardware development because it is more expensive to design and test with Apple.  Ironically, this is disorienting to us Windows users.  We are so used to controlling and setting everything, that an Apple computer seems too simple, and even that control is lost.  This really isn't the case though.  Virtually everything you can set in Windows can be manually set in a Mac.  But what I've found over the last 2 weeks is, why would you want to keep adjusting anymore?  I know it's their current slogan, so apologies, but the Apple really \"just works\".  There's no need to get into setup menus -- set once and forget.The last time I used iMac G3's or the original MacIntosh, I enjoyed them and remembered a few of my former PC-peers who said they would never switch back to a PC.  I'm not quite sure I'm ready to say that yet, but the MacBook Pro 17\" is the first Apple computer I'm willing to test that notion on.UPDATE:  Sept 15, 2009======================This is just a fantastic computer.  This is what impresses me almost daily:* Speed.  Same boot-up/turn-off times.  It does not gradually slow down with use like Windows.  Leopard and now Snow Leopard respond very fast. Running XP in the virtual is awesome because I almost never shut-down....I just suspend it.  In doing so, XP basically restarts in seconds.* Display -- Love using screen capture (command, shift, 4) -- much better than Print Screen.* RapidWeaver, Pages, Numbers - awesome templates.  Nice alternatives to the familiar ones we've seen for 10 years.* Ease of updates - fast, automatic and they do not bog machine down while loading.  They also are not co-dependent or prerequisite.  They just all download and install at once.* Battery life.  On just Leopard, 1/2 brightness screen, working on say a website while listening to iTunes, I get an honest 6 hours.  You probably could get 8 hours as I once got 7, but that's the dimmest setting and running only 1 app.  Still, I never take my adapter for the day.  The batteries outlast me.* Time machine is actually pretty cool.  I quite a back-up hound, and had just done what I always did with manual dragging of files to an external drive but TM works very well.Occasionally, there are problems, though in all honesty they do not cause much grief...but in the interest of disclosure, here's what I've found:* About 1 or 2 times per month, I have to Force Quit something.  Problem is usually seems due to a 3rd party driver or app.* Creating a new folder places it at the root of the directory tree, not in a subfolder you've highlighted.* No FW400 port.  I'm not sure...maybe there's an FW800-to-400 adapter.  But I could have used this a few times now.* Could not find a way to reverse the data series on a Numbers graph.  Geniuses at Mac store couldn't figure it out either.  There might be a way (in fact, it's there buy greyed-out...why??).* I dont' like iTunes lack of Realplayer-format support like .ra and .rmj, and greatly wish I could just see a directory tree of songs that I can shift-right-click and select.I don't know how Windows 7 will compare yet.  While it's still important for me to have the legacy support of XP on VM Fusion, I find that I'm using it less and less, almost completely relying on speedy Snow Leopard, Numbers, Word, TextEdit and Preview.  Dialog boxes are also rare (mercifully).  If you are really watching money (which would include 99% of us), obviously you'll have to wonder about those $[...] HP laptop blowouts you see.  However, after just playing around with the dv7 or my friend's HP d8000, I would really recommend you try a small MBP 13.3 or 15\" and at least compare, although it still does take time to learn certain keystrokes and features if you're only a Windows person.  Personally, though, I'm hooked.  I don't think I could go back to a plastic, bendable and slow laptop again.","Date":"April 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"Macbook Pro/Leopard convert","Author":"JJ Casas \"jjcasas.me\"","ReviewID":"R37LR6ZSNJJNKT","Overall":"good","Content":"Finally took the bite and bought my first Apple computer. I'm a photographer and needed a new laptop since my old Gateway one was slowing down.. and since I've been eyeing an Apple since then, I finally purchased one after seeing the new one [I'm writing the review using it right now.]First things first: it just works. No clutter, no unnecessary backgrounds running in the background, simple and definitely sleek. I'm still getting use to the file management since it is different but otherwise, a lot of the programs I've used on Windows are available on Mac.:Design:It's really light for a 15\" laptop! And definitely thin too.. although it's not a cutting edge Macbook Air thin, it's definitely thin enough for easier transport. The all aluminum design is stunning. It's solid and feels sturdy. The keyboard is just right with its chiclet style keys and has enough tactile feedback.. not too loud either.:Screen:It's glossy and yes there is glare. Since I do photography, it's probably not the best screen to edit on but the colors and text and all is really good. It's a bright screen and makes pictures just look good.. too good as a matter of fact [opinion shared with another photography Joe McNally].:Trackpad:It's weird at first but it's really like a regular trackpad.. you place your hand as if on old trackpad and you'll naturally figure it out. Nothing really different but the space of the trackpad is really generous and I'm sure other manufacturers will follow suit.:Performance:I've yet to get bogged down after running Photoshop CS4, Lightroom, iTunes, and Firefox at the same time. So I have no issues just yet and will see later on if I'll need to upgrade to 4gb since I have the standard lower end version of the Macbook Pro.Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase and i'm sure this will last me quite a bit since I've had my Gateway [tablet] for over 2 years.","Date":"December 1, 2008"}
{"Title":"Beautiful computer, some mixed feelings","Author":"Jacek R. Ambroziak","ReviewID":"R1P8JNZVCBFHR7","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Apple computer ever. I am a software developer who mostly used Unix (Solaris) and Linux, rarely venturing into Windows land mostly for Nikon Scan and Photoshop. For a long time I believed Macs were for graphics/video designers, rather than hard core developers. The fact that I've seen lots of MacBooks at conferences such as Web 2.0 in SF, did not convince me enough: I attributed the widespread use of them to a fad, a certain \"style\" as in clothing. For me a computer is a \"knowledge worker's tool\" not a fashion statement. Another reason to stay away from Apple products has been high margin pricing. CPUs, GPUs, memory, disks, are quickly getting cheaper, and yet Apple sells these commodities like luxury goods. One can configure a beautiful Lenovo laptop with more horsepower for much cheaper (I've done it recently for a friend).So why do it?Here are MY reasons. 1) I needed MAC OS X to port some of my applications to the Mac, maybe go into iPhone development too. 2) I needed *some* laptop (for mobility) to replace my historic trusty Dell Inspiron 8000. Most of my work happens on a custom built desktop. 3) I am not much of a Windows fan and I am a bit tired of Linuxes; I wanted inspiration from something I haven't used before: to learn and expand knowledge/experience horizons.So that's where I am coming from...After 3 weeks of usage I can say the following (you will notice the mixed feelings from the title of this review)This is a computer of *stunning* beauty! It is a work of art: the screen, the keyboard, the body; it belongs on a permanent exibition at the MoMA. As such it is a joy to use and have around, it brightens my daily experience. And yet... why such a small screen resolution (1440x900) for a 15 inch screen?! Even my historic Dell from 2001 sported 1600x1200, great for working with text and hi-res photos. For this kind of money we should be getting higher resolution. I am not talking about numbers for numbers' sake: the font characters (even as I write this) are far from print quality, issues with anti-aliasing software may have something to do with this. Within the first couple of hours I practically decided to return the laptop because of how text looks 70% of the time. It is difficult to understand why Apple is saving on pixels here and impairs an otherwise great product. Is it because higher resolutions are reserved for even pricier models? Apart from the not-so-great-a-resolution (you may google around for other people's opinions on that), pricing is somewhat annoying too (and also discussed in many places on the Web). To connect an external monitor you need a $30 or $100 additional cable. To upgrade to a much more reasonable 4GB of RAM you'll need $100+ (or $300 if you want this commodity to have Apple sign on it :-) )But... I decided to keep the laptop. It is too beautiful, and I find MAC OS \"Leopard\" intriguing and a good experience. Then there are other pluses: the keyboard (back-lit w/ smooth key action), great network connectivity, convenient weight and dimensions, glossy screen (I don't have issues with reflections other reviewers mention). From the developer's perspective, I learn some good things and some not so good: apparently I can't just download my Java from Sun (say 32-bit Java 6); I have to live with what Apple endorses :-(Amazon/UPS delivery was fantastic, packaging is beautiful too: they both made for a very pleasant and exciting experience.Summary: I am not returning the laptop, I enjoy its beauty and functionality, but if I didn't need MAC OS for my planned work, I would have stayed in the higher value priced PC-land (eg. Lenovo + Ubuntu) where you can customize parameters better and avoid hefty margins.A FEW DAYS LATER: With MiniDisplayPort to DVI adapter (another $30) I connected the laptop to my 1600x1200 Sony LCD monitor. The text characters can still look pretty bad, eg. equals sign = with grey area between the horizontal segments. The bad news is that the higher resolution did not heal the issue: the good news: perhaps this is a software issue to be solved with a system update -- I hope.","Date":"January 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"They finally converted me - Bye bye Vista","Author":"TN_legend","ReviewID":"RLK6OYNPQ09PD","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Mac - Ok let me start by saying I had been an Anti-Apple for years, I also work in IT and work a lot with Microsoft products still. So you wanna know what happened? Vista happened, as a big ex-Microsoft fan I bought a new laptop(HP) the week vista was released - I am not a new user so I understood there will be bugs and I need to give it time, same thing happened when they released Windows XP. ok after 1 + year of vista:  Man, system was still SLOW, ok no big deal added 2 more GB of memory but its still SLOW, programs not responding, and a security pop up pretty much for everything I tried to do. You click on a short cut and wait and wait and wait and finally it opens now the program is not responding so you have to wait and wait and wait. LIFE IS TOO SHORT!!! Then I heard Microsoft is releasing Windows 7, I was kinda pissed, I just spent $$ to upgrade to vista ultimate and now they are releasing a new windows?? that quick?? Fine so I went to Microsoft.com and get into Windows 7 beta. in the mean time I always owned blackberrys phones and it was the time to upgrade my old phone (blackberry curve), looked at the blackberry storm and man that thing stinks comparing it to the Iphone so I gave up and bought an Iphone - and WOW what a great experience I have had with it, the phone is just great and the APP store alone beats any phone out there - anyways going back to Windows 7 - Ok Microsoft can fool people naming it windows 7 but its Vista with some changes to the interface, same problems , very slow, and more system requirements than vista so basically if I want to experience Windows 7 at its best I have to buy a new laptop with a better graphic card. I then looked at the new Mac OS requirements - Yeah 256 MB of memory, you know what does that mean? it means people who bought an apple in 2000 can run the latest OS while for me to run Windows 7 I have to buy a new laptop that is less than 2 years old, same thing when vista was released couldn't run vista on a 2 years old Dell so had to buy a new laptop. that did it for me - I was done and decided to switch to mac and oh my god what a different experience I have had - It just AMAZING, I love every second of it - the system is so quit its hard to tell its running, it doesn't get hot like HP/dell did, the battery actually last longer than 2 hours. its just what a laptop should be like and the mac experience is as good as it could get, you turn this laptop on and the start time is less than 1 minute - you click on a short cut and the program runs immediately - I can run 9 different programs on it at the same time and not notice any slowness - try that with vista and you will see a nice blue screen + and no need to worry about virus or spyware.Yes this machine was more expensive but you know what? you really get what you pay for. Go to an Apple store and try a mac if you think about switching, trust me - you won't be sorry and you would never look back","Date":"April 1, 2009"}
{"Title":"Amazing but not without it's flaws, those hoping to use bootcamp for Windows may be disappointed.","Author":"TeamReveal","ReviewID":"RNYSSVR6Z6XHH","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my very first Macintosh computer. Earlier this year I bought an iPod Touch and I felt and still feel it is the most amazing pocketable gadget around, so since I was in need of a new computer I became highly interested in buying my first Apple computer and I went with the Late '08 Macbook Pro.After a month of daily usage I think I've had enough time to form an unbiased opinion of the computer's achievements and shortcomings.The first thing you'll notice is that the Macbook Pro's glass display is understatedly amazing. There is something about the glass enclosure that gives everything a certain purity. All screens have some type of film over them, whether that be gloss, matt, or simply a glass enclosure. Each of these films have a different refractive index of light and thus look different. What that means is that even if a manufacturer uses the same exact screen, the quality of the screen will be affected by what type of film protection they use.The Macbook Pro's screen is super bright if needed, and whites are blinding white while blacks are deep and rich. Colors come off as appearing very rich and watching blu-ray movies is a real treat (yes you read that right, more on that later) The viewing angles are also better than most laptops, but like any TN panel they are limited. Comparing this screen to my 2 year old Toshiba Satellite's screen shows that the Macbook Pro isn't as good at dithering colors. If I head over to the Lagom LCD test website, my Toshiba shows all of the steps in contrast for the various colors while the Macbook Pro blends in the last 2-3 squares. For daily average use and movie watching the Macbook Pro is easily king, there's no competition between the two so I'm not saying the Toshiba is better but it does dither colors better. This may be important to you if you are looking to do important detailed photograph work on the Macbook Pro, but then again I don't know of any professional who would do important work on any laptop screen.After a  month I feel pretty comfortable in OS X and I can definitely see why some people love it so much. The way OS X maximizes a screen to optimal width is superior to windows way of needlessly filling the entire screen. It did take a week or so to grow accustomed to this as I constantly wanted to fill the entire screen for no real reason, windows habit. Now I wish windows would maximize windows the way OS X does. I also love the fact that I can visit websites in safari without worrying about getting hit with a virus. In Windows I was constantly worried about visiting unknown sites because I didn't know if they had malicious code in them. More than once in Windows was I hit with messages from my virus scanner warning me that a website was trying to install malicious software. In Windows you have to \"browse defensively\" while in OS X you just have to worry about not downloading and installing malicious software. As far as the rest of the OS X GUI experience, I do feel that it is better than Windows but really, I don't feel there is anything wrong with Windows.If you're an unknowledgeable computer user who constantly has problems because of viruses then I believe you should get a Macintosh because in my experience most computer problems are virus related, something OS X is almost immune too. Personally, I'm a fairly knowledgeable computer user and have never actually had a virus in my computer, the closest is being warned by my virus scanner that a website was trying to install malicious software.Going back to hardware the Macbook Pro is an amazing engineering feat but you do pay for it. It is possible to get the same basic internal hardware for hundreds of dollars less. When I say same basic internal hardware I refer to the CPU and GPU which determine the performance, how fast, your computer can run. There are features in the Macbook Pro that you will not find in other notebooks. The magsafe power adapter is a neat feature, I absolute love the trackpad in OS X (hate it in Windows, but more on that later). Engineering the laptop to fit in an enclosure that's less than an inch thin is unnecessary and so is building it from a single piece of aluminum. No other manufacturer packs so much power in such a small and light frame because of the cost involved. It's these types of details that drive the price of the Macbook Pro up, but it's these details that ultimately lead the Macbook Pro to look and feel like a luxury laptop. You can buy a Toyota or you can buy a Lexus for much more. They both accomplish the same tasks but one delivers it in more style and luxury. If you're looking for the most raw power for your dollar then the Macbook Pro will disappoint but if you're looking for a laptop that looks and feels luxurious then you are in the right place.Now back to software and some of my disappointment with the Macbook Pro and OS X. I'm starting an online masters program this coming Spring and a website called Angel is not supported in Safari which means I'll have to log in to Windows to use it. They will also be using a few Windows only applications which means more Windows. I will also have to turn in assignments in under Microsoft's Word and Excel extensions and as I previously only used windows my copy of Microsoft Office is for Windows only so I'll most likely have to incur another expense and buy this for OS X. I have bought VMWare so I can run Windows within OS X but I am a bit disappointed with its sluggish performance.  I also like watching blu-ray movies, this works under boot camp and by hooking up an external blu-ray player, playing video games is also another windows activity. Sure you can play games under OS X but Windows is superior for game availability and performance. One unexpected disappointment is that I feel OS X's font smoothing is not as good as Windows. Text in Windows looks sharper and is easier on my eyes, I've change some settings in OS X's appearance tab to improve things but I feel text looks better in Windows. Some people tell me they feel text is easier on the eyes in OS X for them so this will be a very personal preference for you.So why did I buy a Mac when I needed to do so many windows only activities? One is because I was enamored with the iPod Touch's abilities and because of the amazing screen on the Macbook Pro. Most importantly, I was hoping to run Windows on the Macbook Pro just like I would on any non-Apple laptop. While you can run Windows under boot-camp it is not an ideal experience. For one the notebook runs very hot under windows. In OS X using the 9400m the notebook barely even gets warm, using the 9600m in OS X the notebook does get warm, but in Windows you can only use the 9600m and the notebook gets not warm, but very hot. You can feel the heat coming off the notebook as you type and it is a little uncomfortable. Metals have a low specific heat capacity (a term for us chemistry nerds) so since almost the entire notebook is made from aluminum you really feel the heat coming off.Also, the trackpad in Windows is trash. Often times I have to click 3-4 times for it to register the command, right clicking barely works. Enabling \"tap to click\" helps the clicking matter a lot but then you get the problem of accidently clicking by accident when you type. The trackpad is a big generous size but that means your palm will rub against it. In OS X the software is smart and knows when your typing so it ignores your palm rubbing against the trackpad and has not been a problem, not even one incident. In Windows I'll get accidental input several times in just a paragraph. While you type you'll all of a sudden delete a paragraph or a word somewhere because it accidentally registered a click and a highlight somewhere. Disabling \"tap to click\" is the only way to remedy this problem and connecting an external mouse is the only way to avoid punching your fist through your screen.Another problem is that you can't completely turn off the backlit keyboard under windows. A third problem is that the wireless card interferes with the sound card. Windows checks for new better wireless connections every 60 seconds and every time windows does this you get a sound crackle through your speakers (external or headphones) and a lag spike (terrible if you're playing online video games). Install a program called Vista Anti-Lag mostly solves this but not entirely. When I'm watching a movie I simply disable the wireless card to avoid sound crackling.All of these issues except the heat issue is a driver problem and something Apple can fix by writing proper software for its hardware in Windows. Apple actively advertises boot camp and the ability to run Windows on their computers so I feel it's only fair they properly support their hardware under Windows.  I follow forums quite a bit and I'm not the only user experiencing some of these problems. Apple so far has said it's not a big enough issue to bother solving. I wasn't aware of all of these issues under windows, but had I known of them I might not have ordered the Macbook Pro because as I stated before I simply don't have the option to not use Windows anymore. Face it, it's a Windows world we live in.Another thing I realized after buying a Macbook Pro is that you really are at the mercy of Apple when you join the Macintosh side. With Windows you have a large amount of notebooks to choose from. Don't like HP's notebooks? No problem you have at least a dozen manufacturers to choose from. Also, being in a Windows world means it'll be unlikely to come across software that is Macintosh only without a Windows alternative, not true the other way around. What brought all of this to my mind was when I first saw a Macbook next to a Macbook Pro. The screen on the Macbook is trash. It looks washed out and the colors are anything but vibrant. The Macbook Air on the other hand has a very nice screen, why Apple can't put that screen in the Macbook baffles me. Comparing the Macbook to windows laptops in a Best Buy stored shows that windows laptops costing half of what a Macbook costs had screens that were vast superior. What this means is that if you are in the Macintosh camp and you want a laptop with a nice screen you only have the choice of the expensive Macbook Pro. On the other hand if you are on a tighter budget the Windows world can offer you a nice screen at a low price. Switching from one operating system to another isn't easy either when you invest in software.On a bit of a side note, the first notebook  I received from Amazon came with a faulty superdrive but returning it was easy. I don't think this is a real big deal because all manufacturers will produce a few notebooks that are faulty, but I thought I should mention it.If you don't need to use Windows often and really want a luxury laptop then I think you'll really love the Macbook Pro. If you need to use windows often and can deal with a bit of slow performance under a virtualizing software like VMware then you should be happy as well. But if you need to use Windows often and need performance (even low intensity applications like Microsoft Word are a bit sluggish under VMware) then you should think long and hard about buying a Macbook Pro. Don't expect a windows experience as good as a dedicated windows system.Still I gave the Macbook Pro four stars. Overall I do find it to be an amazing experience under OS X but I hope software support increases or at least that Apple gets it's act together and offers better drivers for windows. I think the day that you no longer need to use Windows to accomplish a task for work or school is the day to mark the history books as the fall of Microsoft.","Date":"December 14, 2008"}
{"Title":"Very elegant and powerful","Author":"Ron Miller","ReviewID":"R3IYXYLC3FX8MQ","Overall":"good","Content":"My 5 year old 17\" Powerbook G4 was showing signs of age so I decided to move up to an Intel based MacBook Pro. Additionally, as a Mac developer, I needed an Intel mac to update my apps to Universal Binary.I have been a Mac user since the G3 days so have a wide base of comparison. I still have 4 Macs in use in the house. Anyhow, this MacBook Pro is the best of the lot by far, well not by far compared to the 17\" Powerbook but still much better.I was a little concerned about comments re the glossy screen. No problem! It clarifies screen images, and protects as well. The black bezel acts as a frame that contrasts and brings out the beauty of screen images.The black keys and the back lighting system works wonderfully in this machine update. Positive comments about processor speed, the two video cards, the multi-finger track pad set up and the elegance of OSX 10.5.6 can be found in many other reviews. Additionally, the machine is very quiet and runs cool except for the most arduous computing using the 2 video card option.My only disappointment is after using a 17\" sreen for 5 years, the 15\" screen seems a bit tiny-but is is so much lighter the tradeoff is worth it.I highly recommend this product for both the professional and the casual user.","Date":"February 21, 2009"}

{"Title":"Stellar build quality, Superb software","Author":"terrance005 \"terrance005\"","ReviewID":"R3DXX5I7FDOLW9","Overall":"good","Content":"The unibody construction definitely adds to this notebook's durability and reliability.(Actually, it's 4.5 stars, but there are no half stars.)The keyboard takes a couple days to get used to, and then you realize you can type on it at normal speed.  It does not feel mushy.Yes it comes with Firewire, which has been dropped from the unibody Macbooks.  No doubt because USB 3 is going to come to the industry and that is rated at 10 times the speed of USB 2.  This, and the more Apple uses industry-standard components the cheaper they can make their products.  Still a bit sad though, cause Firewire is actually superior.iLife (included software) is GREAT (photo management, make movies, create music and learn to play an instrument, publish and manage websites).iWork (purchased separately) is a refreshingly elegant, and more user-friendly re-think of wordprocessing and page layout, spreadsheet, and presentation software.  Note that Apple Mail comes with the machine.  You don't need to buy iWork to get e-mail software.  A Windows PC often does not come with Microsoft Outlook- you have to buy that or MS Office separately or use the free e-mail software called Thunderbird.The integration, seamlessness, and ease of use set the Mac apart and ultimately make you more productive.  (Far more productive than any difference in Gigahertz with a Windows machine.)  I used Microsoft Windows for 12 years and will not go back.  This is a superior platform with far fewer glitches, weird things, and security/virus/spyware issues.  Most Apple software you can use without buying a big book on Amazon on how to use them. [The money that some people save on buying a PC, often goes towards buying software similar to what comes BUILT-IN on a MAC, or to software for securing the machine (e.g. Trend Micro, Norton Antivirus), or speeding it up (e.g. Diskeeper disk defragmenter).  Furthermore, the security software on a PC often reduces performance by 10-20%.]I get about 2.5 hours battery life typically, and though that is about normal for notebooks (in general) with my kind of activity, (web, music, e-mail, movies, wireless) it really is not enough.  6 hours would be very good, and *8 would be perfect*.  I hardly use the DVD superdrive (about 10 times last year), and would MUCH PREFER IF APPLE USED A BUILT-IN BATTERY (like the MacBook Air or the new 17-inch MacBook Pro)  AND, THAT THEY REPLACE THE OPTICAL DRIVE WITH MORE BATTERY.  The MacBook Air has this, but is a no-go for me because of the smaller screen and resolution, and the 17\" is *for me* too big for lots of lugging around or use on a plane in Economy class.  As long as Apple bundles an external slim optical drive with the system, many people should be fine.*Aside*:  We should actually be getting physical content on Secure Digital (SD) Cards, and  SDHC (SD High Capacity).  Mechanical optical drives are so last century... including Blu-Ray.  Noise, scratched disks, skipping, misaligned heads... all those problems disappear.  It's a monumental shift like going from VHS to DVD.  Those little cards like what go in a camera can replace CDs, DVDs, AND Blu-Ray.  Imagine just slipping one of those into the side of a TV in order to watch a movie.  No need for separate Blu-Ray players and cabling, and this method uses far LESS ENERGY.  I really think this can be done... more and more people's content is purchased and downloaded or streamed anyway.  And an SDHC reader can be inserted into the ExpressCard slot of the MacBook Pro, further eliminating the need for an external optical drive.To reduce heat, noise,  and increase battery life and ruggedness, I am also eager for them to use Solid-State (no moving parts) Drives as standard on all MacBooks instead of mechanical hard drives.  However, you can get it now as an option.  If you have the money, get it (128 GB is available for the 15-inch; and 256 GB, or 128 GB are available for the 17-inch.)Make sure to cover your bases and get the Extended 3-year Apple Warranty.  You'll get peace of mind, and fast service from Apple.Finally, iLife and iWork shine with MobileMe [...].  Get MobileMe.  Yes you can backup to an external HD or Apple's Time Capsule, but it's in the house with your computer.  For true backups you need to have it offsite.  MobileMe and the iDisk will give you this (20GB).  Also, you can backup to 64GB flash drives such as those by Kingston.  [More reliable than hard disk, consumes less power=more battery life, and light enough that you can easily carry a backup (not your only backup) with you.]iWork.com allows you to share and collaborate with your documents similar to Google docs.  Note, currently iWork.com is not quite up to par. Also, it is a separate subscription to MobileMe, though it is free for trial/demo.In sum: an excellent machine with excellent Hardware, Software and Service and with exciting possibilities for the near future.","Date":"February 7, 2009"}
{"Title":"17\" MacBook pro delivers on high expectations","Author":"Robbert Patrison","ReviewID":"R3ATWQEKBLZ06X","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using my new 17\" unibody MacBook Pro intensively for over a week. It has hold up to the high expectations that I had from it. The design is stunning: the solid aluminum body is offset by a pitch-black screen. When closed, its a sleek minimalist work-of-art that looks smaller than its massive 17\" screen size. The top lid and bottom aluminum body fit perfectly, sealed like a fridge by a magnet and a slim rubber edge that runs around the entire display. Its gorgeous from any angle: the back is flush has no battery bay and there are no visible ventilation holes. The fan exhausts are intricately hidden in the hinging mechanism of the display. The fans are barely audible under normal use.Putting the unibody in on your lap after a cold night is a boner-shrinking experience. Also when powered up the MBP runs cool, consuming only 18 watts in normal use. Battery life is about 5 hours if you only do some office work. That is probably as good as it gets today. Battery life is considerably less when the graphics is stressed, or when I boot it in Windows Vista instead of OSX. I noticed that the battery life predictor never gets even close to the promised 8 hours. Apple marketing is quite simply lying.The display is stunning: the sharpest and best contrast I've seen until now. The colors and sharpness of the glossy screen is visibly better that that of the matte screen (a $50 option). In contrast to the glossy screen, the matte display is not mounted flush into the case. Side-by-side, the glossy looks a lot better. I noticed no problem with the reflections of the glossy screen in heavy daily use.Performance is good. Subjectively it seems faster and more responsive than my daughter's Imac. The system wakes up within a few seconds after opening the lid. My previous Dell tool a full 2 minutes to fully wake up after sleep, and much longer after a cold start. That is a real productivity saver.Of the 5 laptops in my home (of different vintage and make), the MBP seems to have the best and most solid WIFI connectivity. It picks up base stations that are out-of-reach of the other machines or Iphones.There are some minor design flaws: the front edge of the laptop is quite sharp. This is where your wrists rest, especially  when using the trackpad.  By now I've gotten used to this S&M; experience with cold metal, but its clearly a case of form-over-function.Another flaw is that the beautiful design of the lid forces the connectors to the side instead of the back of the laptop. When placed on a desk (which is 95% of the time),  a wild assortment of wires sticks out on the left, taking up precious real-estate on my desk. Since external displays require a adapter, the mess is even larger. Apple does not provide a docking station so my daily routine involves plugging in and out 5 wires multiple times. Apple uses a nonstandard video plug that require one to schlepp around two extra adapter cables anywhere. I would have gladly sacrificed the entire DVD-drive for this, since that is only used to install software.I've installed Windows Vista in 2 flavors: running in parallel using VMWare fusion, and sequential using bootcamp. Vista is a sluggish, slow and clumsy operating system compared to MacOS, so the latter is my preferred mode of operation. Fusion is faster and more convenient, but its only flaw is that it does not support graphics well (Flight simulator X did not work).In short, the 17\" MBP is probably the best (and certainly the most beautiful) laptop one can buy at this time. Its considerably more expensive than similarly equipped competitors, but it makes up for that by better components and better design.","Date":"March 24, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dripping with Awesome Sauce","Author":"Brad Marx \"The Doctor\"","ReviewID":"R1U8SF6C30YC4J","Overall":"good","Content":"In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that my last laptop was an Acer Aspire 1640 (budget laptop) and that this is my first premium laptop. So, you can take my gushing with the appropriate amount of salt.That said, I really love the new Macbook Pro. It is a big plate of fantastic smothered in awesome sauce.-Multi Touch-While you won't be pinching and zooming all your apps or flicking windows around, multitouch scrolling, expose and right-click/CTRL-click all work really well. In fact, I held out from buying a Mac laptop because of the one button silliness. No buttons however, works like a dream. And the mutlitouch trackpad is pretty configurable to boot. I configured it to recognize a 2 finger tap as a right-click. It has spoiled me. I have a hard time using laptops w/o multitouch now.-Battery Life-They weren't kidding about the increased battery life. I get about 5 hours of design/coding/surfing time. I'm sure that watching videos and listening to music would impact that noticeably. But compare my 5 hour battery life to the 2 hour life of a friend's last gen Macbook Pro under the same usage. BTW, I have not changed the default performance settings or screen brightness for battery powered usage.-Display-The glossy screen may urk those used to a matte screen but I have always had glossy so it doesn't bug me. Aside from that, the screen looks great and seems on par with other glossy laptop screens--not noticeably better or worse really--and the color on it looks pretty good with no calibration. The black bevel adds a certain something to the experience and makes the screen feel bigger. There is a setting \"Automatically adjust brightness for ambient lighting\" which is on by default. While ingenious, for me, it fell into the too clever for their own good column as it made the display brightness change rapidly in any situation where the light was not consistent--such as a coffee shop where people frequently pass behind you blocking light. So I turned it off.-Mini Display Port-While it's great that the new display port allowed them to make the body slimmer or whatev, I have to say it stings a little knowing that I need a $30 dongle to hook it up to an external monitor while my buddy just plugs it in. It doesn't help the feeling knowing that previous generations of mac laptops (like the iBook) came with such dongles for free. Additionally, the DRM that is built into this port almost made this laptop a deal breaker. Not that I watch movies on external displays that are not compliant. I honestly don't even know if I own such a device. My problem is that DRM is such a ridiculous waste of resources and having it built into the hardware offends me to no end. To. No. End.-Other Thoughts-The performance is great even on battery power and even with a lot of apps open. The new body is very cool. It feels very sturdy, like all Macbooks, and looks really slick. I love the back-lit, black, chicklet keyboard that lights up based on the amount of ambient light. I also really dig that the new Macbook Pro is more environmentally friendly than the previous line and the packaging that it comes in is barely bigger than the laptop itself.This laptop is definitely the most awesome that I have ever used with only the aforementioned display issues holding me back from calling it absolutely perfect. Apple scores again.","Date":"February 12, 2009"}
{"Title":"Reviews from a Geek's perspective","Author":"Bhushir Mankad \"bhushir\"","ReviewID":"R3H7EOSWXH2PAK","Overall":"good","Content":"The experience of owning a mac, versus owning a PC are far different and the Mac wins hands down when it comes to providing the best 'customer experience'..For me, buying the Mac from Amazon was a risk since I live in Dubai and used temporary PO box in the US to get my Macbook Pro couriered to Dubai.. But it arrived all in one piece, and its working great...Speaking of the experience, right from the packaging (the white box as opposed to the conventional brown carton for a laptop), to the intro video of the mac OS X leopard, the Mag safe power cable with the magnetic latch, the ease of setting the OS up etc... it was all a breeze.. (my laptop arrived via courier at my office address, and i set up my system during lunch time.. less than 30 minutes flat)with regards to built quality, this thing is rock solid.. the aluminum unibody is robust, and you feel you're holding a block of metal.. no sqeaks, loose ends.... its pretty amusing to know how stalwarts like HP and Dell never thought of building a robust machine when it came to build quality.as for the performance, on paper the specs might not seem earth shattering, and there are a whole lot of other laptops that give a standard 3 GB ram and everything. But no one seems to be reading the fine lines. The frequencies of RAMs are higher, the caches are bigger, the chipsets are from nVidia (an intel chipset + nvidia graphic processor is a much slower option as compared to an nvidia chipset and nvidia graphic processor).in short, the hardware mix of the Macbook Pro (and the Macbook) is optimised to deliver performance with high amount of stability.. From the looks of it, all the hardware is tested to inter-operate seamlessly before the product is released into the market... before the mac I owned an HP, and the wireless device just used to konk off..! i have changed my motherboard thrice during my warranty period (HP service centres have been really helpful in this regard)as for software, OS X is certainly better, more intuitive, smooth and intelligent than Vista.. Vista is just plain paranoid, where it asks you every time you run a .exe file. Not to say that things dont hang in OS X.. things like Firefox do once in a while (rarely), but you can 'Force Quit' them and carry on with your other work.. unlike in Vista, where in all probablity you might have to restart the whole system..I use Adobe PS, InDesign, and Illustrator all together, along with iTunes running in the background, and Firefox downloading something or the other.. and all of them work like a charm.. and Expose+Spaces is like the icing on the cake.The whole 'all button' trackpad has met with a lot of criticism, but it really doesnt make a whole lot of difference.. i mean, if you're used to pressing buttons towards the bottom of the trackpad, do it by all means.. it will still work.. there's a right click too for those shifting from Windows..I run Win Xp SP2 on bootcamp.. and there's this only 1 MAJOR regret that have as far as MBP and MB goes.. I play a lot of games and they run beautifully on XP on mac using boot camp.. but for some weird reason the fans dont start spinning at higher speeds when running XP. and the GPUs clock temperatures upto 75-80 degrees C, which isnt really good..i use smc fan control for now, and tried using input remapper, but my Mac used to hang the moment i used Input remapper on XP. And this is the only reason why i gave it a 4 out of 5.. Else i'm a happy man..Hope this helps..Cheers.","Date":"February 2, 2009"}
{"Title":"MacBook Pro is a wonderful machine","Author":"The  Musician Physician","ReviewID":"R1LJNOWY0JWOL6","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a physician specializing in Radiology and an experienced computer user.  I spend most of my day working with images, voice recognition, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS).  I was the physician on the committee that selected the enterprise wise PACS system we use at three hospitals in North Carolina. At work I use several work stations and at home with wife and children we actively use five windows computers.Recently, I was looking for a laptop so as not to have to share our Dell 600m with the family.  I was considering a loaded windows laptop from Dell or HP but I was attracted to the Mac family because of all I had heard about Mac and the included software.  I polled a dozen friends and acquaintances  and all but one suggested I try the Mac.  Boy were they right.  In one evening I created a website for my band Ad Nauseam [...] using the included iWeb software.  I have also used garage band to take my live recordings and split them into separate songs then dropping them into itunes and burning CDs for my friends.  Yes, I could do all this on my windows machines, but it is so easy on the MacBook Pro.  You pay a premium for the tight integration.  I am less frustrated and more productive with my  MacBook Pro.  I have not yet installed software that will allow me to run windows programs in parallel with my Mac programs.  This will be important if I want to have one machine for work and play.  I understand that others have been successful doing this.Adding the MacBook Pro to my home network and wireless N+ (Belkin) router was a snap.  I can watch streaming video and download videos via Miro with ease.  Safari and Firefox are fine internet browsers.  Last weekend the children and I had an \"iChat\" with my sister and her family in CT for almost an hour.  The kids love seeing each other on the web cam and once again it was so easy to perform with the included, integrated software.I chose the 15\" version because I thought the 17\" might be to large on my lap.  With young kids around, I felt I might be more apt to have an accident with the larger one.  I did opt for the faster CPU though not sure how significant the difference between the two processors is in practice.Apple Care has been very helpful in answering my questions in a friendly and understandable way.  I bought the 3year apple care protection plan elsewhere for about [...].In short, I highly recommend the MacBook Pro for anyone interested in using a laptop for anything more than email and internet browsing.  I will  give the machine 5 stars when I get around to putting my work software on it.  My wife and I were surfing on our laptops together last night. I'm just waiting for her to ask for her own.","Date":"January 21, 2009"}
{"Title":"Simultaneously gorgeous and utilitarian","Author":"Paul Cantrell","ReviewID":"R1CGNMKK86410N","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple's update to their laptop case design is really magnificent. The new machines have a much more rigid, substantial feel, and appear to be much less susceptible to the torquing and bending that could afflict the older ones. And it's exactly as beautiful as the photos make it look.The performance is excellent, and jaw-dropping for somebody who came from a nearly 4-year-old Powerbook. I got this souped up 2.53 GHz configuration because of some of the work I do on the machine: developing very RAM-intensive imagery software, and audio recording and editing. If you're not doing something like that, and if you're not a hard-core gamer -- if you're using the machine for word processing and email and maybe iPhoto -- just get the 2.4 GHz. You won't notice the difference. Even if you do need the RAM or the hard drive, but you're not a gamer, you may not care about the improved graphics card. Consider ordering the 2.4 from Apple and upgrading the RAM and HD on that configuration. It will come out about $250 cheaper. I was going to do that, and bought the 2.53 instead only because it was on sale! (Still haven't received my rebate, although it hasn't quite been long enough that I'm concerned. But I have my eye on you, Amazon.)I was worried about the glossy screen, but find that I love it. Yes, it is *very* glossy -- but it's also vivid, extremely sharp, quite amazingly bright, and takes no time to reach its full brightness. The brightness easily overwhelms any more moderate reflections. I find that reflections rarely bother me. Surprisingly, it's usable in direct sunlight -- more so than previous Apple notebooks, in fact. The one situation where it's real trouble is when the sun is directly behind me or shining on me: then the reflection is bothersome. If your work setup is like that, be warned!The new keyboard feels great. It has a more solid, less squishy feel than the previous MacBook Pro. I find the touch pleasantly reminiscent of the original Titanium Powerbook, which always felt great to my fingers. My only complaint is that I can no longer press cmd and option simultaneously with one thumb; I am having to get used to new fingerings.The trackpad's increased area is fabulous, and the feel is great. The click, however, is distractingly loud. At first, having the whole thing be the button was a bit disconcerting, but I quickly got used to it and now like it better than the original. The two-finger right click is genius. Note that you can touch the trackpad with two fingers and then click with your thumb to get a right click! Much easier than their demo. The three-finger gestures are more or less useless; the four-finger expose gestures are more practical.The laptop is very slightly wider than the older model, which meant that I had to get a new case. I recommend Tom Bihn's \"Brain Cell,\" which protects against both dropping and bending, and fits inside your backpack (the vertical version) or briefcase (the horizontal).If you have any Firewire 400 devices, note that you do NOT need to buy an adapter! There are cables that go directly from FW 400 at one end to FW 800 at the other, and they eat up a lot less space.My only major complaint is really about the price of cables. The Mini DisplayPort is wonderfully small, and I see why they ditched DVI for it. The adapter cables, however, are ridiculously expensive! Furthermore, you can't just get a Displayport-to-DVI adapter and then plug your existing DVI-to-VGA into it. Doesn't work. Instead, you have to get a separate Displayport-to-VGA cable. Blah. Somebody needs to start making some generic adapter cables so that Apple can't get away with charging $30 for them!Despite my minor complaints, this is a magnificent machine -- and miles ahead of any other laptop in terms of both beauty and functional design.","Date":"December 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"Amazing machine","Author":"Smart Little Magpie","ReviewID":"R11A3T2ESFND8U","Overall":"good","Content":"I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","Date":"December 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"C. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows","Author":"Eagle Vision","ReviewID":"R3L7OKJPVR55VJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!","Date":"December 30, 2008"}

No longer for creative Professionals","Author":"Nick \"CellGeek\"","ReviewID":"R1YV1AYHEWP7TH","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"So much to say...","Author":"Scott D. Espenschied \"ScoDal\"","ReviewID":"R2VGRT0I45JFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.","Date":"December 14, 2012"}

This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.

Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

{"Title":"My 1st Mac...Love it!","Author":"J. Buck","ReviewID":"R296B1VMD0A6G2","Overall":"good","Content":"After looking and researching for a long time I decided to switch to mac. This review is for the Macbook Pro 2.4 GHz and 2GB RAM. This is my first mac and I have had very little experience with mac before this purchase. I have had this computer for a few weeks now so I feel like I can provide an accurate review.Design: Absolutely beautiful! It seems like they really thought everything out. The magnetic latch and magnetic power cord are genius and very nice features. The computer does seem very sturdy and well built.Screen: I know many complaints are about the screen and it is indeed reflective. HOWEVER, I have yet to have a problem with reflection and the screen is vibrant, I love it.Hinge: I have read complaints on the hinge being too weak. I have not experienced this with mine and would say the resistance is about perfect. I can tip the computer at a very steep angle without the screen falling.Trackpad: This was one feature I was a little concerned about. I did experience a few problems with the trackpad but the update from apple fixed that. I can honestly say this is probably one of the greatest features of the machine. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the gestures and not having a dedicated button. Now, I feel like all other machines should have this trackpad and I really miss it when I am using other machines.Keyboard: This is a personal preference but I love the \"Chicklet\" style keys and it feels great. The backlight is nice to have also.Performance: This machine is fast! I have the Adobe CS4 Design premium loaded on the machine and it handles it with no problem. All other programs open and run amazingly fast. I have yet to have any problems with performance. Also, the machine is very quiet and stays cool. Battery life seems to be fine but I have not really put it to the test.Compatibility: I have yet to experience any compatibility issues. I do have Windows XP running through VMware Fusion 2.0 and it works pretty good (Separate review for this product). All my electronics and printers just worked...sure is nice.Value: So far I am very happy with my purchase. The machine runs great, looks great, and I am happy that I made the switch. I do not miss my PC at all. You will pay a premium for a Mac but it is a premium product. If you want a excellent computer and are thinking about this machine, I would highly recommend purchasing one.I was debating between the Macbook and the Macbook Pro and I am glad I went with the Pro. The extra screen size is very nice to have and the machine is not all that big.","Date":"December 22, 2008"}

{"Title":"15 year PC con-vert to Mac. THIS model MacBook made me do it.","Author":"Kevin Quattro","ReviewID":"RYB98AZ7KNOB6","Overall":"good","Content":"What can I say? Maybe it's my age catching up with me. I am not sure. I know that I was just tired of all the mess there is in keeping a PC up to date and always running. Drivers, inter-application support, all of this is just something PC owners deal with and have gotten use to. I'm tired of it.I found the iLife suite of applications a perfect answer for everything I needed. iPhoto, iMovie and of course iTunes (which I was already using on the PC along with my iPhone) are just a joy to use. iPhotos \"places, faces and events\" are super cool. And it's amazing how easy it is to get photos in and tagged. Everything about OSX just flows easily and never gets in my way. Everything works together smoothly and nothing competes with each other. i.e. WIndows Photo Viewer and Media Player both wanting to manange your pictures and videos DIFFERENTLY. Typical PC reply is \"oh just download this other app and install this service and then run this codec pack and set this registry entry and you're all set'\"  NO...I'M DONE WITH THAT. iLife and OSX WORK.Now to the hardware.I liked the previous generation MacBook Pro. It was missing some things though for the price. For one, it seemed to not really offer much in build and features I couldn't get elsewhere much cheaper in a PC laptop. This was not to say I would buy a PC but it meant I was looking at the MacMini or possibly even the iMac. Something I didn't really want to do. I wanted a laptop. So I waited. Another year with the PC...then finally these new ones hit.I was blown away by the features videos and when I got to handle one in person...WOW. They are thinner yet completely SOLID. Picking one up or just smashing the keys and you feel like you're using something God would use. I can rest my fat palms on the faceplate without worry. The new black backlit keys are MUCH easier to see and feel great! The buttonless touch pad (the entire thing is a button) is amazing. It's like the iPhone except with the addition of a button. Which is perfect. Be nice if the iPhone could get this feature some how. The gesture support is spot on. It's the first time I've ever used a touchpad and NOT wanted to get a mouse instantly. You can really use it all day and it's transparent. It operates so smoothly. FINALLY.The sound from the speakers is much improved. iTunes in the background or jamming out loud is very clear and full sounding for a laptop speaker. Nothing sounds harsh or crushed. They are laptop speakers mind you, but for that, they are the best I've heard.The display is very clear and off angle is nice. I find the contrast to be pretty good and the 3D performance to be awesome. (and should be with a 9600). The auto switching to the slower power saving 9400 is a pretty neat trick too. I play World of Warcraft and EVE-Online and they both run quite smoothly. When running on battery there is a performance hit with the cycled down cpu and slower 9400, but you'd expect that. I also tried Team Fortress 2 via \"Crossover for Games\" and it ran very smoothly. With only a couple of small display glitches.My only real complaint is the lack of USB ports, it has two. I really wish it had TWO more. My model has the express slot instead of the mini card slot. I find you have many more expansion options with the express slot. Including putting in your own mini card reader. So why limit your options?Finally, Amazon's price was $200 cheaper than Apple's. I got no tax and free 2 day shipping on top of that, pretty sweet.","Date":"September 29, 2009"}

{"Title":"The Best Computer I Ever Owned","Author":"Chris Damon \"Classic TV & Tech Guy\"","ReviewID":"R29T0CUELIHAE0","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this computer for about 6 months now, and I love my MacBook Pro. At home I have a Logitech wireless external keyboard and mouse, a Western Digital Firewire 800 external drive, and a 22\" HP Flat Widescreen Monitor, so it is almost like having a desktop only cooler. I am a dual OS user (Windows/Mac) and I also have both OS on my Mac. Mac OS is by far the superior operating system. But, this computer runs Windows XP and Windows 7 (beta) fast. That's the good thing about a Mac, you can natively run Windows without emulation software, so there is nothing sucking up the processor power! Of course you can use VM Ware or Parallels if you want to run WIndows while running Mac OS which is also cool, but just not as fast. So, for all the people who cry about how expensive the Mac is, IT IS TWO COMPUTERS IN ONE, a Windows machine, a Mac, and  if you want to run Linux that too. Everything runs flawlessly in windows as long as it is either USB or firewire. I also upgraded my wireless router to an \"N\" device, and let me tell you, the router is in my basement and I am two flights up. I get a faster connection than with my ethernet cable plugged in (running 100 Mbps). My next upgrade will be an Time Capsule, though part of my external drive is partitioned for Time Machine, which works quietly on its own in the background.When I go out with my MacBook Pro I never had any problem connecting to Public WiFi networks. The computer simply finds what's available and asks you if you want to connect, it's easier than Windows wireless connections. I also must admit, that when going places, this is the machine you want to be seen with, it is just attractive. So far I haven't seen anyone else with this machine at the places I bring it, I see mostly older MacBook Pros, but the \"Black\" keys give away that you have the newer model, not to mention the slim aluminum case. The keys are lit from behind for dark locations, shut off in bright locations to save battery, and dim accordingly as the light changes. There is also manual control, but the automatic works fine. Same with the screen brightness. It adjusts automatically according to the lighting of the environment you are currently in. There is also manual adjustment, but I never touch it. It also dims during periods of inactivity to save battery power. The screen itself is just awesome, the best laptop screen out there. I am a fan of glossy screens, to me it just makes the picture more vibrant, so those who like the matte screen might be disappointed, since this model does not that.The NVidia Graphics in this machine is top notch too, I use this laptop for video, and with the high graphics turned on, this laptop does a great job. A quick note though, if you are on battery power you will definitely want to just use the integrated graphics mode, since this will almost double the runtime. You will also want to turn off the bluetooth radio, since this also eats up a lot of juice. It's best to bring the power adapter if you plan on doing video or picture editing or heavy bluetoothing.When I go out, I use the trackpad, and leave the mouse at home. You get use to the pad quickly, including the gestures and lack of any buttons, it is quite intuitive. You just have to remember that the button is towards the bottom.The only thing that is a \"con\" for me is that the DVD writer is only 8X and not 16X, but that is just a minor inconvenience.","Date":"June 2, 2009"}

The MacBook Pro is all brighter, sharper, and more beautiful. The screen opens with just a slight touch and the picture is all there in all colors. The screen is like an endless pool - no sharp edges, filled with light and color.The display was very important to me and that is why I chose this over the other models. Side by side, the pictures are like night and day. There is no comparison.One of the most interesting changes is how intuitive and insightful the new trackpad is. This trackpad allows a variety of new moves, including using two fingers or more at a time - even for scrolling.Light up keyboard. Never even knew I needed it though it probably won't be convenient outside.This computer is bigger and faster, as fast as a computer could be. I always wonder why a computer would need to go any faster but the next one always does. Do we get faster? Or does the endless quest for more speed just make us think we do?Concerns:There is a fragility to this that I don't remember ever noticing with my PowerBook. My PowerBook has traveled in backpacks and briefcases and may even have been thrown in a purse from time to time. (Much worse has happened to it.) I even fell off an icy ledge once, with it in my backpack, and it survived. Cats have slept on the PowerBook, open and closed. Drinks have been spilled. The Powerbook is like a workhorse whereas the MacBook Pro seems a little too delicate to throw in a backpack.This is my third Macintosh and the best so far. I was reluctant to leave behind my PowerBookG4 as it moves onto the boat for a second life as a navigator. Luckily I'll still have weekend privileges.","Date":"May 28, 2009"}

I recently installed Windows XP Professional under Bootcamp and it went really smoothly; I still need Windows for some proprietary software I use, and for some mild gaming.  For instance, I picked up Oblivion - GOTY Edition for $20 and thought I'd give it a good run on the Macbook Pro.I haven't had a chance to run any heavy-hitter games yet, but Oblivion runs beautifully at the full 1440x900 w/ 4x AA and Very High Quality settings.  I'm averaging anywhere from 25fps-60fps, depending on the number of sprites; forests (35-40fps), oblivion (40-42fps), town squares (50fps), water and swimming (30-40fps).  The lowest I've seen is 25fps but haven't been able to replicate it; I'm thinking it was Windows running a background process I missed or forget to turn off.  In any case, it runs beautifully.I've really come to appreciate the extra screen real estate, and the display quality of the MBP.  We own a mid-2008 20\" iMac 2.66Ghz and the screen is every bit as good of quality; I really feel like the Macbook Pro is like a \"portable iMac\" in terms of speed and display quality.  It's that good!Lastly, I had a chance to pick up Apple's DisplayPort -> VGA adapter since I will need to hook this notebook up to a LCD projector more than a few times next semester.  The dongle is not cheap but does what it says it will without any fuss.  To test it, I hooked it up to my 42\" 1080i HDTV and it looked beautiful, no interference or pixelation.Two weeks later, this little guy is still working every bit as good as the day I bought it.  :-)--For the past few weeks, I've been shopping for a new notebook computer.  I've owned/used Mac in the past, but am comfortable in both worlds; I prefer Mac, but can get along fine in Windows too.I inevitably ended up with the 15\" Macbook Pro 2.66Ghz because of the sheer size, weight, and performance.  After I spent some time actually touching/using all the competing brands, I came to the following conclusion--you truly do get what you pay for.Some would argue that Macs are too expensive and not worth the hefty cost over their Windows/PC counterparts. Moreover, they would also say that you're paying extra for the fancy-shmancy design and chimp-simple ease of use, not to mention feeding into the smugness of the Mac community.However, my wife and I have owned Macs for the last few years, and I've had a really good experience owning Apple computers.One thing I noticed immediately is the build quality; it's amazing, and very well made.  When you pick up the computer, it feels very rigid and sturdy; it really does feel like a solid piece of equipment compared to other notebooks.The fans are very quiet and the unit seems to regulate heat/temperature very well.  When I turn it on, the Macbook 'bonggggg' sound is the only thing I hear, and cannot hear the hard drive at all.  It's probably the quietest computer I've ever owned.I've not owned this unit long enough (less than 36hrs) to give a more detailed example, but I'm very delighted with the performance in iMovie and iPhoto '09.

However the new battery is about to go, barely a year old, as well and I use the laptop almost exclusively as a desktop :S Then just May this year HP added this laptop to the battery recall program. Link to the HP battery recall form: [...] Apparently the batteries were deemed unsafe by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.Second, a while back there was a huge recall on HP and Dell laptops that used this nVidia chipset. Apparently nVidia used some sort of crappy material in their 86x series GPUs which made them burn out due to high temperatures. You can read all about it here: [...] During that time this laptop (dv9500) was not under the recall and after just 2 months over the 1year standard warranty that my laptop came with my video chip died. HP offered various ridiculous solutions for users on their message boards such as under-clocking the GPU and getting better ventilation for your laptop. I called several times to get this repaired for free but since my warranty was out I initially got refused the free repair. HP denied that the chip was affected which was clearly not true. After demanding to speak to the CEO of HP I finally got through to a case manager of some sorts who got me an extended warranty ($[...] around) which would be cover the repair as if it was under the warranty in the first place (which is another story - I tried to get an extended warranty while going overseas and was refused because apparently they don't cover repair overseas but only give phone support - which later turned out to be not true since I got covered although I had to pay the shipping). Unfortunately I live overseas and had to pay around $[...] extra to get it shipped there and back, but that is way less than what would cost for a new motherboard and installation. Of course I got the exact same brand of GPU chip back so there is no telling when it will die again.","Date":"August 7, 2010"}

The docking station that i bought that connects to the expansion port (which was awesome) broke, the included cd rom drive broke, the tiny remote to control media that comes with this thing broke, the tv tuner i added to cart to fill the purchase price broke, the powersupply it came with broke, the power supply i bought that could do auto and air broke, and even the hard drive it comes with started \"clicking\".So, my advice to future HP buyers, beware, HP isn't a good brand! I was \"lucky\" i shilled out another 300 for the extended warranty, but many people didn't and lost. My friend's 1 yr + few months HP laptop failed, prob mobo issues, so BEWARE!back to the laptop itself.The Bad: it overheats, frequently will do cursor jumping (cursor jumps to lower part of screen, prob due to touch screen capabilities and poor construction), will fail, WILL FAIL, only does s-video out and vga out, and oh yeah the paint on top of the touchpad and left click are fading, (it's black plastic under.)BTW, the video card isn't able to play any good games, its much more of a basic video card, don't buy this for gaming!And, if you're like me and enticed by the price and design, then...The good: touch screen, digitizer pen (use the pen like a mouse), decent to good sound, IR receivers on lower left screen and infront of touch pad (very cool when using remote), expansion port (very good accessory), two audio out jacks, and... screen is approx size of letter sized paper?btw, incase you're still wondering why not to buy it, i'll list the stuff of the laptop that has failed,mother board, card reader, cd rom drive, hard drive, wifi card, included remote control, and maybe other stuff, but i lost track.mine is three years old, now, to keep it from failing sooner, i'm keeping my laptop extra cooled.

Based on a year of usage, I do not recommend this product.Let me layout the good things about this computer first. The screen quality is very good and shiny (I bought the Slim light-LED display for additional money). The colors are very good. The system does not come with a load of unnecessary software and does not slow the performance.  The keyboard feel and comfort is excellent.However, the hardware integration of this computer is weak.  In less than 8 months, the graphics card was completely dead. The mother board was replaced by Dell.  Worst of all the problems is the audio skipping and stuttering during just about anything, playing DVDs, listening to music (either from the harddrive or from an external harddrive), or just working.  If you search the web for XPS M1330 audio skipping, you'll notice that many other individuals have the same problem.  There is a resource conflict between the sound card and the other components of the computer.  Dell is aware of this, yet, they still ship out the computers with this problem.  Apparently, the Sigmatel, the sound card for Dell, and its drivers are responsible for this. Even if you remove the Sigmatel drivers, you'll hear the audio skipping.  My motherboard was replaced second time after consistent errors by the sound card. Still, I hear the audio skipping. I tried all the temporary workarounds that were suggested by many people in forums. But to no avail.In sum, I do not recommend this product. This is one of the premium lines of Dell products.  It is supposed to be highest quality, because it is the highest in price. Yet, the hardware integration is sloppy and poor in quality. I personally regret going with Dell. Next time, I will seriously consider other options, such as HP, ASUS, Apple, etc.","Date":"March 22, 2009"}

Swartzentruber","ReviewID":"R1Q3K2GE3CXCCS","Overall":"bad","Content":"These dell laptops seems to have really bad hardware integration.  Purchase at your own peril.  This is my 4th or 5th laptops in the last few years, and by far the worst.  I purchased the dell thinking it would be relatively decent, but I guess I missed all the posts of touchpad issues that should have served as a serious warning.In short, the touchpad integration in these dell laptops are awful.  Less than 90 days after purchasing this laptop, I started having issues with the touchpad being frozen resuming from standby.  I'm relatively computer savvy, but nothing seems to fix it -- I've replaced drivers, done a system restore to an earlier point, and done a full reinstall of vista, at a cost of close to a day.  You can also find stories of people having dell replace motherboards, trackpad hardware, etc., and still can't get to the root of the issue.  It's pretty scary.  Just search on dell touchpad problems for more details on the variety of issues.  I've also had problems with the DVD \"disappearing\", requiring a reboot to see the drive again.  Dell has a community forum for issues, but it is worthless -- there are many more unsolved issues than solved ones.Overall, this is a very nice laptop, but with all the random hardware/device bugs, it is not my idea of a functional piece of hardware.  I wish that I had read more negative reviews myself before purchasing, so maybe this advice will help others.  Unless dell releases new drivers/BIOS, etc soon, it will be the last dell I ever buy.","Date":"March 29, 2009"}

RAM;  with NVidia video card.So the speed is pretty much equal also.I put 4 Gb RAM into both, and the performance difference is negligible.  Don't waste your money:  2 Gb is plenty.The 9-cell battery of the 1330 is bulky and ugly, compared to the 9-cell of the M1210.by the way, about batteries:  that 9-cell from my M1210 is just about shot, even though the laptop was hardly ever run from only this battery.  When using the 1210 mobile, I used the 6-cell almost exclusively;  only using the 9-cell when the laptop was running on AC power.  Why would that wear out a battery?The 6-cell from the M1210 is still fine, having been used about 5 hours a week for 18 months.I liked the rotating camera of the 1210; the 1330 camera is fixed.The 1330 has better heat dissipation: there's a copper tubing setup that winds its way around heat-producing sources and wicks it over to the fan area;  new in this latest design.I hate the multi-media touch controls of the 1330 as compared to regular buttons (cooly lit-up blue) that you push & click to use, on the 1210.I don't like the fact that screen on the 1330 doesn't tilt back further than about 120 degrees,  as opposed to the 1210 tilting back all the way, flat to 180 degrees.the 1330 has HDMI port which the 1210 didn't,  but it only has 2 USB ports compared to the 1210's four.The HDD of the 1330 is more difficult to get at and swap out than the HDD of the 1210.The 1330 could have been made even a bit smaller, because there's a wide wasted-space frame bordering the screen,  but that would have meant making the keyboard the same size as the 1210.  Fine with me, but maybe users with big fat hands complained about not enough keyboard room.Overall a nice laptop.  I especially appreciate the MedeaDirect setup that both of these laptops have: a very nice & useful touch.This is my sixth Dell laptop and because of their excellent warranty service and great customer care support (especially XPS support)  I can't see myself buying anything else.","Date":"April 10, 2008"}

I've since purchased an Asus which (after a month and a half of usage) works beautifully.My one-year warranty expired a week ago, and I literally think my xps m1330 will die on me at any minute.Pros:lightweight, portable; easy to carry.Cons:everything else. It overheats so bad you could fry an egg on it. Literally--even the plastic keys get hot.Where do I begin?? The laptop broke on the first night I used it; I had just turned it on and started using the internet when it turned off and wouldn't reboot. A technician came out but said the problem was unfixable, so it had to be replaced. A couple months later, the new laptop they had sent (which was supposed to be exactly the same, but was obviously different) died on me--the night before a midterm (I had all my notes saved on it). The screen turned white and made a loud series of beeping noises. Once again, a technician came out, but was able to fix the computer.Maybe half a year later, the charger overheated so badly that it died--this happened days before my new school semester. Once again, I had to contact dell's customer service to send a replacement; though the shipping was fast, it would have been better if the product hadn't malfunctioned to begin with. For a period of time the webcam malfunctioned--I had to contact customer service twice about it. For some reason, flash malfunctions on my computer (I reinstalled it multiple times, but to no avail). The wifi detector is a piece of junk--my roommate (who has a cheaper laptop) always gets internet at our apartment, whereas mine disappears and grows faint. I could go on and on with the problems. The one thing that confuses me is that laptops with worse specs function much better/faster than mine--you'd think with 8 GB of RAM, I could at least open photoshop without it freezing.I've had this laptop for a year and a week and it took more than 5 minutes to open the 'control panel'. That and, within a couple minutes of use, it overheats. Any moment I'm not using it I ahve to turn it off.Don't let my horror story be yours. Spend a little more on a durable laptop that will actually last more than a year. And a note to Dell: if you made your products more durable, I wouldn't have had to contact customer service so often, or have to get everything replaced.Oh, and..

I was wrong.  The motherboard crashed on me after 8 months of owning the thing.  I got the new motherboard but Dell wants to charge me 119.00 to replace the motherboard with MY new one.  You'd think that the computer would last a heck of a lot longer than 8 months but i guess not.  I will continue to use this laptop and save up for a new one.  But if this problem happens again, you can kiss this laptop down the drain.  Dell didn't think this laptop out very well.","Date":"November 6, 2009"}
{"Title":"The Dell that made me a Mac lover.","Author":"Briana L. Mcginnis","ReviewID":"R21WJKXWRUHK84","Overall":"bad","Content":"I decided to buy my notebook with the idea that I would spend a little more on one good, reliable computer that would get me through graduate school.Instead, I bought the Dell M1330.I've had it for about a year and half, during which it has been out of commission or only partially functioning for about six months (usually when I most needed it for writing papers).  I am currently shopping for a Mac, despite my long history of owning dependable Dells.First, it runs alarmingly hot beneath the mousepad.  Second, I have gone through 3 video cards, which are evidently soldered to the motherboard, making for a major repair each time the new one fails. This was not quite as infuriating when the computer remained under warranty, but when it expired (after 2 major repairs in the first year I owned it), I was compelled to pay several hundred dollars to extend the warranty to cover the inevitable future motherboard replacements.The M1330 is a cool, sleek, and lightweight notebook, but you simply cannot count on this computer working properly when you need it to do so.  Don't waste your money -- for a comparable price you can get a nice, reliable Mac.","Date":"February 28, 2009"}
{"Title":"Even worse after repairs","Author":"What Ever","ReviewID":"RKAVPSLEKNFCU","Overall":"bad","Content":"After my last review and the motherboard got replaced for the 3rd time it has gotten worse. Once again I had to go through all my settings and reinstall all the programs that I lost. Along with this is iTunes and setting up all my play lists. This takes a lot of my time and Dell just doesn't get this. I just called back because the last tech messed up the built in microphone and bluetooth. So they want to reinstall the OS to try and fix this. They ask if I have important files on my computer. Why should I have files on my computer? This is crazy. They don't care a lick for your time and effort you put into the junk that they sell you. The support might as well not be there. He warned me that my warranty will expire by January. I don't expect this piece of junk to last that long and don't care. I'm going back to Sony. Never should have left in the first place.","Date":"May 9, 2009"}
{"Title":"Runs Well Between Repairs","Author":"James T. Chapman \"chapjim\"","ReviewID":"R2X2G75WQYNJEV","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this XPS M1330 in November 2007.  Fortunately, it had a three year on-site repair warranty.  The local repair guy got to know my receptionist pretty well for all the times he fixed this thing.  It's either five LCD displays and four motherboards or four LCD displays and three motherboards, all under warranty.  I replaced the LCD display once myself.Now, the 65W AC adapter is not recognized by the computer and doesn't charge the battery, although a 90W after-market adapter works just fine.  Pradeep, the Dell tech service rep, says the motherboard is at fault.  I'm not sure it's worth the cost or trouble to replace the motherboard since the MTBF has been less than a year.Except for having replaced most everything except the keyboard and hard drive, I really like the computer.  It's the ideal size and weight for what I use it.  It looks good, I like the keyboard and display and it connects quickly to WiFi networks.  It does run a little warm.Too bad it's not reliable.","Date":"April 2, 2011"}

{"Title":"Dell should be ashamed","Author":"C. Winton \"cwinton\"","ReviewID":"R1FENBQGETBUZ0","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've been trying to live with this machine for two years now and hate it.  It was a replacement for a Dell 700m which for its time was of a very superior design and was reliable in every respect.  In no way is this a worthy successor.  It runs hot, has a short battery time (2 hours if you are lucky), and basically just isn't reliable.  I can't count how many times it has blue screened on me (Vista Ultimate), reflecting very poor marriage between computer and OS.  Until 6 months ago, when MS released some patches, I couldn't even install software updates.  The fingerprint reader is a joke and the screen has picked up keyboard impressions even though I am quite careful about how I handle it.  Dell replaced the heat pipe to try to cool it down, but that only helped the CPU run cooler, not the overall machine.  I've taken to simply shutting it down rather than using hibernate since half the time if restarts in the case and fries things.I bought this as a long term, serious travel machine, paying a premium price for what I assumed would be superior hardware.  End result ... I feel that Dell ripped me off and will never buy another lap top from them (this was my fourth, so ta ta and good luck).  I'm currently considering purchase of an ASUS U35JC-A1 which with the same screen size is lighter, thinner, more powerful, and has a much longer battery life, all at less than half the price.  I'm sure Dell would claim their hardware has superior construction quality, but from my experience I seriously doubt it.  The company should be ashamed of itself.  Dell's management appears to be operating under the same philosophy that wrecked the American automobile industry, cutting corners to inflate short term profits.  I would like to know the inside story of how this once fine company has sunk so low.","Date":"November 14, 2010"}

{"Title":"Beware - common main motherboard/display defect","Author":"MaxVideo \"maxvideo\"","ReviewID":"R2QW1Y49V2MCHS","Overall":"bad","Content":"First, I love Macs, and when this iBook G3 800 works, it's a fine machine.BUT... this series of G3 iBooks suffers from a very common and notorious soldering defect on the motherboard that affects about 90% of the systems.In fact, for 3 years after they were made, Apple was replacing them for free because the problem was so rampant, but that offer is long expired.Symptoms?  The system won't boot, or will boot and immediately freeze, or will freeze after a few minutes.  Many times, the machine will boot, but the display will be all black, all white, covered in stripes, or any of a zillion other display problems.  Some people \"live with\" the problem byactually clamping a C clamp onto the case in just the right spot to putpressure on the chip inside, which keeps it in contact with the board.Some people open the case and wedge pieces of paper on top of the chip, so that when the case is closed, they press on the chip to keep all the pins in contact.  But this is pretty dicey.The problem was faulty soldering on a ball grid array (BGA) chip on the motherboard.  In my case, I knew this going in, and sent the machine out toa repair services that specializes in this repair.  They disassemble the machine, and re-solder the BGA.  It's been trouble-free for 2 years and still going strong since I had that repair done.Search the web for \"iBook G3 BGA defect\"  and you'll find all you need to know about this issue.  You can find many places that can fix this for $50 - $75, plus shipping.  Just expect to have to do this, and build that into your total cost if you buy one of these.ALSO - these machines are now far too slow to play YouTube videos (or most on-line video of any kind).  Just be aware of that, if that is important to you.  When I bought it 2 years ago, it played YouTube fine, but YouTube and most on-line video continues to get more and more processor-intensive, so now a processor this slow cannot handle it.","Date":"July 26, 2010"}

My daughter can not go on any website unless I have created a shortcut button for it in her favorites bar.  I was able to decide what applications she is allowed to use and I set up network sharing between my computer and hers.It doesn't have the latest and greatest of everything on it but for my 10 year old it has everything she could ever want.  She will probably use this as her primary computer for the next 5 years and at less than $200, that makes it an awesome investment.Plus, with it being a Mac, it will continue to last as an extra laptop for my family forever!

I've taken it apart and depending onprice, I might replace it. I own a Toshiba Satelite and another HP dv6 series bought almost two years ago.In total, I have owned three HP laptops.To make laptops more affordable some parts are made with plastic or other materials which degrade when hot.NO laptop fan will cool it efficiently and require laptop users to need a good laptop fan/cooler. There are waysto circumvent the shortcomings in manufacturing when computer companies do this. I replaced the power jack/porton the Toshiba with a sturdier model which cost $2.99 and about 2 hours labor myself.NO DUCT TAPE INVOLVED.It sucks that many people have had bad experiences with HP.

I use it as a dvr too. The battery is my only real issue it only holds charge for about an hour or so now so I think I will buy a new battery soon. these laptops do overheat if you dont use a cooling fan underneath them the bottom of the machine just dosent have enough space to circulate any air under its huge baseplate so prolonged use is limited to about an hour if you dont provide a usb cooling device underneath it. once you address that issue it will run true and cool without a hitch. I can only guess that a lot of people have let their laptops fry themselves out rather than spend the 20 dollars on a cooling pad.

{"Title":"Tired of HP overheating","Author":"Joshua J. Danziger","ReviewID":"R2U7KA8XCDB02H","Overall":"bad","Content":"Ok, this computer has possessed little to no problems until about 6 months ago. It was purchased in 2008 so it is 4 years old, but I have a Sony Vaio that I purchased back in 2004 which is still being used and works fine, just a little slow compared to today's computers.A minor problem was that the DVD rom drive physically broke, the spinner that holds onto the cd broke off. So guess what, it became useless. After spending more money then I should have for another one, the monitor stopped working. And even when plugging in an external monitor it still did not work. But I could hear the sound of it turning on and making the Window's entrance theme music. So I know the computer is working, just not the graphics card.When looking inside, hp used a small piece of copper to cool BOTH the graphics card and the processor. And guess what, there wasn't even any thermal paste to help with the heat. Wow, HP got so lazy when it came to designing this smartly. The fan was clogged with gunk too. But that happens to any computer.For the cost of the newer HP products, you can find a much more reliable computer for the same price. Read reviews, don't base your purchases off the past. Things change, and HP changed for the worse. I also have overheating problems with the graphics card and processor with their slimelines too.

{"Title":"Totally Love it!","Author":"Tell the Truth","ReviewID":"RN9W367FPDG1E","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this laptop a few years ago and it was absoulutely awesome!  It was listed with Dell as a gaming computer and it was good for games as well as all of the work related things I needed to do.  Just under 5 pounds it was pretty easy to tote around when i was on work related trips.  This model is the last XPS that Dell made with a 12.1 screen.  The dementions of this laptop is a nice \"in-between\" size: it is a bit bigger than a netbook but also a bit smaller than a laptop with a 13\" screen.This baby has 4 USB ports and that is a bit difficult to find these days. You never think you are going to need all those USB ports until it happens!  The hard drive is upgradable to a 500GB if you want to go that high (I upgraded mine to a 320GB and it worked fine. Everyone that saw it loved it! I even had offers to purchase it but I always  refused!Also, not only is it nearly impossible to find a laptop with this size screen, number of USB ports but to have all of this AND it's Core 2 Duo AND it has a  CD/DVD+RW drive is a dream come true. The only problem that I had was that the regular battery only lasted two years so I had to buy another one.  If that is the only issue with a laptop, I think it's worth it.So if you want something small, but not to small and you want it to have the capacity to handle all the bells and whistles you may later want to add, this is a perfect choice!","Date":"March 19, 2011"}

{"Title":"WOW Best laptop your money can buy.","Author":"Jaewoo Kim \"OB-Wan\"","ReviewID":"R3PK9WSX3ITRS3","Overall":"good","Content":"I own the latest 2.8Ghz MacBook Pro with 512MB of VRAM, 4gb 1024mhz RAM, new polymer battery,  and optional 7200 RPM 500GB drive.  I am using both Mac OS and Vista Premium using Bootcamp. I have used my MacBook Pro for a month.Compared to my previous laptop (Dell XPS 1530: 2.0 Ghz, 2GB RAM, 256MB 8600GT VRAM), which was a very good laptop, the MacBook Pro is  stunningly awesome.  The MacBook Pro is far smaller and portable yet performs at MUCH higher level than my Dell ever did.LOOKSIf the MacBook Pro was a woman, it would be Miss Universe. It is thin, light, and as portable as 15.4 inch laptop can be.  Its aluminum casing is not only pleasing to the eye, but also pleasing to the touch as well. There is no cheap plastic anywhere to be found.PERFORMANCEVista Performance Index rates my MacBook Pro at 5.5 (5 is considered very good). The only reason why it is not higher is because the Nvidia 512MB 9600 is not awesome (but still very good) in 3D graphics performance. It is worth noting the 9600 laptop graphics card still performs better in 3D graphics than majority of desktop graphics cards of today.From a usability perspective, this laptop is blazing fast. There is no noticeable lag between CPU and Memory as I have seen with my Dell XPS 1530 laptop (Dell is undermining the performance of its laptops by using cheaper and subpar memory chips). The BUS on this system is also top notch as well.When I play BioShock on Vista, the graphics looks very crisp and the overall responsiveness is very good.Bottom line: you will not be disappointed with the performance of this laptop unless you are comparing it to that of a high end desktop. Certainly, you will be hard pressed to find any medium size 15.4 inch laptop that can even duplicate MacBook Pro's overall performance.TOUCHPAD and SOUNDThe new touchpad is the mouse reinvented. The new touchpad is so good, this is the ONLY laptop which I do not carry a separate portable mouse.  The new touchpad is large, responsive, and just has that WOW factor to it. THE NEW TOUCHPAD, BY ITSELF, IS A GOOD REASON TO GET A MACBOOK.On Vista, the touchpad works almost as well as it does on Mac OS. The only feature missing in Vista is the ability to twist pictures and other objects (not all apps in Mac OS support this feature either).The sound quality is good, but not terrific. On Vista, the MacBook produces maybe 60% of maximum volume it can produce on Mac OS. I have tried reinstalling drivers on Vista but to no avail. I wish MS or Apple will fix this problem (I am sure this is a driver, and not a hardware, issue).PORTABILITY, BATTERY, and HEATBecause of its small form factor and solid all aluminum body, the MacBook Pro is eminently portable. I have had many of laptops (about 8) both for work and for personal use, and this laptop is BY FAR the most portable of all.The battery lasts around 7 hours when I run the Mac OS (9600 graphics card turned off). The battery lasts 4 hours when I run the Vista Home Premium edition (9600 graphics card turn on because it can't be turned off in Vista). My main concern, however, with running Vista on this laptop is not with the battery life but with excess heat output.This laptop is flat and the hottest portion of this laptop is concentrated in the rear bottom. When placed on a flat surface, much of the heat is trapped underneath. The MacBook Pro can overheat to a point where it is uncomfortable to touch the upper surface near the keyboard.  The heat isn't much of a problem with Mac OS, but with Vista, the user must be careful. I strongly advice using MacBook on a open bottom surface, such as laptop stand with an open bottom surface area for ventilation, when using Vista.  You laptop will last longer.Mac OS vs VISTAI was pleasantly surprised that Mac OS can now run Flash and Adobe Acrobat Reader. The compatibility between Mac and PC is closer than ever. MS Entourage (part of Mac Office 2008) is compatible with MS Exchange email, calendar, and contacts. Overall, I am impressed with the Mac OS Leopard. But its achilles heel is still software availability. Although Apple has greatly expanded its library of available Mac compatible software, most softwares, particularly video games,  still do not run on Mac. For Vista, and its successor Windows 7, to better compete against the Mac OS in the laptop market space, it needs to greatly enhance its battery life and substantially lower its heat output.FLAWSI have only two gripes1)Vista cannot utilize the full range of sound the MacBook hardware is capable. Notably, the maximum volume is too low. This can be easily fixed by Apple by updating the sound driver in BootCamp (HINT).2)The Caps Lock button is extremely easy to press. So easy, I wish I could find a way to disable the key.","Date":"July 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"A great, but expensive machine.","Author":"Jon R","ReviewID":"R3LDSGWN561WBV","Overall":"good","Content":"When looking over reviews for Macs, you tend to run into the Apple fanatics. These people will praise anything that Apple makes, regardless of whether its worth the price or not. Having owned and used both PCs and Macs, I have no allegiance to either. I'm going to try to make this as unbiased as possible.Whether you should go with a Mac or PC largely depends on what you'll use it for. These days Mac ARE PCs under the hood, they just use Apple's BIOS (EFI) and of course OS X. OS X is hands down a superior OS to Windows, however there are many applications that won't work under it. Sure you can boot Windows on Mac now, but why would you pay the premium to use Apple's proprietary hardware if your going to use Windows anyway? If your going to get a Mac make sure most of your applications will run on it. Otherwise the Macbook becomes an overpriced PC.That said this is a review of the Mackbook Pro, so here are the pros and cons of it. Its a bit long, but I tried to point out everything.PROS- Beautiful, bright screen- Backlit keyboard- Glass cover LCD, so you can wash it without worring about damaging the LCD.- Fast DDR3 memory- An integrated graohics card to conserve power (GeForce 9400) and a decent graphics card (Nvidia 9600 GT) to use for gaming and graphic intense programs.- Slot-load DVD drive, you don't have to worry about the tray.- Firewire, a feature missing from the regular Macbook- Nice large and responsive touchpad.- OS X performs much better than Windows. Almost no crashes/freezes, very hard to get a virus, and faster.- No preloaded bloatware, in fact most of the apps included are quite useful and easily removed if you want the space back.- Decent speakers for a laptop.- I have no benchmarks, but it seems like Vista runs faster on my Macbook even though the hardware is inferior to my other laptop.- The thinnest and lightest 15 inch notebook I've ever encountered. I have no problem lugging it back and forth.CONS- It get HOT under intense use (especially above the number pad).- The DVD drive is slow to burn and read.- Screen resolution should be higher for this price.- Multi-Touch touchpad takes some getting used to.- THE PRICE.- Despite the fact that Nvidia claims its possible to use the 9400 and 9600 in \"hybred SLI\" (using the 9400 to give the 9600 a power boost) Apple has not included the functionality. There are report that it may come with the next release of OS X.- The HDD is realitivly slow at only 5400 RPM. They should have gone with a 7200RPM. On the bright side its possible to upgrade the drive yourself.- The only video output port is a \"Mini Display Port\". There are currently only two screens on the market that natively support this. Therefor you need to purchase a converter to use HDMI, DVI, or VGA.- The glass screen is VERY reflective.- For the most part its not upgradeable. You can add memory or a new HDD and that's it. However, most laptops are either not upgradable or the \"upgrades\" are so expensive that its better to buy a new one instead.- A minor qualm for me, and something common to nearly all Macs is the lack of an HDD access light. This can sometimes be useful. Also common to al Macs is the keyboard and shortcuts. These are different from Windows and take getting use to. For the most part neither is better than the other, its just a matter of learning a new setup.Overall I love my Macbook. Despite its higher price you get a quality machine for your money. Its much more solid than my other laptop, and s far seems more stable. I would say that if you don't game (or use one of the few games that support OS X) go for this. If you've never thought about a Mac before, its really not that hard to get to know it. Its designed for the computer illiterate (According to Apple, I wouldn't go quite that far), so you shouldn't have trouble finding your way around. Despite the good, I still would recommend you stick with the PC if you intend on gaming. Macs are getting there, but they just don't stand up to a gaming PC.","Date":"April 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"To heck with the skeptics, this new Pro is wonderful!","Author":"Macondray J. Steiger","ReviewID":"R2Q04Y88E6D1ME","Overall":"good","Content":"I read all of Amazon and CNet's reviews before buying, both the positive and the negative.  This new Macbook Pro is absolutely wonderful, incorporating many advantages over my first generation Macbook Pro, with no disadvantages that I have been able to find.The new glossy LED backlit screen is excellent, clear and much brighter than it's CCF predecessor.  It also uses less power, which accounts for the Macbook Pro's noticeably longer battery life, in spite of the fact that the Pro's new battery has been slightly downsized.  Great new keyboard, and EXCELLENT trackpad.  Performance is also faster.  Easily accessible HDD.  And, the most obvious benefit is its beautiful new design, which incorporates all of the excellent features of the first generation Macbook Pro, and then improves upon it.  Great job Apple!Perhaps some of the negative comments regarding the new glossy screen and trackpad were made before their new owners had a chance to fully appreciate these new features?Very happy that I took the plunge to a new Macbook Pro, and I highly recommend it to others!","Date":"December 19, 2008"}
{"Title":"Apple's New MacBook Pro: Reviewed","Author":"alxclrsn","ReviewID":"R2QSWN25L359SM","Overall":"good","Content":"Introduction:After keeping millions in what seemed to be perpetual suspense, Apple finally broke the ice, and, in October, released completely redesigned MacBooks and MacBook Pros. I like many Apple users, ordered my MacBook Pro within a week of its release, (October 20th) and, with great anticipation, opened the box on the 30th. Unfortunately for me, upon inspecting the MacBook Pro that I had ordered, I discovered a fair sized chip in the aluminum casing behind the screen, on the bottom right corner. I immediately called Apple to see what they were going to do to rectify the situation. After waiting on hold for about ten minutes, my call was answered by a very nice man, who apologized profusely for any inconvenience. Unfortunately, there was not much he could do, so I was transfered to a product specialist. By this point, you are undoubtedly bored by this story, so let it suffice to say, that after another two weeks I was finally presented with a working MacBook Pro, as well as two red iPod Shuffles as an apology.Apology accepted, Apple. Now, onto my `test' configuration. This exceptional `Book came with a 2.8 gigahertz processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM, two graphics cards: an NVIDIA 9600M with 256 megabytes of shared video RAM, and an NVIDIA 9600GT, with 512 megabytes of dedicated DDR3 video RAM. To top this baby off, it also has a 128 gigabyte solid state drive, to access data at light-speed, with added security. In addition, like every other new MacBook Pro, this one also came with a 15.4 inch widescreen display, backlit keyboard similar to that on the MacBook Air, an iSight camera and microphone, an all aluminum unibody enclosure, and a buttonless, multi-touch trackpad. So, without further ado, lets begin.Screen:I love this screen. First off, it is lit by LED's, which means it is brighter and more efficient than its earlier iterations. It also has `instant on' capabilities, meaning that lights up as soon as you open the lid. Now, nearly everybody's number one gripe with this machine is the glass that is covering the display. While it increases the richness and vibrancy of the colors, and increases the screen's durability, it is also reflective. The reflection can, in direct sunlight, cause an admittedly distractive reflection. This does not especially bother me, though, because you can simply rotate the laptop a few degrees to the left or right to completely counteract this problem. This makes glass an ideal material for a laptop screen, in my opinion, because if the glare gets bad, you can always just rotate the machine. Now the new LED Cinema Display is another story...Unibody:At the release of this product, Apple was keen to stress the design of this product, including its new `unibody' enclosure. So, what's this all about? Well, in a normal laptop, many interior parts must be added to keep the the computer from twisting or torquing. What Apple has done is replace those parts with a single machined piece of aluminum, thus cutting down on weight and increasing durability. Basically, the metal top case that has holes for the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, and power button is the `unibody.' Honestly, the laptop does feel sturdier, but the weight remains the same, at least for the Pro. I really don't think anybody but an engineer is going to seriously consider this a serious feature, though.Keyboard:As I stated in an earlier review of the MacBook Air, this is, hands down, Apple's best keyboard. I like everything about it. I can, though, notice a slight difference in the feeling of this keyboard when compared with the MacBook Air. The keys feel a bit springier... and I like it. The backlighting is very nice, too, and I noticed that it gets brighter than the Air. One should know that the baseline MacBook does not have backlighting, while the higher end MacBook has `dumb' backlighting which lights the keyboard for five seconds after every key strike, rather than relying on an ambient light sensor. Otherwise, the keyboard is the same.TrackpadThe MacBook Pro is sporting an all new trackpad, which is made entirely of glass. Honestly, you can't tell that its glass. It feels exactly the same. Well, except for the lack of buttons, that is. Yeah, it appears that Steve hates buttons so much that he is attempting to remove them from Apple products... one button at a time. I'm pretty sure that `Jony' Ive is in on that too. It's the great Apple conspiracy! In all seriousness, though, the lack of buttons is a little annoying at first, but you soon get used to it. As a replacement, our fruity friends made the entire trackpad click, which is actually a pretty good alternative. As I said earlier, it takes a while, but you get used to it. Also, they made the bottom corners extra clicky to make it feel more like the old trackpad, while making it progressively harder to click the farther up the trackpad you get.Battery:Apple has made it easier than ever to access the battery on its new laptops. No longer do you risk marring your pristine machine's finish with a coin. Now, all that you need to do is push two latches and remove a small cover to obtain access to both the hard drive and battery. Also, the batteries are smaller, which is nice if you are carrying a spare. What is interesting to me, though, is that apple styled it after the original iPhone, with the aluminum and black plastic two tone thing. As far as battery life is concerned, its great, as long as you use the 9600M. Once you switch it to the GT, it starts sucking power like there's no tomorrow. Overall, with normal use, (like web surfing, video chatting, and listing to music) I get about 3.5 to 4 hours of battery life. When I really start using this beast, and yes, it is a beast, (Adobe CS4, Logic Studio, Final Cut) I get a somewhat pathetic 1.5 to 2 hours. Oh, well. Can't have it all, can we?SSD:While the SSD is an added option, I thought it would be a good idea to include it in a the review, because it is a serious option that many consider. First off, for those of you who don't know, an SSD, or solid state drive, is a replacement to the hard drive in your computer. It is basically a giant usb stick which has no moving parts, which means increased durability. To prove it, some Samsung engineers even dropped it from a building and it still worked. A SSD also increases the speed at which your computer accesses, reads, and writes data. Because there are no spinning platters, data is accessed much more quickly. And, as an added bonus, it is impervious to magnets. (To the best of my knowledge. I know what you're thinking, and PLEASE do not try it.)Design:This baby is a cold, hard, stunner. The black keys and trim around the display, coupled with the aluminum body and silver trackpad, are purely sexy. Top that off with a glowing white Apple logo, and ding! ding! ding! We have a winner. For me, its the little things that impress. The perfectly machined speaker holes and the hidden IR receiver and iSight camera really show how the brilliant folks at Apple stressed after every single detail, no matter how small or insignificant. In redesigning their notebook line, Apple showed that they make powerful machines. Not white, plastic toys. The only complaint that I have is that there is not enough difference between the designs of the MacBook, and MacBook Pro. I mean, speaking from a purely design point of view, why shell out a thousand dollars extra for something that looks just like the cheaper version?Performance:Lets start with the facts. On our Xbench tests, our MacBook Pro, as configured, scored a coveted 175. Lets compare this to the previous generation MacBook Pro, with 2 gigabytes of RAM, and a 2.4 gigahertz Core 2 Duo processor. That scored a 50.  Yeah, that's right. In the words of Steve Jobs, \"Its a screamer!\" Also, after throwing pretty much everything Main Stage and CS4 could throw at it, this puppy still didn't break a sweat. As a final test, we put Windows Vista Ultimate 64-Bit on it using boot camp. After taking all Windows Vista, the worlds most demanding operating system, had to throw at it, it scored a 5.7 out of 6 on the Vista Experience meter! This thing's unstoppable.Conclusion:After using this exceptional machine for a month, I am proud to report that it is worth every penny. It is truly worth an upgrade to anybody who can afford it. In addition, Apple's initiatives to make this notebook `green' make it even more appealing. This is destined to be a very, very, successful product.Alex Carlson-- The MacTips Podcast","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

The system was solid and the latest one is built more solid as a single unibody enclosure. The design is different than the previous model but the processor speed did not change much. May be that will happen during early 2009. After Apple announced the new model, I sold my Mac to [...] and used that money to buy this one. I did get a good price for the older one from them.Regarding the review about this machine, there are lot of sites which have already done or are doing an extensive reviews.

{"Title":"Impressive size, fast, solid feel, but with a caveat...","Author":"Twiddles42","ReviewID":"R2I9AUUTY6QWD8","Overall":"good","Content":"I do a lot of photography, graphic design, and web design.  I recently bought a 24\" iMac (the $1799 model with the 120GTX discrete video RAM) and am loving it.I had a choice:  Spend $2500 for a Windows license of my Adobe products... or replace my Windows laptop with a Macbook.So I bought this Macbook.  Vista turned me off of Microsoft for good.  System requirements are asinine, which also means higher power requirements to do the same things I can do on the Mac.  I've worked with PCs ever since  Windows 1.0 -- and loathed the registry in Win95.  But I digress...  no more Windows.  I throw an Apple and broke the Windows.  :)I only mention price as a downer because the laptop has only 2GB of RAM and whose display contains a TN panel.  I was hoping for a M-PVA or better.  Still, looking directly at it, color shift is minimal.  Still, my iMac's H-IPS panel monitor blows it away in terms of gamut and shadow detail.  Not that 2GB is _bad_ or anything, but the screen was a disappointment for a $2000 notebook.As usual, OS X rocks.RAM is inexpensive, so to up this to 4GB is no ordeal.And I'll be honest:  This thing is light and has a very solid feel.  A comparable Windows laptop (think $1300) is twice as thick and needs far more than 2GB of RAM to make use of it.  I'd rather have efficiency and quality for a higher price than another piece o' junk to be upgraded all the time.I'll keep major photo editing on the iMac because of its superlative display (no $500 PC monitor even comes close; more TN garbage but larger so the flaws become even more apparent), but this is capable of most design work that doesn't require pinpoint color manipulation.  And there's plenty of that that can be done too.","Date":"May 1, 2009"}

This is simply a stunningly well designed, solid notebook.

For both work (software development) and play (World of Warcraft) this machine suits me just fine.However, if you have an Apple store handy, I recommend you buy there instead. From the first time I turned on the laptop, the dvd drive made a loud noise every time I turned it on or woke it up from sleep. I took it to the nearest Apple Genius bar and they agreed it was wrong, and offered to trade in for a brand new one. Then they found out I bought from Amazon, so they couldn't do that. Instead I had to mail my laptop to AppleCare and wait for them to say there was nothing wrong, and then send it back fixed(!).

{"Title":"Excellent hardware, but sharp corners!","Author":"G. Bartley","ReviewID":"R1WQNFF3LBTBA0","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought one of these the day they were released.  However, every time I would get up from using my laptop for a drink or potty break, my wife would steal it!  She was hooked.  I told her that we had to get a laptop for her so that I could use mine.  We went to Best Buy and test-drove a few cheaper PC/Vista laptops.  None of them even remotely stacked up to the quality of the aluminum unibody MacBook Pro.  She -had- to have a 15.4\" widescreen LCD that could be viewed from sharper angles than sitting directly in front of the screen.  She -had- to have a backlit keyboard.  She -had- to have a glass, button-less touchpad.  That narrowed it down.  She -had- to have a 15\" unibody MacBook Pro.All-in-all, we love just about everything about our laptops.  My only complaint is the sharp edges.  The 90-degree edge where your wrists wrest is uncomfortable for any lengthy coding or writing sessions.  And the notch cut out in the middle below the touchpad has VERY sharp corners.  I have actually nicked myself a couple of times on it.I would actually give this laptop a 4.5 out of 5 because of the edges.  However, Amazon doesn't support half-stars, so I rounded up.Oh, and this laptop made me a \"switcher\".  I bought a Mac Mini as an HTPC a few years ago, but never used it much.  Now, with this laptop, I never touch either of my high-powered Vista gaming rigs.  Sure, gaming on a Mac leaves a lot to be desired, and I haven't had any luck with the virtualization software for gaming (VMware, Parallels), but that's not my primary usage.  I'm a web developer and use an array of applications.  If you're a hardcore PC person, give a Mac a spin.  You'll find you can do anything on a Mac that you can do on PC.  It's a little unfamiliar at first, but it is just so much easier and cleaner-feeling and nearly hassle-free.","Date":"March 4, 2009"}
{"Title":"Macbook Pro = Excellence","Author":"Socrates \"Nick\"","ReviewID":"RB265OQ06N3LT","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought a new Macbook Pro after my old one died (my fault!). I cannot express how much I love this new aluminum (unibody) Macbook pro. The first thing I noticed when I got it was how gorgeous the LED screen was. I mean this is probably the best LCD I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant and black levels are excellent. Yes, there are times when the glossy screen makes it difficult to see, but unless your always in a very bright room, the benefits of the glossy screen make it a much better screen. Its a pleasure watching 720p movies on this laptop. The 2.4 Ghz Core 2 duo is fast and should provide more than adequate processing power for most people. Its only 5.5 pounds and me being a college student,its very easy to carry around. I mainly chose the Macbook pro over the Macbook due to the screen size and a much better LCD screen. Don't be fooled, just because both screens are LED backlit, the panel is completely different. Overall, If you can afford one, pull the trigger and you will love it and have no regrets buying one. Whether its watching HD movies, gaming, or Photoshop CS4, this powerful laptop can handle it all. Oh and its doesnt get too hot like the earlier macbook Pros","Date":"February 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Amazing machine","Author":"Smart Little Magpie","ReviewID":"R11A3T2ESFND8U","Overall":"good","Content":"I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","Date":"December 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"C. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows","Author":"Eagle Vision","ReviewID":"R3L7OKJPVR55VJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!","Date":"December 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"Still a pretty decent computer for some, but a MAJOR downgrade from previous generation.  No longer for creative Professionals","Author":"Nick \"CellGeek\"","ReviewID":"R1YV1AYHEWP7TH","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"So much to say...","Author":"Scott D. Espenschied \"ScoDal\"","ReviewID":"R2VGRT0I45JFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.","Date":"December 14, 2012"}

This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.

Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

{"Title":"My 1st Mac...Love it!","Author":"J. Buck","ReviewID":"R296B1VMD0A6G2","Overall":"good","Content":"After looking and researching for a long time I decided to switch to mac. This review is for the Macbook Pro 2.4 GHz and 2GB RAM. This is my first mac and I have had very little experience with mac before this purchase. I have had this computer for a few weeks now so I feel like I can provide an accurate review.Design: Absolutely beautiful! It seems like they really thought everything out. The magnetic latch and magnetic power cord are genius and very nice features. The computer does seem very sturdy and well built.Screen: I know many complaints are about the screen and it is indeed reflective. HOWEVER, I have yet to have a problem with reflection and the screen is vibrant, I love it.Hinge: I have read complaints on the hinge being too weak. I have not experienced this with mine and would say the resistance is about perfect. I can tip the computer at a very steep angle without the screen falling.Trackpad: This was one feature I was a little concerned about. I did experience a few problems with the trackpad but the update from apple fixed that. I can honestly say this is probably one of the greatest features of the machine. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the gestures and not having a dedicated button. Now, I feel like all other machines should have this trackpad and I really miss it when I am using other machines.Keyboard: This is a personal preference but I love the \"Chicklet\" style keys and it feels great. The backlight is nice to have also.Performance: This machine is fast! I have the Adobe CS4 Design premium loaded on the machine and it handles it with no problem. All other programs open and run amazingly fast. I have yet to have any problems with performance. Also, the machine is very quiet and stays cool. Battery life seems to be fine but I have not really put it to the test.Compatibility: I have yet to experience any compatibility issues. I do have Windows XP running through VMware Fusion 2.0 and it works pretty good (Separate review for this product). All my electronics and printers just worked...sure is nice.Value: So far I am very happy with my purchase. The machine runs great, looks great, and I am happy that I made the switch. I do not miss my PC at all. You will pay a premium for a Mac but it is a premium product. If you want a excellent computer and are thinking about this machine, I would highly recommend purchasing one.I was debating between the Macbook and the Macbook Pro and I am glad I went with the Pro. The extra screen size is very nice to have and the machine is not all that big.","Date":"December 22, 2008"}

{"Title":"15 year PC con-vert to Mac. THIS model MacBook made me do it.","Author":"Kevin Quattro","ReviewID":"RYB98AZ7KNOB6","Overall":"good","Content":"What can I say? Maybe it's my age catching up with me. I am not sure. I know that I was just tired of all the mess there is in keeping a PC up to date and always running. Drivers, inter-application support, all of this is just something PC owners deal with and have gotten use to. I'm tired of it.I found the iLife suite of applications a perfect answer for everything I needed. iPhoto, iMovie and of course iTunes (which I was already using on the PC along with my iPhone) are just a joy to use. iPhotos \"places, faces and events\" are super cool. And it's amazing how easy it is to get photos in and tagged. Everything about OSX just flows easily and never gets in my way. Everything works together smoothly and nothing competes with each other. i.e. WIndows Photo Viewer and Media Player both wanting to manange your pictures and videos DIFFERENTLY. Typical PC reply is \"oh just download this other app and install this service and then run this codec pack and set this registry entry and you're all set'\"  NO...I'M DONE WITH THAT. iLife and OSX WORK.Now to the hardware.I liked the previous generation MacBook Pro. It was missing some things though for the price. For one, it seemed to not really offer much in build and features I couldn't get elsewhere much cheaper in a PC laptop. This was not to say I would buy a PC but it meant I was looking at the MacMini or possibly even the iMac. Something I didn't really want to do. I wanted a laptop. So I waited. Another year with the PC...then finally these new ones hit.I was blown away by the features videos and when I got to handle one in person...WOW. They are thinner yet completely SOLID. Picking one up or just smashing the keys and you feel like you're using something God would use. I can rest my fat palms on the faceplate without worry. The new black backlit keys are MUCH easier to see and feel great! The buttonless touch pad (the entire thing is a button) is amazing. It's like the iPhone except with the addition of a button. Which is perfect. Be nice if the iPhone could get this feature some how. The gesture support is spot on. It's the first time I've ever used a touchpad and NOT wanted to get a mouse instantly. You can really use it all day and it's transparent. It operates so smoothly. FINALLY.The sound from the speakers is much improved. iTunes in the background or jamming out loud is very clear and full sounding for a laptop speaker. Nothing sounds harsh or crushed. They are laptop speakers mind you, but for that, they are the best I've heard.The display is very clear and off angle is nice. I find the contrast to be pretty good and the 3D performance to be awesome. (and should be with a 9600). The auto switching to the slower power saving 9400 is a pretty neat trick too. I play World of Warcraft and EVE-Online and they both run quite smoothly. When running on battery there is a performance hit with the cycled down cpu and slower 9400, but you'd expect that. I also tried Team Fortress 2 via \"Crossover for Games\" and it ran very smoothly. With only a couple of small display glitches.My only real complaint is the lack of USB ports, it has two. I really wish it had TWO more. My model has the express slot instead of the mini card slot. I find you have many more expansion options with the express slot. Including putting in your own mini card reader. So why limit your options?Finally, Amazon's price was $200 cheaper than Apple's. I got no tax and free 2 day shipping on top of that, pretty sweet.","Date":"September 29, 2009"}

It's also super light weight so it doesn't bog me down when I'm carrying all of my work stuff through airport security.  I've had it for about a month now and have not experienced even one single problem.  Transferring my files was a cinch, but it takes a minute to get used to the new operating system.  I watch movies on it, do presentations on it, browse the internet and check my mail.

{"Title":"Perfect mobile workstation for a designer","Author":"Brian Ward","ReviewID":"R3LI4VB70GUI5H","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this to replace my PowerPC G5 tower, but it's much more than a replacement, it's a big upgrade. I'm a web/motion designer, so even for projects at home I need some decent power. A Macbook Pro is pretty much the only way to go.Pros:I love how small it is, but the uni-body design also feels very sturdy. The LED-backlit screen is amazing and surprisingly bright. It's pretty fast using Adobe CS3 programs. I never have any trouble getting a strong connection to wireless networks.Cons:I didn't have an option to configure the laptop. It would have been worthwhile to me to upgrade to a 7200RPM hard drive and more RAM. But the cost savings were so great, I sacrificed these minor upgrades. I can add them later anyway if need be.","Date":"April 30, 2009"}

{"Title":"The PowerBook is back!","Author":"J. mcnalley","ReviewID":"R3QKDLG6UD6STC","Overall":"good","Content":"My last portable mac was a 1GHz Titanium PowerBook - the TiBook. Since then, I've been waiting for a suitable replacement. After a few years of weak aluminum G4 \"PowerBooks\", I switched over to a G5 Tower. A few more years later, I wanted to move back to a portable machine and started looking at the new unibody MBP.1. The new MBP is as fast and quiet as a PowerBook should be. The late G4 machines always seemed underpowered at the Apple Store. The early Intel machines were either too loud or too hot. The MBP is just right.2. Style is back. The previous generation of aluminum machines always struck me as a matte-gray version of the Snow iBook/MacBook design. That design works very nicely in brilliant white and matte black, but felt clunky to me when executed in aluminum. The new unibody design does a great job of mixing a glossy black display with a block of carved aluminum.3. Power too. OSX is Unix and a GUI in one well-integrated system. Everything good about OSX that has been written elsewhere applies here.4. Upgradability. Open the battery cover and you have access to both the HD and the battery. 250GB is plenty for me today, but when I can get a 2.5\" 1TB drive spinning along at 4200 RPM, the upgrade will be easy. All the screws appear to be phillips now, so I won't need my T8 driver anymore.5. Magsafe is a big win. The old power cables were very easily damaged, and easily damaged your mac6. The DVD drive is finally where it belongs - on the side! Actually, I wish I could order a MacBook Pro without an optical drive at all. Who uses optical media anymore?7. The new trackpad is simply great. I was going to order a nice laser mouse to go along with the MBP. After 15 minutes with the new giant trackpad, I don't think I'll ever plug a mouse or external keyboard into this machine. I wish apple made external trackpads for desktop computers.","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

I'm using it mostly for email, web browsing, digital photography, iPod (audio books, music), and remote access to work systems.  Following optional packages are installed: iLife, Office for Mac, VMware Fusion, Windows Vista, and various Windows programs on Vista. The system seems remarkably stable; it stays running for ages without needing to be rebooted.  The transition from Windows to Mac has not been difficult though I miss the Windows keyboard shortcuts for moving around and have yet to learn their counterparts on the Mac.The only real complaints I've got about the MacBook Pro are: 1) it requires a proprietary video cable (Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter) to work with a 30\" external monitor and 2)the display contents (text, images) periodically become blurry/unreadable requiring me to put the system to sleep and wake it up to reset the display.  I'm using a Samsung SyncMaster 30\" display but have seen several reports of other people having the same problem with other 30\" displays including the 30\" Apple Cinema model.  My recommendation is to use a 24\" external display instead.  I understand they work fine with the MacBook Pro.","Date":"February 20, 2009"}

The glossy screen is annoying at times, but when there's no light behind to cause glare, it's spectacular in color and clarity.I'd recommend getting either an 800/400 firewire adapter or a cable with those plugs on either end when you purchase the laptop if you need to move files from another computer, which probably uses 400. The Migration Assistant seemed to insist on using a firewire, so I ended up saving the files to an external hard drive, then copying them to the MacBook via USB cable.

The magnetic latch is genius, and is way better then the manual latch they had on previous gen models. Also i like the black chicklet keys that I'm typing on right now to write this review.The magsafe power adapter is just f@#%ing awesome. Theres no other way to describe it. Also, some people may disagree, but i love the new trackpad, and how its all one button. i couldn'tlive without it. In fact whenever i am on somone elses laptop, i am always wonder why it is not clicking.lol.The glossy screen does not bother me, but then again i am never outside with my laptop, so no comment on that. This laptop definately is sturdy as hell and i wouldnt be surprised if it could take a fall.Software: iLife suite is awesome,i mainly do find myself only using Garageband though since i have Premiere Pro to use instead of iMovie. But it would be awesomefor anybody who has no idea what they are doing.OS: A million times better than any windows OS in my opinion. You dont ned to be scared about making the plunge into MAC OSX. In fact, to prepare, i tried to learn everything i could about MAC OSX before i even got the mac. Overall though it is a very fast OS, and EVEN FASTER with 4GB RAMHardware:Like I said before, this machine is fast as hell. Even when rendering files and editing video this thing holds up. But what i do recommend is that you upgrade your RAM to 4GB if you want extraordinary power, and no hiccups. Again with the video editing, you may aslo want to consider a faster/ bigger hard drive.Thats about all i have to say/ all i can say for now. I hope this helps you decide on your final purchase.

Apple dropped the price on this item by about 400 dollars. I cannot exchange with Amazon, or get a refund, although I'm within the 30 day return period. They want a minimum 15% restock fee. Just got off the phone with a Codie B, supervisor at Amazon customer service. They are absolutely no help, wish I had bought this at my local BEST BUY, where there is price match/guarantee.3. I'm very disappointed that Amazon treats a loyal regular customer this way. Now ex-customer.All rantings and frustration aside, This is a Fantastic Product from Apple. Being a first time Mac user, coming from a predominantly Linux and Windows world, the mac hardware is the tops. Not to mention Leopard, has everything I need. I eventually set up my firewall,( ipfw script with a startup plist in /System dir). As I come from a Unix b/g, I'm comfortable with configuration, a little phone help from apple would have been much appreciated, and deserved, after paying so much.I rate 1 star for my experience with buying this from Amazon.The product itself would rate 5 stars.I had done a lot of research, before buying, and nobody else offers the same top level hardware and OS that will do everything you ask of it.Some of the goodies, out of the box, like, In built VNC(server and client), SMB print/file sharing, Security, and amazing speed. Top that with no extra anti-virus s/w or subscriptions to purchase like some other OSes. I get a battery duration of about 5.5 hours, when I just browse/read. The list goes on, DiskUtility that can resize and partition without destroying data, multi-touch trackpad while reading, very small os memory footprint,  Xcode looks very promising... I found a freeware utility that will \"burn\" Audio-DVD too, along with other formats.Apple has a this approach, of exposing elegant and minimal menus on the outside to users, but as we dig deeper, are rewarded with more and more details. As you delve deeper, more details and options are available.All in all my personal opinion: If you are planning to buy this, look at the new 15inch, 2.8 Ghz configuration, it has the same 6Mb L2 cache, that's touted as the number one reason for performance increase by Intel.

I went through three of these unibody MBP's and wound up opting to just get a full refund. All three I owned, plus the display models in my local store had warped lids meaning, when the notebook was closed there was a noticeable gap between the lid and the bottom of the machine. When you picked up the machine you could actually feel the lid moving down.. This is unacceptable for such an expensive machine from a company that claims to pride itself on quality. One of the machines had a faulty optical drive and two felt as if there was something loose and clunking around inside the casing when I picked them up, even when they were turned off. I was lucky enough not to get one that had a loose battery cover, tons of dead pixels, or slanted keys on the keyboard. These all seem to be common issues with these new mpb's. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of quality control.This is a beautiful machine but, if you have an apple store near you, I'd suggest buying it directly from the store so that if there is a problem you can go right back there and deal with it immediately.","Date":"November 4, 2008"}

I learned that Apple does not consider this to be \"Materially Defective\" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.

OS X is a so so OS, the system runs ok same as any other MAC I guess. I bought an ACER Extenza 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM, 320gb HD w. Vista Home Premium and it's way faster then the macbook pro. At which time I realized that the macbook pro had cost me three times as much for less performance and speed...plus no games and minimal apple only applications/software. For the price macbook pro's should be a hell of alot faster. Plus in a few years....good luck upgrading. The DVD/CD rom drive sucks because unlike my ACER or any PC/laptop it doesen't have the eject button right on the dvd drive, so if your MAC locks up (which it will) there's no way to eject the cd/dvd (yes I tried to keyboard eject button) with the mac locked up it's useless. I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple. No MAC is worth the asking price, they are generally slower than any PC/Windows based Laptop I have ever compared it too and are severly limited compared to windows users. Save your money, buy a high end windows laptop and a PC together for less then what Apple wants for their Macbooks. Next off, as stated this laptop is half as fast as an ACER Extanza or Gateway T-Series with the same specs. The pro gets boiling hot when running simple apps, and even gets so hot it could damn near start a fire, it's hot enough that you can bearly stand to touch it near the battery and under the screen/keyboard. It can't run windows for crap, even with boot camp. I boot camped Windows XP and the mac pro had an extremely hard time running it, taking forever to boot up and shut down, im talking like 10 mins. That goes to show that windows based laptops (PC's) are faster and better. Little heat, top notch speed (totally smoked the macbook pro easily). A mac runs OS X duh good but can't even handle XP......sad. Mac sucks. Overpriced BS.","Date":"January 29, 2009"}

I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback). God loves you.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}

{"Title":"This is a \"Pro\" in every sense.","Author":"J. Shea","ReviewID":"R284YNFG61TCBF","Overall":"good","Content":"In March 2008, I decided it was time to upgrade from a G4-based laptop to one of the new Intel models. I deliberated back and forth whether the lower priced MacBook would be sufficient or whether to pay the premium for the \"Pro\" model. Ultimately, I decided upon the MacBook Pro for these reasons.Construction qualityThe aluminum case of the MacBook Pro reminds me of a product made by the Swiss. The build quality is outstanding for a mass-produced device. It feels very substantial, and all the pieces fit together nearly seamlessly. The MacBook's case, however, is made from a high-grade plastic rather than metal. It's nice ... but I found the front edge of the MacBook's case a bit sharp on my wrists as I typed.PortsCompared with the MacBook, the MacBook Pro provides an additional USB port plus Firewire 800. The latter is desirable for people who work with video and external drives that have Firewire 800 connectors. The ExpressCard slot is useful for future expansion and services such as wireless broadband (EVDO).KeyboardKeyboard experiences are subjective; but I find the keyboard on the MacBook Pro the most comfortable of any laptop I've ever used. It feels solid and responsive. Plus, its backlighting is helpful when typing in dark environments.Dedicated videoUnlike the MacBook that shares system memory for video (integrated graphics), the MacBook Pro has a dedicated video processor. This is beneficial for driving large external displays and running graphics-intensive applications.Is the MacBook Pro worth the $700 price differential over a MacBook? That depends on whether you are a general home computer user (i.e., e-mail, web browsing, iTunes, word processing) or someone who uses their laptop for more advanced purposes. My user profile is more in the second category. Also, since I intend to keep this computer for three years, I figure that the premium breaks down to about $233 each year. This seems reasonable to me for something I use every day.In view of the additional quality and benefits that the MacBook Pro offers, I think its higher price brings with it commensurate value. It's hard to imagine even finicky laptop users being disappointed with the MacBook Pro.P.S. -- There are two 15-inch MacBook Pro models. I bought the 2.4 gHz \"entry level\" model. It is the better value. I do not feel the 2.5 gHz MacBook Pro is worth the extra $500.Also, people who care to add system memory (beyond the stock 2 gigabytes supplied by Apple) ought to purchase it from a third-party vendor and install it themselves. It is a simple process.","Date":"March 12, 2008"}
{"Title":"Finally, the perfect desktop replacement","Author":"Jason","ReviewID":"RAGIRU3TFA2QP","Overall":"good","Content":"Short and Quick ReviewThis model is worth the 500 difference between the entry level.  The screen is beautiful, the new LED Displays are great, better color depth, more color, the laptop doesn't get as hot as previous versions.  Everything works, it is very fast, and this laptop replaced 2 high end workstations + 2 high end laptops (A dell with workstation class graphics card, and 17 inch macbook pro).  I can edit 1080p high def video in real time with no slow down, edit my 12mp raw files in real time with no slow down.  I can play the latest games like Call of Duty 4 maxed out on windows vista at native resolution with no slow down online.With the beefy 250gb HD, ability to upgrade to 4gb of ram, the 512 graphics card, and 6mb cache, this machine is a complete replacement for me, and revolutionizes my life, work style, and workflow.It is worth buying, and definitely better than the 2k version, by leaps, read my longer review for more.Longer Fuller Review.The new macbook pros are fantastic!  I had a 17 inch core 2 duo before,  it was nice, but it didn't do everything I wanted or needed.  I was forced to keep my mac pro, and my custom built windows PC for running the applications I need, and the ability to play games (I do some freelance game design, as well as photography and animation work)I grew tired of having so many workstations, but what can you do when you need the power?  Apples new macbook pro has answered my needs.  I have wanted a laptop with a 512mb graphics card for years, it has never happened until now.Previous to this laptop, my laptops have been \"toys\" the only close workstation I had was a dell that cost close to 3k, and would break your back to carry it (but it had a 512 workstation class graphics card!)With this laptop, I have sold my other machines, it is all I need, or want.  If it meets my needs and expectations, it should be able to meet yours easily.The reason you buy this model, is because of the graphics card, and the increase in l2 cache on the processor.  The 2k model has less cache than last years santa rosa model (3mb compared to last years 4mb) this model and the 17 inch has 6mb, as well as the 512mb graphics card, dual core processor, and the ability to use 4gb of ram.After getting the laptop, I use bootcamp to repartition the harddrive (did not need to reinstall OS X, was able to do this on the fly to install windows)  I split it up to give me 165gb for OS X, and the rest for windows.I need to use specialized software that requires windows, and these programs also require very high end workstations.  The life of someone in 3d is not easy.  This workstation takes care of all my needs.  I'm running the 32 bit version of vista ultimate (the 64 bit is horrible, do not run it)  I use windows to run the programs I need (mainly zbrush, unreal engine, and 3ds max)  I can and do have maya, and can use it on this partition as well as os x thanks to the dongle, but I cannot use my creative suite software on windows, because of adobes licensees.  (though oddly enough, I can run Lightroom on both platforms)On my OS X side, I run maya, photoshop, after effects, and final cut studio (with shake 4.1, yes I need 2 compositing programs)  I have no problems running these programs on this system.  I can render out quickly, everything is snappy.  With the 8600 geforce (opposed to ATI) maya is very responsive, and I get very few render errors.  Dynamics are able to be rendered on this machine, and I can run simulations with ease.  Render times are quite quick, and this system is very responsive.I do photo editing, and this machine is fast as well (I upgraded to 4gb of ram myself for 95 dollars) my camera is a nikon d300,  which is 12mp,  I use lightroom and photoshop extensively, and at the same time with no problems at all.I also run maya and photoshop cs3 together all the time (with itunes in the background).With leopard, I find using this machine even better.  I can use spaces, and have maya on one screen, then I can swtich to another screen with photoshop to paint textures, or reference something, and go to another screen for safari or itunes.The touchpad is cool.  Even in windows, I can right click by using both fingers on the touch pad, and clicking with the bar, very smart apple!  it works in OS X as well (but you have to enable it)I bought the apple keyboard (not the wireless, as I need a full size keyboard) and that keyboard is fantastic, the best I have ever owned.  I love it.  I also bought the logitech g9 mouse to use as my mouse (I cannot stand Mighty Mouse)  this mouse is perfect, and similar price.  With the wired keyboard you get use ports on the side, so you can attach the mouse to the keyboard with no problems.  And it saves on clutter.For those who enjoy playing video games (I do help make them)  you will be happy to know you can play the latest games on PC here with great ease.  I can play call of duty 4, at native res of 1440x900 (on vista) with little to no slowdown.  Same for Unreal 3 (and all games that use this engine).  I can play Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 maxed out all the way, at the native screen res, with no problems at all.  I can play crysis, and bioschock (not maxed out, but pretty close).I have not been so excited about a laptop in ages.  I had the original powerbook and used it all over, but it was slow, it was something to use when on the road, and at school.  When the first macbook pro came out, I was all over it, the software was buggy, it only allowed 2gb of ram, and it was not practical as my only system, nor was it applicable for heavy use by me.  I got the 17 inch when the core 2 duo's came out, it was great, very snappy, and with the 256 card it was close to everything I need (but only 3gb of ram)  I skipped the santa rose, as It did not really address anything.  This model addresses everything.  With 4gb of ram, 2 cores, 6mb of l2 cache, and a 512mb graphics card, there is nothing I cant do.I edit HD video (1920x1080p) in final cut with no problems.  I composite this video in shake with 3d made in maya with NO PROBLEMS.  I play high end PC games maxed out with no problems!  (Call of Duty 4 is a hard game to run, this runs it and I can play it maxed at native res, online, with no slowdown at all).I work on my raw images from my nikon with no problems at all.  This machine is just perfect.  Everything works the way it should, and the way it needs to.The only complaint I have is they did not include remotes in this revision.  You can still access Front Row by using Command ESC and use that to view videos (which look very good on my HDTV).I should also note, if you buy another keyboard (such as the apple external which I highly recommend (the wired, not wireless)  You need to go into system preferences and turn off the optiion for F Keys, as this keyboad has an FN button, like the one on the laptop, and renders using your f keys impossible without pressing fn, turning on that option, makes your keyboard normal, and you can use fn to adjust the volume of your laptop.Right now I have this laptop hooked up to my HDTV using the supplied DVI to VGA cable, and a line out form the laptop.  I have sound on my tv (which I could pipe to a sound system if needed, or (what I do) have it piped to my wireless head phones).  This laptop is where it is at.Please, do not think the 500 dollars for this model over the other is not worth it, as it is very much worth it.  The difference between this model, and the 2k model is night and day for me.  It goes from a toy, I can use when on the plane, to my only computer!  And that is HUGE if you are anything like me.Now the difference between this and the 17 inch does matter.  If you get the 17 inch, you will likly not be playing the latest games at native resolution, and I plan on using this hooked up to my TV, so I do not need 2 extra inches.  If you will only be using the laptop, and have no plans on games, the 17 inch may be better for you.  After reading many reviews, the 15 inch has better response times, and everything is slightly snappier than the 17 inch, which is why I went with the 15.  There is not much a difference in size between the 2, the 17 is not much bigger than the 15, but for me, you could not get me to part with my 15 inch for anything.This laptop is perfect, get it, and enjoy it.  The design will likely change by the next revision (rumored in june / july)  this could be the last time you can get such a beautiful laptop, that works perfectly, and is everything you can want.5 out of 5, no problems at all.","Date":"April 6, 2008"}

This is my first Macbook and I am Impressed with several things. Performance, Build, Style, Sound, Touch pad responsiveness and Overall quality get perfect 10's in my book. However, the reason for the 2 star rating was the quality of the display.Do a little researching on YELLOWING and you will know what I'm talking about. The first MBP I received from amazon had about 2 inches of yellow (stained) pixels at the bottom of the screen. I brought it to the apple store and the guy noticed it and offered a replacement, warning me that if I take the replacement I am risking getting a worse display. He opened a brand new box for me and the display had no yellowing but had BRIGHT SPOTS all over the place. This affected more of the middle of the screen so I went back a second time for my third replacement. This MBP has also disappointed me because it also has YELLOWING on about the bottom third of the screen.Still, I am debating of going back to the Apple store to replace or just simply return this laptop and go with something else. Keep in mind I have owned this for 7 days total. This is a very valid issue and for a $2000 plus investment it is something to consider.This is a known problem since the SR MBP's and I thought they would have fixed it in quality control but no. I will give Apple credit for great quality service, but they should really spend more money on quality control!I have the Macbook Pro 15.4\" 2.4GHz 200GB.The displays affected were the 9C81, 9C81 and 9C83... two had yellowing, one had uneven bright/dark spots.","Date":"April 19, 2008"}

{"Title":"Better value than new unibody MacBook Pro","Author":"Bullminator \"1080P\"","ReviewID":"R1BPM7BPE06CE4","Overall":"good","Content":"Background:I wanted to buy the new unibody MacBook Pro.Tried it at the Apple store and here are my findings and opinions,and comparisons with the March 2008 model (MB134LL/A - the one I bought and am reviewing).Display on unibody model is super glossy and very reflective - and has no option for matte finish.Keyboard on unibody model did not feel as nice as the March 2008 model.Unibody model is slightly larger - bezel width is more than the March 2008 Model.Also, the March 2008 model is a lot cheaper (about $700),and there is an additional $150 rebate from Amazon.Meaningful specs difference:2.5 GHz versus 2.53 GHz CPU in the new high end one,2 Gigs of RAM versus 4 Gigs of faster RAM in the new high end (I upgraded to 4GB myself for $60),8600M GT 512MB versus 9600M GT 512MB in the new high end (20-30% faster),250GB 5400RPM versus 320GB 5400RPM in the new one (more on this below),The new one also has dual graphics (use the lower power one for more battery),but I'd always use the higher one, which would lead to less battery lifethan the March model.Display:Like I said, I prefer matte finish (or a glossy that is not like a mirror).The default colors were a little dull, so I went to System Preferences/Display/Color/Calibrate andtweaked around and saved a new color profile. It is MUCH improved now - much better saturationand has the contrast of glossy without the reflections.Usage:In less than 5 minutes, I upgraded to 4 Gigs RAM - bought that for about $60 from Amazon.I am keeping my two original 1 Gig sticks in case I need them in the future.I have VMWare Fusion running Windows XP Professional for some of mymust-have Windows apps. I have given the VM 1 Gig of RAM and 40 Gigs of disk.Performance of Mac apps and Windows apps is superb.I am using a WD Passport 320GB USB drive for backups with Time Machine.Battery:Last about 2.5-3 hours with almost constant usage. The best thing is when I close the lid,it goes to sleep instantly, and wakes up instantly when I need it again, with no loss ofbattery regardless of how long it sleeps. That is VERY DIFFERENT from my experience withWindows laptops that lose battery even when sleeping. No idea why.Storage:It came with a 5400RPM 250GB HD. I bought a WD 7200RPM 320GB with a big buffer fromNewegg - I plan to swap out the HD - that  requires \"minor surgery\" so I am doing my researchbefore I do it this weekend. The new disk will be a lot faster, although the it comes withseems to be pretty fast already. I am swapping as I like doing stuff like that.UPDATE: I swapped the hard drive and did a full restore from Time Machine - it now is exactlythe same as my las back-up with all apps and settings, except with a bigger and faster hard drive.This \"surgery\" is t for the faint of heart. :-) And is probably totally unnecessary for most folks.Mac OS X:So simple. After using Windows PCs and laptops for over 15 years, I am amazed how easyand intuitive it was to use a new OS. I know Mac OS X is very powerful and I am just beginningto learn the advanced features to play with. Being able to run Windows XP in a VM with such a smallload on the system is very nice. I use software apps that are either not available on the Mac yet,or have much older versions on the Mac. This is not specifically about the MacBook Pro but thefact that the MacBook Pro has enough juice to do this is what is worth noting.Boot Times:When I shutdown and restart,  it comes up in 30 seconds or so. Much faster than my experiencewith Windows laptops. Here's the best part - if I put the Windows VM to sleep in my Mac,it comes back up in seconds! Much faster than Windows used to wake up on a Windows laptop!So for a portable laptop, the MacBook Pro is quite powerful and fast.Overall:I am glad I bought this model instead of the new Unibody model. This is by far the best portable computerI have ever owned. I've always felt that the MacBook Pro carries a price premium over \"equivalent\" ormore feature rich Windows laptops, but now I know why. They are better.","Date":"November 12, 2008"}
{"Title":"2 weeks into the switch","Author":"Software Craftsman","ReviewID":"R3BU15IBGYAQM9","Overall":"good","Content":"There was no reason for me to switch to a Mac product.  I've always have been intrigued, but XP was doing it for me day in and out.  My current Dell Latitude was on its way out and I wanted something high quality.  I couldn't find anything that comes close in build quality/finish to the Macbook Pro.  Asus makes some nice notebooks but I didn't want Vista, with all of its assorted issues and XP doesn't seem like a sound choice given its looming end of life.So now I have my Macbook Pro.  As a software developer I was drawn to the idea of a UNIX shell as a first class citizen (sorry Cygwin).  The toughest part is learning the keys.  In XP I could move around an IDE effortlessly, with keys: home,end,ctrl-arrow etc.; not so on the Mac keyboard.  This proved the most frustrating.  The lack of the forward delete is also a disappointment but I hear there are keyboard mapping solutions.I installed VMware Fusion and XP for initial comfort and to ease the transition off windows.  BTW, Fusion is amazing.  It feels like it's native, and it's definitely faster than XP on my current Dell.  With Fusion, I can map drives, cut and paste and access servers between the two -- it's all very fluid.  Full screen your Fusion in a different Expose window and you can quickly swap back and forth between Mac and XP.Now the downside.  In the first few days I experienced no less than 4 crashes, where it had to be power cycled.  I haven't had any issues since, so I'm going to conveniently forget.  Firefox crashes still, but no more than it did on windows, and maybe less.So in conclusion, Mac was the right choice for me.  High quality in and out and at a decent price.  The interface is pure eye candy and orders of magnitude superior (usability-wise) than XP.  While there will be some pain points in learning, it will hopefully be worth it.  Get VMware Fusion and install Windows for when there is no Mac alternative.*UPDATE* I have now had the macbook pro for 2 months.  I'm really enjoying some of the UI features, such as expose and spaces more and more.  The hotkeys are awesome (e.g. show desktop, lock/start screensaver).There are however a few recurring problems that I have been experiencing.  I'm going to detail the top two.  The first issue is the screensaver hotkey stops working at times.  This is a huge issue because it is also the mechanism for locking my computer, and I cannot leave my desk w/o locking it, so I must either close the lid (sleep) or restart, which fixes the issue.Now for the second issue: often when I try and restart/shutdown, it does nothing, then a minute later tells me that Finder failed to quit and I should quit Finder then try again -- great suggestion Apple, given that you CAN'T QUIT FINDER!! So now I have to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to kill it or run \"sudo shutdown -r now\" from Terminal.So in my latest conclusion, my mac is not living up to my expectations of reliability.  I was led to believe, by many in the mac community/stupid commercials, that Mac was the panacea from XP.  The Mac user interface is *unmatched* and that along with the UNIX foundation were and still are my original reasons for choosing Mac.  My previous XP Pro notebook however was significantly more stable.  The reliability issues are getting more and more annoying and I just hope Apple is able to resolve and restore my faith in their product.  Lastly, I would change the star rating to three but it won't seem to let me.","Date":"April 25, 2008"}

It is indeed a very significant upgrade to my 1st Generation MBP.  I won't get into nitty gritty tech specs, as most people I know buy Macs because they want to use their computer, not the other way around.The screen is a lot crisper.  My understanding is that it's an LED-based screen, which results in increased battery life.  On the topic of battery life, out of the box I'm getting 4.5-5.0 hours worth of battery life--dramatically better than the 3 hours max I got out of my 1st gen MBP.The processing power is dramatically increased, as well.  I never had trouble running anything on the old MBP until I got Parallels--I had to upgrade the old machine to 2 GB of RAM to get performance to an acceptable level and even then it was sluggish.  Not the case with the 2.4 Ghz MBP with 2 GB of RAM.Boot up time is significantly increased with this machine and the wireless seems to have extended range versus the prior version.  I attribute part of this to using an 802.11n base station, but I also notice that I pick up more WiFi access points near me, as well and some of them are Belkin 802.11g.The one thing that I do find annoying is that Apple changed the assignments for the function keys.  Having used Mac laptops for ~5 years, I found this to be very annoying.  I was able to work around this by changing the key assignments back to what I know.In all, a phenomenal upgrade in terms of what you get out of the box, raw processing power, boot time, and increased battery life.  I recommend this laptop without hesitation.","Date":"May 11, 2008"}

I remember when windows 95 first came out and how bad Macs sucked back then.  However times change.  The main thing that did it for me was that I could have both windows and OSX on the same machine using boot disk.  The verdict, I am now a Mac man.  And no I don't have the little apple sticker on the back of my car window in case you are wondering.Boot Disk works flawlessly and when I boot up windows (mainly for work) it is like I have a PC, (a really bad a** PC). When I first got it I thought I would be spending most of my time in windows using OSX for \"fun\" however after a week I realized that OS X Leopard blows windows out of the water.  Every aspect is better.  Let me say that again:  EVERY aspect of Leopard is better than windows XP.  I haven't found one thing in windows that I like better that what Leopard has.  Apple simply has the best user interface engineers on the planet working for them.  Now to be fair I haven't yet used Vista (haven't felt compelled at all so far based on what I have seen) so I don't have a basis for direct comparison to MS newest product.Wireless works great, bluetooth works flawlessly.  OH and the DVI out is amazing!  I can plug the DVI out to my receiver and watch full screen HD video on the plasma!  I tried this with my old PC, even bought a new video card to do it, but frankly it couldn't hold a candle to the mac.  Macbook pro also has Optical audio out for connection to the receiver, very nice. Speakers on the machine are better than average for a laptop but still not anything approaching audiophile quality.The machine comes packed with software that is actually useful, fun and has no crap on it.  ILife is great and easy to use.  The display is crisp, clear, vivid, etc, etc.  The best screen in the business.If I had to pick a con, I'd be price, though in comparison it is really not but a couple hundred bucks more than the equivalent PC.  What you get for that extra cash is a better user interface, better styling, smoother operation, faster performance. Personally I'd rather spend a few hundred bucks more and get more enjoyment, more functionality, and in the end more usefulness from the computer than to worry about saving $200 and end up with something that feels like it is just some \"tool\".  Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.","Date":"October 7, 2008"}
{"Title":"Happy Camper","Author":"mczilla","ReviewID":"RV0ZJD0NVOUSN","Overall":"good","Content":"It took me several months and a lot of research and in-store inspection before I bought this thing, and I'm happy to report no regrets so far. Actually, I'm glad I waited until the latest version came out. The new LED screen, faster processor, larger hard drive, bigger graphics card and included Boot Camp are definite pluses over the older models.I'm a graphics professional migrating from Windows and an old CRT, so the glossy screen doesn't present me with any new problems, and I find the rich colors and crisper text to be an advantage over the matt, but I admit this is a subjective call. The keyboard has a very easy and positive feel; lack of a numeric pad is no problem since I rarely used it when I had one. Serious design & bitmap work is done with an Intuos tablet anyway. The OS boots so much faster, and adapting to Leopard after Windows has not been difficult at all. Replacing the big monitor and brain-box with something this small had me wondering at first, but I now consider it to be a revelation.  Once the display is on it seems more than adequate. And there's always the satisfaction of Apple's \"slickness factor\" - beautiful industrial design, and an operating system that just makes me want to say \"cool\".","Date":"April 2, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"Thomas W. Meagher \"keypusher\"","ReviewID":"RNKSI28JINX44","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought mine refurb ~6 months ago.  I have had no problems whatsoever, and it has met or exceeded all demands I have placed at its feet.  This a powerful and well designed laptop in every regard.Operating System:  #1 Reason to buy an Apple laptop.  I run Windows and Linux on my desktop, but for a laptop there is no reason not to go with Apple.  OSX is better in every aspect than Windows, and getting Linux to work well on most laptops is a pain in the @%$.Screen - #1 Reason to get a MBP over a MB.  Get the matte screen.  It is simply the best laptop screen on the market.  Hands down.  I have received compliments on the actual screen from people sitting next to me.  When you see a Dell or even a Lenovo next to the MBP, their screen just looks incredibly sad, dull and washed out while the the LED backlit matte MBP is very bright and crisp.Size/Weight:  Weighs the same as the normal MB, but slightly larger.  Five pounds is actually quite light for a laptop of this caliber.  I would prefer a 13\" form factor but the MBP wins in other regards, and the larger screen is certainly welcome.  If SIZE is a major issue, you might want to consider the MB, if WEIGHT is the main issue, consider the MBA.  If you carry around a bunch of other heavy stuff or need to travel ultra-light, this may not be the laptop for you.  However, if all you carry around is a laptop, a (paper) notebook, and some papers or a book, it's not an even an issue.  I carry this laptop a few miles walking almost every day and I don't even notice it.Quality: Top notch.  Feels solid, unlike many PC manufacturers Apple uses top quality components for ram, motherboard, power supply, etc.  If anything fails, Apple support has always been refreshingly helpful and accommodating.Metal Case:  If it wasn't for the white plastic case, I might have bought the regular Macbook.  I think the metal case is more professional, but this may just be personal taste.  Realistically, the plastic MB is probably more durable and alledgedly gets better WiFi reception.Power:  Used for extensive coding, video editing, photoshop, video playback, running Matlab simulations, etc.  Hasn't failed me yet.Battery:  Decent battery life, nothing amazing.In conclusion, if you need ultra-light, get a Macbook Air.  For all-around use or students, I think the Macbook is the best bet.  This is because I slightly prefer the Macbook keyboard, mag-latch, and form factor.  But for the pro user that wants power, expandability, an amazing screen and a professional look, the Macbook Pro is the best laptop on the market.","Date":"April 13, 2008"}
{"Title":"10 minutes to freedom","Author":"Califrisco","ReviewID":"R2K5OOLBEEOO5L","Overall":"good","Content":"A mere 10 Minutes after I opened my new MacBook Pro, I had it up and running and I am writing my review here with it.  And that 10 min. would have been lessened had I not dawdled over the Apple screen cleaner and the user guide and so on. This is a sleek and fast machine; though it can get a bit warm on the left palm-rest I am loving this new machine. I'm adding Parallels and VM Ware Fusion as well to port over some of my Windows files. [BTW: You need Fusion only if you intend to run any 64-bit OS. And if you have XP like me Parallels supposedly runs it faster and more seamlessly according to Macworld]I am looking forward to a low-calorie Windows life now. :)Amazon even beat out a Mac Mall an identically spec'd refurbished MacBook Pro with this deal and with far less rebate hassle too!I could not have had a better experience with this entire purchase than through Amazon. Their tracking and quick delivery is exemplary. And this experience IMHO, is what the Mac Malls & Fry's of the world should be shooting for.Kudos both to Apple and Amazon.","Date":"March 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent Machine - Not going back to a PC anytime soon","Author":"King Cotton \"RWH\"","ReviewID":"R2VKWJLSO13HHW","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Apple MacBook Pro MB134LL/A 15.4\" Laptop (2.5 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive) from Amazon last month.  I love it.  I've been using PC based laptops for work and play for 15 years, and while I have dabbled on MacBooks (of various types) with friends over the years, this is my first Mac purchase and the first time I am using a Mac for work purposes.  In short, I could not be more satisfied with the machine itself.Externally, the 15.4 model is a sight to see.  It has an elegant, polished look about it.  More importantly, it has a sturdy feel to it.  So many PC laptops, including name brands (Dell, Compaq, etc.) have such a cheap, plastic feel about them, as if you could twist a little bit and something cheap would come flying off.  Not the MacBook Pro.  The aluminum shell and the solid body give it a confident feel, like it could take a little abuse if necessary.  The keyboard is just right: large keys, rightly placed, with a good feel--not to soft, not to much of a click.  That the FN function keys come set to serve as hardware options by default and Fn keys (F1, F2, etc.) only while holding down the Fn key seems backwards ... but its a simple switch in Preferences.  The ports on the sides seem sturdy and well place.  At first, I thought I would miss having all the ports tucked away on the back of the machine (as in the case of many PC laptops), but in the real world this has not turned out to be so bad after all.  Given the $2500 investment, I purchased a Speck clear cover and some ApplePeelz stick-on wrist guards, just to the keep the dings and sweat/grease stains to a minimum.  After all, I'm planning to take this machine for the long-haul.In terms of performance, the elegance on the outside is matched by the gears on the inside.  It really moves along.  I ponied up for some more RAM, making it a 4 gig machine, because I figured if I was paying $2500 for a machine, I may as well trick it out.  I run a typical suite of office programs - email, web, Microsoft Office, iTunes, syncing to a smartphone, scholarly research software, etc. - and the MacBook does great.  8 to 10 programs open at a time and not hesitation whatsoever.  And unlike Windows after 6 months, the overall system performance has not lagged.  I can put the Mac to sleep 6 times a day, and it always wakes up ready to go, full speed ahead.Sure, $2500 is (these days) a real investment in a laptop.  So if you just want to drop a little coin for a simple, what-you-pay-for is what-you-get machine, don't get this one. But if you are looking for a machine that looks and runs great, with an operating system that is simple (but not simplistic) and has a polish and flair that Windows has never even approached, then consider this model.  I love it.","Date":"June 23, 2008"}
{"Title":"Get it while you can","Author":"Ryan","ReviewID":"R2UA95HNHX4CYK","Overall":"good","Content":"Amazon:Superb.  Bought the MacBook pro on Monday, received it on Thursday using free shipping.  The rebate is VERY easy to complete.  Took me about a minute to complete.  Seriously.  All is done online and you can check the status as well.Why I got this model:Spent a lot of time researching whether to get the early 2008 model or the late 2008 model.  Went with early 2008 for several reasons:1.) Price - saved hundreds versus the new Pros (even after all rebates from Amazon)2.) Matte screen - I got the MacBook Pro primarily for photography and didn't want glare causing me to keep bobbing my head when editing images.  I get enough headaches as it is.  Also didn't want it to limit where I work.  This may not be a big deal for everyone, but it was the main reason I even started to look at the older models.3.) More for the money - got the 2.5ghz, 512mb vram version for less money than the new 2.4ghz 256mb vram version.  Also has more L2 cache for whatever reason.  A speed test I came across on MacSales shows that this version of the MBP is actually faster than the new ones in about every category.  You can find the comparison in their memory sales section.4.) Perceived value - Just about three months ago, this model would have gone for the cost of the high end late 08 version brand new from Apple.  Now that the new version is out, I got this older version for significantly less than that.  Feels like a steal.MacBook Pro itself:As many people have written, I too am coming from the PC world over to the Mac world.  I have made the transition and, so far, am loving it.  I've always bought HP computers in the past and have purchased an Intel Core 2 Duo machine from HP...this computer breezes through everything way faster than any HP machine I've bought.  This is the first computer I've ever used that can actually keep up with me!  The build quality is solid.  It really is making working on a computer fun.  In fact, I wouldn't be writing this review if it weren't for the fact that I'm having fun just typing on the keyboard.  I've read some previous reviews saying that this laptop gets really hot...that hasn't been my experience.  I've been working on it for a solid 2 hours and it's very comfortable on my lap.  Yes, it's a little warm, but just warm.  Not hot.  Granted, I haven't been playing any games so if the warmth comes from the GPU, then I suppose I haven't given it a full test in that regard.  It's completely silent so far (again, something the GPU might change).I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I did A LOT of research on which model to buy, so there was no doubt in my mind that I was making the right decision.  I like the unibody case on the new Pros, but nothing else really makes me want to go that route.If you're considering this model, buy it while you can.  I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase so far.","Date":"December 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Notebook Perfection","Author":"Mutulu1","ReviewID":"R3CYKM36TF8IKO","Overall":"good","Content":"The macbook pro quite simply is the best notebook on the current market.  Currently on my third notebook ( the white & black macbook) I decided to upgrade to the pro.  If your like me and actually don't mind a larger notebook screen and paying for improved features, then this notebook is for you.  First off, you're getting a 2.4ghz processor (avoid the 2.5ghz pro, $500 for 1/10 faster processor and 50 gigs is not worth it to me), 200 gigs, dvd superdrive, 15.4 inch screen in either glossy or matted.  By the way, for those not sure which screen to choose, definitly go with the matted.  It's the best screen currently offered.  If you believe like me you purchase a notebook to mobilze it, then you are going to mind glare, shadows, sun, and other images showing up behind your screen.  It also makes sense if you are using the mbp for photo or video editing.  Glossy does not give you the true version of your images or video before moving them to dvd or image paper, rather what you look @ on matted is exactly what you're printing.  Gamers might prefer glossy.  The aluminum finish is flawless as well as the upgrades trackpad features similar to those on mba and the iphone.  I don't find myself using those features much, but it comes in handy when needed.  This machine is also an eye catcher.  i stopped @ panera bread w/ my wife after work to find 6 people asking me to see the pro.  This mbp is my primary computer (have a desktop pc and wife uses macbook white) and it's pretty much all i need.  Everything is on this computer and it doesn't miss a beat!  This machine is costly running @ 1,999.99.  However, you have to weigh the options; If you want a desktop notebook that has a large enough screen, tremendous features and fast processor and would like taking it on your deck, couch during a game, or to work, get this.  If you just need a machine parked @ the house for multiple users (family of 4??) this might not be the investment for you.  I prefer a computer for each person to avoid confusion.  Also recommend, Apeture 2, iWork, and time capsule for back up.  The only con I can give this machine is its opening latch button in the front.  I find it a bit small and you have to give it a good poke to open it.  That's pretty much it, get this machine!!","Date":"June 2, 2008"}

I am the happy owner of a 15\" 2.2 GHz Macbook Pro from the last generation.  I am upgrading to the 17\" in the near future.  This is NOT a review but simply a warning.  The Amazon listing is INCORRECT.  The 1680x1050 display is NOT lit by LED's.  It is lit by CCFL's, ONLY the 1920x1200 upgrade screen is lit by LED's.  This upgraded screen is NOT available on Amazon.com  (Please note that ALL 15\" Macbook Pro's are LED screens)There is a large difference in the quality between these two with LED's being superior.  The whites are much whiter, the contrast is better.  Though they claim both are 300nits brightness, I find the LED's to look much brighter (possibly the combination of  whites and the better contrast)  Also know that Apple claims the LED screen's (that being the 1920x1200 screen) efficiency gives it 30 extra minutes of battery life over the CCFL versions (1680x1050 screens)  I hope this helps.  These are really excellent notebooks.Please remember this ONLY applies to 17\" Macbook Pro's, ALL 15\" Pro's are LED.","Date":"March 7, 2008"}

{"Title":"Worth the 16 day wait!","Author":"Chef Paolo","ReviewID":"RAS5HN28C078L","Overall":"good","Content":"When I left for the US I knew that Apple will be updating the Macbook Pro so I sold my iBook back home. I assumed it would come out by mid-January during Macworld and I was very willing to wait at least a couple of months for it to come. Suffice to say it didn't happen with the bloody Macbook Air coming out so I ended up using a Vista PC *groan* for a month and went on a EEE PC *sigh* til yesterday. For those looking for a computer avoid Vista like taxes and go Linux or better yet a Mac.When ordered I had to wait 16 more days til it reached my doorstep as only Apple had it on stock until recently. I then bumped it to 4GB RAM as it was cheaper to buy it separately and do it yourself.So what's new you ask? Unlike older MBPs it runs really cool so the the heat sink fan just needs to operates at 2000 rpm most of the time. This simply means I can comfortably put the notebook on my lap and it doesn't sound like a dust buster. Battery lasts longer and I got the much talked about multitouch. Faster processor, more video memory and larger hard disc drive differentiates this base model from the previous generation.","Date":"March 14, 2008"}
{"Title":"MacBook Pro--Mostly Good","Author":"retired for GREAT","ReviewID":"RWRO4A99EKXNP","Overall":"good","Content":"I replaced my five year old iBook with this MacBook Pro because I did not want the glossy screen of the new MacBook and because the Amazon price after rebate for the early 2008 version of the Pro was close to the price I would have had to pay for the late 2008 MacBook.The Pro is a great machine and, of course performs much better than my old iBook except in one respect--wireless reception. My iBook never had any issues anywhere in the house. The Pro is MUCH weaker. At first I thought the Pro was defective, but after a call to AppleCare and a visit to the Apple Store Genius, I saw that it just required a stronger signal. Since I don't take my laptop out of the house, that's not as big an issue for me as it might be for others.I've repositioned my modem/router and I'm considering buying a 'n' router to replace my 'g' version, hoping it will work better.I do think that Apple should have been more attentive to wireless performance.

Ma","ReviewID":"RP64H8KQWXZDU","Overall":"good","Content":"I know I am not the first person to go over the two main issues, get the XPS at a huge discount and of course glossy or matted.  I wanted to share my experience with everyone and hopefully save you some time or even hassle.First off I specced a Dell XPS M1530 and saw that with some coupons I could get a much better PC at almost half the price.  Since I am not an advid Mac User this seemed like a better deal. I figured why pay more for OS X when Vista suits me just fine.  So I press the send button and placed my order.  Not being able to sleep at night I decided to see/feel the XPS at my local Bestbuy store.  First off the exterior of the Dell is quite nice and has a sturdy feel to it.  But when I opened the unit, the keboard wrist area looked kind of cheap.  I then booted it up and tried some videos / movies / games.  The one thing you will notice right away i that the speakers are AWFUL.  I was not expecting Bose like sound, but the sound reminded me of an old 386SX computer I use to have where all you needed was beeps and dings.  I went home cancelled my order with Dell.I knew I wanted th Apple MacBook Pro but then glossy or Matted.  After reading tons of reviews and opinions I decided the only way is to go down there.  I went to Apple and started looking at the screen side by side with pictures/movies/games.  Hands down in every aspect Glossy was much sharper clearer and color more vibrant.  I chose Glossy.Then of course do I get the 2.4 or 2.5 Mhz.  While I don't doubt that for some the $500.00 upgrade is needed, for most of us it is not.  By the time most programs (games) require 512VRAM the notebook would probably be outdated processor wise.  Added with the fact that Intel charges Apple about $75 for the upgraded chip it seems odd that Apple could slap us with $500.00.At the end I bough my MacBook Pro 2.4Mhz Glossy and LOVE IT.  I also took the apple salesman advice, \"you could always buy an external matted screen if you need to.\"  External matted screens are generally less expensive then their glossy counterparts.  There you go best of both worlds.I hope I have helped some of you but at the end of the day single best advice is to go and see for yourself.  That's what I did!","Date":"May 27, 2008"}

That quality on that is perspicuous. The iSight is not far off.9. Price: I got this when the new macbook pro came out. ~1650 (AR) for a high end macbook pro is unheard of.10. Performance Comparison: After looking at numerous sites on the performance comparisons between this macbook pro and the new one, I found out that there are not much differences to justify for the $1000 increase in price for the new one. Plus for the new one, in order to use the 9600M GT, you need to restart the laptop which defeats the purpose of gaming on mac.11.

{"Title":"MacBook Pro Delivers","Author":"Tgunnnzzz","ReviewID":"R2TOEW69SE4LF3","Overall":"good","Content":"The Apple MacBook Pro is an exceptionally amazing product.  I own the 15\" and have been completely satisfied with it's performance and abilities.  The stylish casing and ease of use made it my first choice when buying my newest addition to the family.  We loved it so much my wife also purchased one as well.  The first thing you will notice about this laptop is it's metal casing.  Providing a sturdy casing to protect the important internal parts, it is also very cool looking.  Opening it up you first are drawn to the black keyboard that illuminates according the light in the room.  Apple has done a great job with this feature. This is also prevalent in the screen as well.  Depending on the light in the room, it will dim accordingly automatically.  Once this machine is on and running you will be amazed at how easy it is to use.  When transition from a PC to a Mac I would recommend you purchase the one on one sessions for only $99.  You get a year of personal training sessions to help you learn how to use the Apple's software and hardware.  Transitioning for me only took about a month to get confident enough to use strictly Apple software.  Given you can install any Microsoft software including the OS like Microsoft XP.  Apple lets you retain a PC feel if you want by allowing Microsoft operating systems to be installed.  Try installing Apple's OS on a PC, won't happen unless you are a genius computer wizard.I purchased the iWork suite and have been completely satisfied with that as well.  I am able to quickly produce some professional quality materials such as newsletters and brochures.  Powerpoints are a breeze with Apple's default templates.  It is very simplistic and easy to use.  Overall I have been completely satisfied with my purchase.  I would highly recommend anyone in purchasing one.  While they are considerably higher priced, you get what you pay for.  I prefer quality over cost and the Apple is well worth the price.","Date":"February 19, 2011"}

{"Title":"Great Design, But Not Crazy About OS","Author":"dorigen","ReviewID":"R19SQG1ODICTGW","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is a beautifully designed laptop in every sense.  It is compact, light, smart, and great looking.  The aluminum case is rugged and durable.  The magnetic power adapter is genius.  The keyboard is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used.  The auto-dimming screen and keyboard lighting is awesome.  It is also extremely light for the size and comfortable to carry.  Quite frankly, for $2000 I would expect nothing less!My problem is with the OS.  It supposedly has a reputation for not crashing, yet it crashed twice the first day I got it while trying to use Open Office (a program I used on my PC regularly with no problems).  Additionally, I've had problems with the Finder- I would click on \"Go\" - \"Applications\" or another menu choice, and the window would appear for a nano-second and then disappear.  Very buggy.  I had to restart to get this to correct itself.Overall, the sturdiness and design is great, but I am unimpressed with the operating system.  Mac people have the perception that Windows crashes all the time, and that has not been my experience at all, and I'm actually having more trouble with Leopard than I have ever had with Windows.That said, with the fact that no other company offers a laptop option that is as attractive in design as Apple, this was really my only choice, and I do not regret it.  It has been worth the minor inconvenience I've had so far and I must admit some aspects of the OS are pretty cool, such as the stacks feature.  Hopefully it stops getting buggy on me!UPDATE:Haha, two days after I wrote this review the backlighting on the screen broke and I had to return it.  I went back to PC and have been on my Sony Vaio ever since.  I bought a second one for my business a few months later and both have been running strong without a problem.  Both Vaios didn't even add up to the cost of a single Mac Book Pro and they actually had faster processors, more memory, and more storage.  After a faulty iPod Photo and Macbook I won't be trying Apple again.  I'm actually embarrassed that I got so wrapped up in their marketing and ignored my better sense on value versus price!","Date":"April 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"Cool laptop, but over-priced","Author":"T. Son","ReviewID":"R3HRYJJ3II5FDV","Overall":"bad","Content":"Mac is a good OS with better user interface and integration than Windows.  Better tech support than some of the larger sellers like Dell, Lenovo and HP.  Smaller target from worm/virus attacks compared to Windows (this doesn't make Mac more secure, by the way).  Better multimedia apps which are already part of the OS.  Nice and hip design.  I can see why so many people gravitate toward Apple products these days.  Personally, though, I can't justify the extra cost for having a \"cool\" laptop.  And those extra features I mentioned are not enough to sway many seasoned PC users away from Mac unless one has money to burn....so to speak.I recently bought Dell Studio XPS16 with following configuration for my wife:  15.4-in screen, 2.53 ghz w/ 1033 FSB, 4 GB memory, 500 gb hard drive @7200 rpm, ATI graphic card with dedicated 512 mb memory.  I paid about $1250 including tax (free shipping).  My wife needs a solid performance to run memory-guzzling applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD and Autodesk Ravit.Similar MacBook pro on Apple website (with smaller hard drive and integrated graphic card) comes out to about $1860 with tax (based on CA sales tax).  One listed here on Amazon.com has lesser hardware specs than current one listed on Apple website, but is still selling for $1500.  You can do the math.  Cool design matters, but not for extra $250 to $600.Apple makes good products and made mundane computing products into something fashionable.  And it also knows people will pay premium to get it.  I may decide to get Mac one day, but definitely not at its current pricing.  It's simply overpriced for what it actually delivers.","Date":"August 6, 2009"}
{"Title":"macbook review from a linux user","Author":"James Bond","ReviewID":"RVUFZQYZT1F3E","Overall":"bad","Content":"Hardware -Review on hardware alone.  This model is by far the best value out of the entire macbook pro line.  I hate the glossy screen, and the price for the 2.6 chip or the 17\" vs the benefits of these upgrades, wasn't worth it to me.  Overall the hardware and design is solid.Software -This would be my biggest complaint.  As a Java developer I can't recommend mac os vs using linux especially polished distros like fedora, or ubuntu. Why ? well they only support java 5 32 bit and 64 bit, and only java 6 64 bit. For example most gui applications on the mac need to be paid for, when in linux most can be downloaded for free.  Now weather or not you care for the polish or the fancy graphics is a different concern.  I'm looking just overall quality and choice of software.  To make the os actually usable, you have to use several 3rd party software solutions.  Example Finder is the worse implementation of a file manager I have ever seen... thats why Path Finder is so popular. Expose is a terrible alternative to finding programs.  Just compare the actions taken looking for applications when using task bar vs expose. Skip the graphics and make it useful.  When having 15 - 20 applications open expose becomes unusable.  I think the keyboard layout of mac is terrible.  Just do a comparison on cut and paste.  When pressing command or apple button + c .. your hand is curled and awkward VS .. ctrl + c .. your hand is extended, and can reach other keys easily.  Just something as simple as that.. makes a big difference to me.  Now people say just use linux or windows .. in separate partition... well I payed the apple tax to be able to use mac os.Overall comparable hardware can be bought cheaper when deals come along, and can save about 500.  For the power of a *nix os and the polish of windows.. is good , especially if you are not a power user.  But overall for my needs, I would not make this mistake again.","Date":"November 26, 2008"}

This is my first Apple and I am replacing a Toshiba Satellite that has done me justice for these past 7 years.  I guess I can say my first 1 HOUR experience with this Apple was not so cozy.  The screen had troubles.  The brightness basically did not come to life... it never reached a brightness that I could see the menues on the screen completely.  Tried everything, brightness control, restart, everything the manual instructed.  I called Apple tech support, and the lady on the phone simply was short and unhelpful to me and left me with a unpositive experience (mind you I was open for suggestions and help because I reallllly wanted to get this cool computer to work).  So I took it back to the reseller and hopefully they do me justice...  they need to make sure they get an \"RA\" number from Apple before they can do anything.  Luckily, the second Apple tech support person I called from the reseller was a little more helpful but the computer still was broken out of the box.  So, the ball is in Apple's court I guess.  I hope that Apple will do the right thing and give an \"RA\" to the reseller and  just replace this computer with a \"new\" one.  So, this review will be completed at a later date, either with a Macbook Pro in hand or another brand i.e. Toshiba.","Date":"May 4, 2008"}

I can carry the IBM thinkpad to work in the morning and bring it back to home in the evening without power down for SEVERAL weeks, there was no issue at all. I thought I was little rough to the thinkpad so I power down this Mac everyday after the work, carefully carry it around, well, when it happens, it happens, all the sudden, it dies. I'm in the process to recover the data, I'm mad. I'll update the review later for the service experience, so far not very good either.Another issus is you can't fold down the screen compeletedly outwards, it will break it. Bad design, image accidentaly you push down the screen for better view angle and you could break it and that's not covered by warranties.Regardless how great the MacBook is, it's a great pain when your working computer dies, you need get it repaired, resintall the application, recover the data if possible, and re-do all your work if data is lost, what about the photos you took for the special moment yesterday that haven't upload yet... too bad.No, I don't want anything fancy, I just need a reliable PC to do my things (paper, dissertation, spreadsheet, make movies), which all PCs on the market can do.","Date":"October 9, 2008"}

Quite frankly I didn't think we would be writing any adverse review for any Apple product. But here I am doing just that and simply stated I would recommend that any of you considering this MacBook and who also rely heavily on wireless connectivity for your laptop to delay your purchase indefinitely until Apple has resolved an inherent wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5.I use this MacBook as my kitchen work station and rely completely on our wireless LAN (Apple Airport) as I have no ethernet port in the kitchen area of our house.  I am now experiencing numerous drop outs of both my internet connection and my LAN and this started after upgrading to Apple's OS 10.5.5 which appears to be the version that now comes installed on this laptop.In reviewing numerous posts on Apple's \"support\" web-site it is clear that a significant population of other users of this same MacBook have the identical wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5 and have been asking, pleading for help from Apple, e.g., that Apple fix their faulty software as in put it back through a full SQT. What we seem to have received is a Beta version they foisted on their customer base for debugging. I have yet to find anything on Apple's web-site offered by Apple that remotely addresses this problem.Although otherwise this MacBook is an excellent performer, in this day and age there is an absolute need for reliable laptop wireless connectivity. Therefore we are very disappointed in this product's wireless performance as well as Apple's apparent lack of concern for their loyal customer base. After all, what good is a laptop with random wireless connectivity?  One day of this failure mode is one day too many and It is doubtful we will purchase another Apple computer until our confidence in their quality and customer responsiveness is restored. At the very least Apple should issue a statement admitting to the problem, indicating they are attempting to resolve the problem and specify a planned date for its resolution.In the meantime buyer BEWARE of the Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black which is an expensive laptop that offers worthless wireless performance!!","Date":"December 4, 2008"}

The trackpad button would work very inconsistently especially when clicking on the right side and the left side of the button.  I did some research on it and after a few searches I found out that I had to put a tiny piece of folded paper inside the battery compartment to fix it. After I did this it worked fine but I wasn't about to pay a good amount of money on a defective macbook. So now I'm waiting on my replacement macbook that should arrive in the next few days. I'm crossing my fingers on this one.","Date":"November 15, 2008"}

{"Title":"MacBook Woes","Author":"Ed","ReviewID":"R14XFBICNGAD30","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased my MacBook almost three months ago based on the reviews. My mistake. I admit that I did expect to find the change from Windows to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.4) a challenge. What I did NOT expect was that the support personnel at Apple would be so poorly trained that their help was almost useless. The standard solution after 2-3 hours on the phone was to reinstall the operating system. Big mistake. I downloaded Adobe, and it would not work properly on this laptop. I could no longer open simple pdf files. So, I called Apple support. Two hours later I was told to archive and reinstall the operating system. After doing that I still couldn't view pdf files, but finally used spotlight to find that there was still a small adobe file that needed to be deleted. That whole problem should have been a 5 minute phone call.  Unfortunately now  the printer would not work. Two more hours on the phone, and the \"support tech\" told me to remove the printer and then add it back. Bingo, the printer now worked. But again, more wasted hours. The next day I tried to access the Itunes store. Nope, couldn't do that either anymore. Three more hours on the phone, and I was told that it isn't possible to access the Itunes store from a managed account. Interesting that I have been doing just that for the past three months. Bottom line, don't expect decent support from Apple. If you buy a Macbook, you are really on your own. If you are familiar with Apple computers or have superior technical skills, you should do OK. But if you are coming over from Windows, you will only find frustration and misery. I will attempt to force Apple to take this thing back, and give me a refund. If that fails, I will try to find someone who still thinks that Apple is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and sell this MacBook to them!!!","Date":"July 26, 2008"}

I purchased this due to my son wanting to use this for school and college next year.  We got it and he played around with it for a few weeks and then he was using his windows laptop and PC???So I get it and use it for about 2 weeks.  What a joke!  Overpriced hardware and software that works with nothing else.  For my work I have certain pieces of software that require windows.  OK so run Windows under the Mac OS and/or dual boot.  I did both and ended up working in windows for most of the time!So tell me why I overpaid for average hardware (I do not like the macbook keyboard layout at all) and then ended up running Windows XP on it most of the time?  Either needed software that was Windows only (blame my vendors that I work with) or needing Internet Explorer for my company and vendor's web sites to work properly.Unless you just want to surf the internet and write a few documents then skip the hype.  Also try enjoy trading files between the two OS's (must share via a FAT32 partition) or use some other tool.  I do not have one vender that uses Macs and maybe 1 client.  So if you like to think you are really smart and be on a differnet platform than most other people then get this.  Or save your money and run Linux on standard HW.Windows is not perfect, but neither is Apple and I will never make this mistake again.

This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 1+ year I owned it. I won't go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.The last issue I had was just this week. The screen began to flicker constantly and I was about to take it to my local Apple store when my wife accidently spilled water on the keyboard. As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage. Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 for parts/labor to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I can't believe the Mac \"genius\" even suggested repairing it when a new unit costs that much.I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and have owned many of their products. I have bought and recommended Power Macs G4/G5, MacBooks/Pro, iMacs, CinemaDisplays, MacPros, you name it!

I called immediately (this was still Saturday evening) and talked to telephone operator Lisa, but got the sad news that \"The order has already been processed.\" If I had known Amazon meant nine days when they said three, I would have ordered express overnight delivery.

Then, after dangling on hold for 20 minutes, I talked with manager Kevin. He told me that \"three-day shipping\" means \"three to five days\". He explained, as had the three operators, that the only way to receive a computer before next Monday would be to give Amazon another $1000 plus the charge for overnight shipping and refuse the \"first\" order when it arrives.I know everybody has a sob story, but this MacBook was to replace a damaged computer for a blind woman.

A machine that does anything and everything for gaming, with state of the art sound and graphics. Alienware claims it has award winning customer service and a computer that I nicknamed RAMBO, before I bought one.With mods, my alienware desktop replacement cost 4700.00. It is by far, the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a computer, and it has been sitting in my closet for nearly a year after I purchased it. Multiple crashes, both hdd's stripped and the machine in general was so hot at times, it would burn not only a flat surface but would retain the heat long after the machine was off. Save the argument that a large replacement desktop would do that in general, the machine has nearly not enough adequate fans to carry the weight and heft of such a system.I cannot urge you enough, no matter how slick and stylish the ads may be and how amazing the clock speeds are that alienware claims (you can build your own and clock it at whatever you like, you don't need the name alienware to do it), never, ever purchase anything from this company.The customer service was tiresome, nauseating and paltry.

We bought the M9750 laptop about 18 months ago and spent a fortune.  My son had saved up much of the money himself and was excited to pick this one out.  It was sent in for repairs at least twice. On the 2nd time, they returned it and it still wasn't fixed, they had installed the motherboard improperly.  When we called to tell them, they tried to act like WE had done something to break it again.  Finally they agreed to fix it for the third repair.  At this repair, when they mailed it back to us, it was misplaced by Fedex! [...] I also found out that they settled with Fedex two months previously, but yet they still jacked me around for additional months.  Ok, so they picked a computer to replace our lost computer with, and it's not as good of a computer.  But there's nothing I can do, I have complained and argued and begged, but they are sending me a basic model laptop that doesn't even compare to the expensive one that we purchased.  They swear that it's even better than my old one, but this is only because technology has improved, it's not because it's a comparably priced computer.  Even the case isn't as cool as the one we originally had, but they don't care.  We don't have a choice.  They were rude, and no one ever once apologized to us that they and Fedex had lost our laptop -- they treated me like a thief and even admitted to me that my account was \"flagged for possible fraud\"!  What?  Are you kidding me?  We sent in a laptop for repairs back in April 2009 and have never seen it or a replacement product since.  Apparently I will be getting a new laptop this week, but it doesn't begin to fix the time lost and the aggravation of all these months.

Worlds apart!!!!UPDATE=============More Alienware/Dell Problems===========Poor Design=====Bad Hinges====Lack of Cooling===FAILWell, it looks like at least some Alienware M17x laptop owners just can't catch a break. While the previous so-called DPC latency issue has apparently finally been resolved, a number of users are now reporting another issue that's only become apparent after the earlier problem was fixed. As it turns out, the symptoms are similar to the stuttering caused by the DPC latency issue (hence the confusion), but the new problems are being blamed on power issues -- namely, that the GPU is drawing more power than the laptop can provide. Worse still is that it seems like those with the highest-end configuration are the most likely to experience the problem, as they're effectively maxing out an already maxed-out system. For its part, Dell has apparently fixed the issue in the most recent revision of the laptop, but users on the Notebook Review forums are reporting that the company hasn't exactly been eager to dish out replacements for everyone affected (which seems to be the only surefire \"fix\" available).Source:  Notebook Review","Date":"September 10, 2010"}

There are much better laptops available. Be aware the price offered here at Amazon by third party dealers is not the cheapest available. Apple sells it for less than the current price shown. The strongest thing going for the system is it's operating system which gives a brief breath of fresh air from the coldness found in Windows. There is also a strong community of users who will help you out and a friendly customer service team.The main issues are a screen which is horrific. Apple can no longer be known for graphics. The maximum resolution found on the screen is less than other models sold by their competitors. This is how this system was designed. Investigate.The MacBook Pro screens have a defect affecting most of the production currently. The lower 1/3 of the screen will have a yellowish/golden hue. The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line. The tones from top to bottom are inconsistent. The screens background helps to mask the problem but you will see it if you ever do any work with the system.The viewing angle is very narrow. If your head leaves a 4 inch box the screen is almost unreadible and will be golden in color. This is due to the \"LED\" backlighting system. Investigate.If you are still intent on an Macbook look at the 17 inch model. You will notice the 17\" is the most commonly reviewed model because the other ones will be horribly received. It does not use the LED backlighting and the maximum resolution is higher.The second main issue is something Mac users are referring to as \"Kernel panic\". It is the same thing as Microsoft's notorius \"blue screen of death\"except the cause is the hardware. Should your system have \"kernel panic\" you will have a locked up, unusable system. The work will have gone unsaved and you will be out of the notebook for 3 weeks as they repair the brand new system. Investigate this further.Yes, stick a fork in it.

No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.

{"Title":"No Apple Phone support for this amazon purchase","Author":"Jam \"Jam\"","ReviewID":"RQL9BCNNWWU00","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this from Amazon, (Config:2.66Ghz 6M-L2 cache/320G hdd/ 4Gb Ram).1. When I tried to get apple 90 day phone support, Apple recognizes the serial number as 4 month old, so no help in configuring any network/firewall. I'm a first time mac user, switching from PC.2. Apple dropped the price on this item by about 400 dollars. I cannot exchange with Amazon, or get a refund, although I'm within the 30 day return period. They want a minimum 15% restock fee. Just got off the phone with a Codie B, supervisor at Amazon customer service. They are absolutely no help, wish I had bought this at my local BEST BUY, where there is price match/guarantee.3. I'm very disappointed that Amazon treats a loyal regular customer this way. Now ex-customer.All rantings and frustration aside, This is a Fantastic Product from Apple. Being a first time Mac user, coming from a predominantly Linux and Windows world, the mac hardware is the tops. Not to mention Leopard, has everything I need. I eventually set up my firewall,( ipfw script with a startup plist in /System dir). As I come from a Unix b/g, I'm comfortable with configuration, a little phone help from apple would have been much appreciated, and deserved, after paying so much.I rate 1 star for my experience with buying this from Amazon.The product itself would rate 5 stars.I had done a lot of research, before buying, and nobody else offers the same top level hardware and OS that will do everything you ask of it.Some of the goodies, out of the box, like, In built VNC(server and client), SMB print/file sharing, Security, and amazing speed. Top that with no extra anti-virus s/w or subscriptions to purchase like some other OSes. I get a battery duration of about 5.5 hours, when I just browse/read. The list goes on, DiskUtility that can resize and partition without destroying data, multi-touch trackpad while reading, very small os memory footprint,  Xcode looks very promising... I found a freeware utility that will \"burn\" Audio-DVD too, along with other formats.Apple has a this approach, of exposing elegant and minimal menus on the outside to users, but as we dig deeper, are rewarded with more and more details. As you delve deeper, more details and options are available.All in all my personal opinion: If you are planning to buy this, look at the new 15inch, 2.8 Ghz configuration, it has the same 6Mb L2 cache, that's touted as the number one reason for performance increase by Intel. Just dont buy from Amazon. :-)","Date":"June 11, 2009"}

But, the screen is constantly flickering and the flickering becomes worse with each passing week. There are thousands of articles on the Internet about users experiencing similar problems due to defective NVIDIA chips in these machines. I've spent hours on the phone with Apple Support and they refuse to accept the machine for repair because I cannot force it to flicker on demand and they won't acknowledge the problem as their responsibility if it is intermittent in nature. I wrote to Apple corporate legal directly and they ignored my letter and sent it back to customer service for a boilerplate reply. Unfortunately, when I pay full retail to buy a machine at this price point, and I'm treated like this, it's impossible to offer more than a 1 star review.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dead Pixel's are common","Author":"John Doe","ReviewID":"R2M0ZJ5P8GS6RD","Overall":"bad","Content":"I gave this one star mainly to bring attention to a common MBP problem.  My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be \"Materially Defective\" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.  In all other ways I am very happy with the MBP as I am a convert from Dell.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

You can read the other reviews to hear the Apple fanboys gush. Generally, Apple products have good ideas but poor engineering.Negatives- My spacebar stopped working a few weeks into actually using this laptop. I had to pry it off so I can touch the sensor directly in order to type this review. If you look at how the keyboard was designed from the inside, it's not surprising that it has issues.- The dual-link dvi cable (after waiting for months for it to come out after being on back order) wigs out and starts displaying junk on 30\" monitors. Apple later declared retroactively that the cable will only work on Apple branded 30\" monitors. A lot of people are upset about this.- Given the size of the screen, the screen real-estate (measured in pixels) is very small. Especially sucks if your 30\" monitor is dead in the water.- The edges of the laptop are sharp.- The laptop only opens to ~130 degrees,- Runs hot.- Fan goes crazy if the bottom is covered up.- Optical drive makes noise everytime you wake the laptop.","Date":"January 20, 2009"}
{"Title":"Over priced under proforming computer.","Author":"Deimos \".\"","ReviewID":"R22YZ1TR7WPRHX","Overall":"bad","Content":"OK so I have used both versions of Macbook pro and I can attest to the fact that there is no way in hell that this system is worth nearly 3000$. OS X is a so so OS, the system runs ok same as any other MAC I guess. I bought an ACER Extenza 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM, 320gb HD w. Vista Home Premium and it's way faster then the macbook pro. At which time I realized that the macbook pro had cost me three times as much for less performance and speed...plus no games and minimal apple only applications/software. For the price macbook pro's should be a hell of alot faster. Plus in a few years....good luck upgrading. The DVD/CD rom drive sucks because unlike my ACER or any PC/laptop it doesen't have the eject button right on the dvd drive, so if your MAC locks up (which it will) there's no way to eject the cd/dvd (yes I tried to keyboard eject button) with the mac locked up it's useless. I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple. No MAC is worth the asking price, they are generally slower than any PC/Windows based Laptop I have ever compared it too and are severly limited compared to windows users. Save your money, buy a high end windows laptop and a PC together for less then what Apple wants for their Macbooks. Next off, as stated this laptop is half as fast as an ACER Extanza or Gateway T-Series with the same specs. The pro gets boiling hot when running simple apps, and even gets so hot it could damn near start a fire, it's hot enough that you can bearly stand to touch it near the battery and under the screen/keyboard. It can't run windows for crap, even with boot camp. I boot camped Windows XP and the mac pro had an extremely hard time running it, taking forever to boot up and shut down, im talking like 10 mins. That goes to show that windows based laptops (PC's) are faster and better. Little heat, top notch speed (totally smoked the macbook pro easily). A mac runs OS X duh good but can't even handle XP......sad. Mac sucks. Overpriced BS.","Date":"January 29, 2009"}

I tried messing around with the word wrap and stuff, but with the price of this notebook, this is not right.2.Price3.Latch on back is almost too easy to open and get to the hard drive, etc.4.Only 2 USB Ports, what are they thinking?5.No HDMI Port6.Hardly any products are made for MAC still, they are all windows only.7.Text in Safari is very hard to read just like Textedit.I've read all the reviews on the laptop and I feel that most people are just Mac Fanboys and don't give honest reviews.  I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback). God loves you.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}

{"Title":"Honestly? It just sucks","Author":"C. Shapiro","ReviewID":"R27WJKKDJON5XE","Overall":"bad","Content":"I can't remember the specifics of the older model Dell laptop I had for four years, but I loved it & it treated me well. The only reason I bought a new one was because the hard drive popped out of the old one, & before I realized it could just be popped back in I had already ordered the 1525.This computer is like an $800 headache. I don't even care that it came with Vista, because honestly it hasn't given me that many problems & I'm not picky about my operating platform, so long as it gets the job done. (Although, I will say, it comes with a completely useless graphics driver, & I had to downgrade to the previous edition of the driver to get basic games to run.) I've been lucky & haven't had the battery or trackpad problems everybody else complains about. But even as one of the \"lucky\" ones, I'd had to deal with my fair share of crap from this model.1. The left mouse button is permanently stuck in the down position. It still functions, but it doesn't have that satisfying \"click\" that mouse buttons are supposed to have. This may sound like a superficial problem, but it's not. You want to know when you've clicked the mouse. As far as I can tell from browsing message boards & forums, everybody who has this computer has this problem. As an Inspiron 1525 owner, it's something you'll just come to accept.2. Like many people have noted, it gets hot. Dangerously hot. Not a \"lap\" top.3. The screen! Bane of my existence!a. First of all, there's no clasp or magnets to ANYTHING to hold the screen down when it's closed. What's up with that, Dell? If you're carrying your laptop in a bag or something the screen just flops around, bouncing as it pleases off the keyboard. Well, you know... WHO EXPECTS LAPTOPS TO BE PORTABLE ANYWAY?b. MAJOR MAJOR HINGE PROBLEMS. I've just spent the last week of my life without a computer at all because I had to order new hinges. The screws holding the display together are so weak & the plastic so flimsy that the metal hinges work themselves out of alignment in no time, causing the laptop to give a mighty CRACK when you open it & eventually causing the metal hinge to become exposed &, in my case, non-functional. This can be dangerous, as the trauma caused by the cracking or hinge popping out can crack the screen. Luckily, my screen was unaffected. But I had to take the whole display apart myself & replace the stupid hinges. Now it's working fine, better than it did when I got it actually -- makes me wonder if the people at Dell even bothered to screw the hinges in all the way or not. But I know this problem will resurface again in no time & need constant surveillance & maintenance. Who needs a laptop they're going to have to dissect every six months? It's ludicrous.You know, I'm absolutely not a picky person. I'm just a regular chick who needs a laptop for work, school, & play. I'm not some tech geek who feels it's my job to complain about every flaw in a gadget in order to make myself feel superior. I am the Everyman. I don't know anything about laptops. All I know is that I have had this computer for a little over a year (ONE YEAR, A SINGLE MEASLY YEAR) & it has caused me nothing but stress. When I buy an expensive electronic, I expect it to work, & not to break until I've dropped it or at least gotten a few good years of use out of it. I don't have money to throw around on upgrades or new equipment. No matter how low the price, this laptop just isn't worth the time, money, or trouble. It's a big, overheating, screen-cracking, mouse-malfunctioning, bulky piece of junk.","Date":"March 19, 2010"}

I should have had 3GB. I didn't realize it until after my warranty was up.  They outsourced their customer service to India. Try getting them to understand anything you are saying.

Although you have many features and seemingly high end components, you will be disappointed with performance.Primarily, you will be very dissatisfied with:- the trackpad pointer, which is erratic and buggy for which Dell has no fixes, nor are any forthcoming- the CD/DVD tray phantom ejection problem, which is also well documented by users on Dell's own customer web site; again no fix forthcoming- loads of adware/Dell-promos which get annoying and will make you wipe your HDD to start fresh.Avoid the Inspiron line altogether. Dell has dropped the ball completely here.Disclaimer: I currently have a higher end Dell Inspiron with a full Core2Duo/250GB/3GB. I have tried to use the Dell/Best Buy Geek Squad coverage, but this is a un-usable perk, since Dell will do nothing except refer you to Best Buy, who will insist on taking the laptop from you for an indeterminate period (last time it was for 2 months, with them saying they couldn't fix it, and provided another faulty replacement).

Dell support is saying that there is a crack in the screen and it's my fault and is now being transferred to their 'holding' department which is basically the place computers go when the warranty is not being honored.  No mention of the ac adapter and when I asked they just said that the computer will be in the hold department tomorrow and gave me a number to call and check in .

Now I think iPhone beats it for its portability and weight if I am going to use it only for internet access. For other uses nothing like normal laptop or a desktop. Never use netbook as your primary computer.Dell is very shady about prices of their warranty extension. They quoted me a warranty price that was almost equivalent to the price of netbook itself. They do not have fixed warranty prices on their website, but they give ridiculously high priced quotes when you call their support center. I was asking for an extension on the existing warranty and they were tricking me with ridiculous price for upgrade, without informing me. Luckily I spotted it. Never take them at a face value.

The keys are spaced so disfunctionally close together if you're thinking of using it for word prosessing or typing of any sort you're going to need the time and patience of a saint.The mouse has a mind of its own,click on one thing it will bring up another, click once it will click twice, click twice it will take 5 seconds to recognise any of your clicks - so slow to catch up with your requests for navigation/commands! AAARGH! Battery life? What battery life? After fully charging it all day I am now sat here half an hour into my work and the battery is already on half life?! I've had this waste of money for less than a year and it has been like this from day one. After 2 hours max you'll get a warning to plug in as you're on 14% of battery life left - this works out in actual terms to be approx 2 mins to find, plug in the charger and avoid losing your work/page. It's quite a race against the clock!Screen is shocking, can't see photo's/pictures/links/emails in their full glory due to this 'mini' design. Some websites are difficult to use (I shop on the net quite often) because you can't view the whole page therefore it's difficult to select things, compare, view options, difficult to explain but more often than not I have to select one thing at the top of the page, use the arrow key on the right to get to bottom of page ( another infuriating task) and then select or read what you want from the botoom of the page, a page which on any self respecting laptop could be viewed in FULL!I can't seem to copy and paste on this thing either, comes up with some ghostly blue arrow when I highlight then right click, instead of coming up with the box that allows you to select to copy then paste. No disc drive? What's that all about?! Speakers are pitiful, very tinny and volume wise - very low output. You'd need separate speakers to listen to anything worth taking note of. Memory is rediculously slow despite having hardly anything stored on here and had extra memory installed.Finally please don't waste your money. It maybe slightly cheaper than your average laptop but the money you save you'll be using to visit the local internet cafe to get the speed you want, page size you need and efficiency which every computer user deserves.

{"Title":"WARNING: DELL WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY!","Author":"Shawn Wale \"MindsEye\"","ReviewID":"R3PMY8VH0EZCKP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I ordered a Dell Inspiron laptop 1 1/2 years ago and it worked great until recently.  The screen went black and the system would not start.  Turned out that the video card had failed.I contacted Dell customer support to activate my next business day warranty and after more than a week I have gotten nowhere with them.  My claim has been \"escalated\" twice with the same excuses and refusal to fix the problem.  They claim they have no video cards in stock and I will have to wait 2-3 weeks for a replacement card, 2-3 weeks for a loaner system, or 2-3 weeks for a replacement system -- basically my NEXT DAY warranty is anything but.I explained that this is a mission critical system and a 2-3 week delay is unacceptable given the high price I paid for the next day warranty.  I offered to take another make or model of graphics card and even offered to go buy the card myself if the agreed to pay for it.They refused to help in any way.  So, I am left with a useless laptop for 2-3 weeks until it becomes convenient for them to honor the warranty.  I will never buy another Dell product again and recommend that others who are not technically experienced with fixing computers or that need a \"mission critical\" system that they look elsewhere because Dell cannot be relied upon to fix broken systems in a timely manner.","Date":"March 5, 2009"}
{"Title":"The worst laptop","Author":"ALY","ReviewID":"R3DZFRVT79YTFK","Overall":"bad","Content":"The worst laptop I have ever seen in my life time. The main problem is that Video card or graphic card, which is on board, gets overheated amazingly fast once you power on the laptop. For instance, the heat of video card kick in at 80 C degree. I guess it is a design flaw that there is not enough capability for cooling the video card in this laptop. Also, Dell is very reluctant to change video card because the motherboard needs changing with a new one and cost a bundle to DEll.Never buy a laptop from Dell. Once you have a problem with your laptop, they just ignore you.","Date":"February 23, 2010"}
{"Title":"Over priced rip off.","Author":"Deimos \".\"","ReviewID":"R1CIQSMOGXC2MF","Overall":"bad","Content":"I paid 2000 dollars when I custom built one of these systems from Dell's online store.  At first the system running Vista home premium was great, fast and ran all the programs and games I could ever want.  After about 3 months the wireless card began failing, dropping connections and then died altogether.  So I purchased a D-link wireless adapter and my wireless was faster then it had ever been with the crappy Dell wireless mini card.  At this time I really began to also notice the system starting to degrade in performance big time.  I was running 64bit Vista and the 6gb ram wasn't even noticeable as it increased nothing and was a waste of money to add to this system.  The XPS was now performing slower than my year old Gateway T series, and the XPS had dual core processor, 6gb ram, Nvidia video card, etc  The boot up times got a lot longer too and it seems with the XPS that by just installing programs (even small ones) or games that the system got progressively slower even though it was built and paid for to handle it.  The laptop gets extremely hot and unstable when playing games like Oblivion or even watching youtube which Im puzzled with.  Also now when playing games and starting up the system crashes several times a week for no reason other than cheap unreliable hardware.  Another extremely stupid, annoying feature of any dell notebook I have used (XPS, Inspirion, Latitude) is after ripping approx two cd's worth of music or burning two or three dvd/cd's or changing disc's the dvd rom slot loading drive stops working and goes missing from the my computer screen like you don't even have a dvd rom drive, how stupid is that.  This laptop sucks.  This will be my last Dell system as their 2000$ XPS or 500$ Inspirion or Latitude all have the same horrid performance and are nothing but the same cheap, unreliable garbage hardware with different housings.Oh and as the above reviewer said Dell does not stand by their warranty.  Here is the Dell Limited Warranty on their products and as you can read it covers basically nothing.What is not covered by this limited hardware warranty?This limited hardware warranty does not cover:Software, including the operating system and software added to the Dell-branded hardware products through our factory-integration system, third-party software, or the reloading of softwareNon-Dell branded products and accessoriesProblems that result from:External causes such as accident, abuse, misuse, or problems with electrical powerServicing not authorized by DellUsage that is not in accordance with product instructionsFailure to follow the product instructions or failure to perform preventive maintenanceProblems caused by using accessories, parts, or components not supplied by DellProducts with missing or altered Service Tags or serial numbersProducts for which Dell has not received paymentNormal wear and tearF-Dell.","Date":"May 3, 2009"}

I bought it to take on business trips. After about two years, it began acting erratically. As it was no longer under warranty, I took it to a local pc repairman who I've trusted with other computers. He said that Dell was aware that the Nvidia graphics card in this pc was prone to overheat. I had to replace the graphics card and motherboard for about $300. The replacement graphics card was upgraded to eliminate the overheating problem. Since it was fixed, I haven't had a problem.  If you bought this computer, watch out for a graphics card that overheats, even if you use it for routine work. And keep your warranty active.  Otherwise, it will cost you a bit more in the long run.

Mine is on one of the industries leading cooling units, because Gateway convinced me that my problem was an inadequate cooling unit, not an inadequate CPU.  And if you're like me and beyond frustrated when you finally call customer service, only to get someone who's accent is so thick you honestly can not understand a word they say, then you may find problems with their tech support as well.

I'm not sure where to start. I paid over 400.00 for the computer and thought I got a real bargain and boy was I wrong. Should have known there was a catch. We had it only a few days and it quit working. Taking the sellers word on the condition, I paid to have it looked at and told the tech what I had been told. He thought \"a graphics card.\" The seller knew that it was the motherboard with the graphics card integrated in it because when I told the seller what the tech said, he was very anxious to hear \"graphics card\" and said, really? The tech ran diagnostics and said it was(Of course it wasn't working, neither was the motherboard), but he didn't have one. I paid to have it shipped to Gateway dealer for repair. I'm starting to lose money at this point with shipping and paying for first tech. Gateway dealer said it's the motherboard with integrated graphics card. \"They are obsolete and you can't buy new or refurbished.\" I paid over 100.00 to that tech up front only to have it shipped back 3 weeks later not repaired. I sent it off again to a tech in Florida and paid 101.00. They said they'd be able to help. More shipping cost, it came back un-fixable. It now has a place on a shelf and won't even turn on.

Needed Linux as well as Windows, so I reformatted and installed duel boot, but games kept blowing up! Found out there were no recovery disks! You had to get them from this guy who seemed to be subcontracting from Gateway! Even with the recovery in place, the video was still messed up. Had to subscribe to a driver search service to locate them all. Games run for a little while and then the machine seizes and the hard drive starts making a grinding sound. The Gateway website has precisely \"0\" (zero) info on how to get support. To this day I don't have a clue how to call or email them. The warranty has a mailing address only.So I had to use it as is. It runs, but the video is wacked. Dropped a grand of precious resources and spent weeks dinking with it when I should have been concentrating on my schoolwork. People complain about Asus and MSI's foreign call centers, but at least they answer the phone. For me Gateway has been a slow grinding hell.

{"Title":"I will never buy sony again","Author":"Steve Smithwick","ReviewID":"R1NNU1R1DCLZKC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have always liked vaios and bought a viao z to replace my trusty old 10\" screen vaio tr.It worked fine apart from the scratches on the lcd caused by the keyboard and after 10 months the unit failed. Fair enough they do that, my Toshiba quosmio has been repaired 3 times.Sony however is different, the only way you can contact them is by phone and on a long automated option that left me on hold for 40 minutes at a time.My case was complicated in that I bought my vaio while working in San francisco and moved back to the UK with it. Sony Europe would not honour a US garrantee and so I was forced to send it at my expense to San Diego repair centre.So far I was not really upset, I thought it would return quickly, and I should not have bought such a portable world wide item in the wrong market, obviously you are not meant to travel with it.This is when Sony became a faceless uncaring organisation. Who would have thought a high tech compoany was unable to email its customer, or track its own records?In the mean time my quosmio went off to have a hard drive replaced no problem and returned.Still no word from Sony, After lots of phonecalls through their intermnible auto system and the 40 minute hold times i was told it was about to be estimated.after still more calls and hold times I was told that there would be a 824 dollar bill for non guaranteed repairs.The fault i reported was a failed hard drive!I was promised email contact but none ever came and I still do not have my 2000 dollar laptop back.Stick to Toshiba they care","Date":"November 2, 2009"}

{"Title":"Underwhelmed...","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R11OWZUT3Y5VQA","Overall":"bad","Content":"Got it last week. Looks great. Feels just perfect. It is an ideal travel laptop. Only one little problem. The unit comes with Vista without any hope (as of now) of downgrading to XP. Why downgrade? Well, because some applications will not run well on vista (or not at all), networking with other computers is a nightmare (if you have XP computers at home and want to share printers or a network drive with this laptop- well it is a shot in the dark and I still can't get it to work right despite hours spent online and on the machine), the OS seems to go out of its way to slow the machine down (a simple example - word2007 opens in less time on a three year old laptop running xp than on this one - and this after I used msconfig to disable most of the startup services).But I have to say, Vista looks really nice and if looks were all that mattered, and you did not need to interact with xp computers or are limited to running standard office applications - then it is a very nice laptop. Sony did a great job - too bad the OS is not pulling it's weight. Shame a great laptop gets dragged down by a lousy OS..","Date":"September 30, 2008"}

{"Title":"Horrible Out-of-the-Box Experience, NO XP Downgrade Available","Author":"R. Kennedy","ReviewID":"R2MRPRUVZ1U36M","Overall":"bad","Content":"I anxiously awiated the delivery of a Sony Z to replace my older TX series, and use my notebook as a road warrior and have always enjoyed Sony products.  However, this one disappointed me upon receipt as instead of spending an afternoon setting my computer up, I spent it on the phone with Sony Support.  If you look at the original listing/advert you see XP Downgrade listed about 3 times, however, a disc is NOT included with the computer, and after placing 3 phone calls to Sony Support, Parts & Accessories, and then Customer Relations, I have learned that one is not currently available with a delivery estimate given of November (it's currently August as I write this!).  This should be clearly noted in any advertisements, as many folks still use and rely upon Windows XP for work and I would not have ordered this computer at this time if I could not downgrade straight out of the box.  VERY disappointing.  I was angered enough to *not* find the downgrade disc included, but to learn that it was not contemplated to meet the release of the computer is negligent and misleading especially in light of the advertising.Other than that, computer looks nice, and reminds me of the TX/TZ with that extra inch or so that I always wanted without going to the size of a full notebook.  The power adapter is quite bulky and heavy compared with previous Sony Vaio power bricks and comes with a beefy 3-prong cord as well -- a lot of weight to add to an otherwise svelt computer.I am certain that others will buy and enjoy this computer, especially if you are OK with Windows Vista and don't require Windows XP for business.  But for those who do, it's a show stopper...and I would recommend that you wait until sony rectifies this and/or it is properly advertised.Software, especially an Operating System, is as important to the product as the hardware component.  Inasmuch as Sony didn't (and apparently cannot) currently deliver all that was clearly advertised, I am only giving the Sony Vaio VGNZ570N/B 1 star.","Date":"August 25, 2008"}

{"Title":"NOT worth the money!!! HORRIBLE","Author":"tAsTytEmPAi","ReviewID":"R3K1A9UN3HUQ8D","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this laptop just over 1.5 yrs ago, but finally decided it was time to write a review on this monstrosity.I paid over one thousand dollars for this, and having had positive experiences with HP in the past I thought this would be the perfect laptop to lug around when starting University.Okay, I will begin by saying that I hardly ever carry this laptop around, and usually keep it sat on my desk or use it while lying in bed. The few times I have traveled with it, it has been for short extents of time and I would carry it in a highly-padded computer bag. I am positive I took better care of my laptop than many people, however, I guess that doesn't change a thing if the laptop is already poorly made. I will now list the problems I have encountered in my DV5-1000us from the day I got it up until today (1.5 yrs later):*The easy pad (touchpad) controls stopped working many times during my first few months of use, however, now work 99% of the time. One thing that has not changed, although I believe this is simply a design flaw is that you can't skip, pause, play, or stop songs on itunes unless you have the itunes window displaying immediately infront of you. Because of this, I deem these controls useless since it's just as easy to press any of these buttons simply from the itunes window. It is also very annoying when you want to control itunes, but can't simply use the touchpad.*The sound card: This computer has an awful sound card simply because it continually turns on and off. I have a password-login which I must use to access my computer, but if the computer falls asleep, sometimes the sound card turns off which requires me to close and reopen my computer screen, relogin and then wait a minute for my computer to allow me to actually use it while it makes a loud engine sound. It's not that bad, but quite an annoying flaw.*The keyboard:After a few weeks of using my laptop, the keyboard buttons would easily jam and sometimes the plastic holding them to the laptop would pop up and the keys would essentially \"break.\" They all worked, however, many became loose or stiff after this.---And today my keyboard simply stopped working, so I am now typing on a usb keyboard (which is actually much better than my laptop keyboard and it only cost $18!) I should mention that although this laptop cost over one thousand dollars, the keyboard is not water resistant and also easily attracts dirt under the keys. It cost nearly $400 to fix my laptop keyboard (and I live in the Silicon Valley right next to HP!), and simply put: This computer itself isn't even worth $300-$400!*The \"paint job\" -- when you open up this laptop you will see \"small, smooth metal squares.\" These are painted on and can easily be chipped off -- my laptop is a perfect example!*The \"mouse paint job\" The mouse pad on this laptop is a great size and I love that it is centered, rather than placed to the side like in some other HP DV's and Toshiba Satellites, however one day I came home after class and while studying next to it, noticed that the mousepad was scorching hot. I figured, \"Hey, it's an HP!\" HOWEVER, just a few minutes later I go to browse the internet and notice the metal paint job on the left-hand cursor had BURNT OFF! This was only after around six months of use, and to this day nearly the entire left-hand cursor is burnt-black.*The graphics card: You wouldn't think it would be bad, and it's not that bad...BUT it is a very cheap, OLD graphics card and can cause computer games to skip around.*The INTERNET: I have LOST COUNT of how many times the internet on this computer has suddenly stopped working. You will be browsing the internet and WHAM! You will close the lid to your computer and come back to it and WHAM! No matter how or when it happens, this laptop will find a way to disconnect to the internet (another reason I should mention that I simply keep it in my apartment room). It is NOT easy to reconnect the internet when this happens. Especially if you do not have access to the router, it is basically trial-and-error each time this happens -- and it happens quite frequently and usually waste a few hours trying to fix it. For some reason there is no solution to this problem, because one method can fix the internet one time, and not work at all the next! ---The touchpad wifi control sometimes can mess up and stay on \"disconnected/orange\" even if you try and try and try to enable it and make it blue. This is NOT a portable laptop, because many times it doesn't even pick up wireless points many other laptops do!*The safety-rubber attached to the laptop IS ATTACHED WITH FREAKING ELMER'S GLUE!!! Okay, so maybe it's not...however, a few of the pieces of rubber placed on the very bottom and screen fall off. They literally will just melt off...You will feel something sticky and realize the rubber is melting off.*built-in microphone of poor quality. I didn't even REALIZE this laptop had a built in microphone like my mom's new mac, simply because...It doesn't pick up sound unless you have your mouth to the screen -- and how many people do that?!*CD-rom sometimes doesn't function -- you will insert a CD or DVD and be all stoked to listen or watch it when nothing pops up. You go to my computer>CD/DVD-drive to notice it hasn't picked up the fact you just put a cd or dvd in. Sometimes it says, \"NO DVD/CD INSERTED.\" and jot-fully pop out the CD/DVD door as if you really needed that lol So again, you should restart your computer...and get used to it if you buy this...Okay, I know i doesn't sound like alot, but trust me...these cons really get to you after a while, and I haven't even mentioned (although I think this happens to most HP's), all the things which stop working and error messages which randomly pop up.I know this is a very LONG review, but if it stops you from buying this laptop or at least lets you know what you are getting yourself into, then I'm happy.I WANT to like this computer, and put aside all of these issues...but I just can't. If this were a $300-$400 computer (the cost to fix my keyboard haha), then I might shrug it off as annoying as it is...but what ever happened to getting what you paid for?I do not recommend this laptop to anyone and the only reason this review is so long is because the problems-list associated with the laptop...goes on and on. :/","Date":"January 24, 2010"}

{"Title":"Not quite what we were hoping for...","Author":"Mac Tech \"Alan\"","ReviewID":"RFUD2GXROAALM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I work as an IT manager, overseeing about 4000+ client computers.  About one-fourth of them are Macs.  I myself am a long-time Mac user, currently using a dual-quad Mac Pro and a 1st gen white MacBook, which I love both of them.Full disclosure: I do not own this new MacBook (although I had planned to upgrade), but we bought several for evaluation purposes to determine whether they would be purchased in larger quantities.  I have used one for almost a week now and have developed a love / hate relationship with them.The Good:The unibody is a beautiful design, and makes for a rigid and solid feeling notebook.  I like the fact they've make it easier to perform hard drive and memory upgrades.  The battery indicator on the side is a nice touch, instead of on the bottom, but I admit, I never used it that much, since I tend to check the battery life when it's on and I check it on the menu bar.Once you get used to it, the new trackpad, it's a delight to use, and the new finger gestures are useful.  The new DisplayPort also seems to work well enough, although once again, new adapters will have to purchased.  Some people have complained about the lack of HDMI, but if you read the specs for the DisplayPort standard, it really takes us into the next generation of video display and is a better standard, IMHO.Finally, the new graphics update is much welcomed.  Graphics performance has substantially been increased, and the 2.0 GHz machines we're testing are pretty snappy when using graphics intensive tasks.  We don't play games with these, but I'm sure gamers will welcome the change.  Our Pro Apps are noticeably faster.The Bad:Naturally, this new manufacturing process has to cost Apple more, but we didn't except to pay so much more for a computer with worst [basic] specs than what we were getting in our purchase of the white and black MacBooks.  Except for graphics performance, our CPU benchmarks are very lackluster in comparison.  Our IT budget is very tight right now, and it's going to be hard to justify a purchase with so little difference in performance.  Respectively, each model, compared to the MacBook model it replaced, is only 6% and 12% faster.  These benchmarks have been independently verified by many Mac-related websites.Several of our early testers are complaining about the ultra-glossy (or glassy) screen and the quality of the display itself.  Our offices are brightly-lit and it takes quite a bit of adjustment to properly see the screen without severe glare.  This isn't as noticeable in low-light environments, but we also see poor side-to-side viewing, meaning you almost have to look at these dead-on straight to see a good image.  Comparing it to earlier MacBooks and MBP's, these new models are much worse.  Fingerprints are much more noticeable also, and the glass front bezel seems to be a fingerprint magnet.  That's not a big deal, but they complained that  calibration doesn't help the color flaws in this new display.  These use LED displays, as opposed to TFT displays that the previous MacBook had.  I think it's just a cheaper panel, because other reviews have had no major complaints with LED displays in the new MacBook Pros.Lastly, and most important to me as a technician, is the lack of a FireWire port.  Many of my peripherals are FW and also I frequently use the Target Disk Mode (TDM) in my job of diagnosing, repairing, saving and migrating data from other Macs.  Even though I had planned to upgrade, I now have no choice but to keep what I have.  Also, our Media department will not be getting upgrades.  They also use video and audio FW devices that cannot be substituted or re-purchased simply because Apple choose to leave FW out on this model.  Not only is cost an issue to go to a MacBook Pro, but many of us liked the smaller footprint of the 13\" model.I find it ironic that Apple increased the graphics performance to use their Pro Apps more effectively, but left out the very port that is used to import the video and audio files for those Pro Apps to work with?  Many of us would have even traded the ethernet port for the FW port, since you can get a USB to Ethernet dongle.Also, since our department uses cloning software to quickly install drive images for our clients, this will affect us dramatically.  USB, is not only much, MUCH slower, but less reliable.  You have to turn off any software that may execute during the clone.  In our tests, we found something as small as \"Little Snitch\" coming on during a clone install, is enough to choke a USB drive to almost stopping the clone process.  It's a much slower and more unreliable process.I know some people have stated that FW is dead, but no, it isn't.  It is continuing to be developed into a faster standard.  And USB-3 isn't a reality yet, so saying that USB-3 is coming anyway, doesn't do anyone any good at the present since only USB-2 ports exists on these models.  And yes, I realize some people have never heard of FW and to them, this is no big deal.  Although, part of the power, and reliability of a Mac, is the fact you can make an exact, bootable clone of your hard drive, and within minutes of a major hardware failure, be up and running, and continue to do your work, while your hard drive is being replaced.  This is a powerful feature that some people will never know until it's too late.  Granted, you can basically do the same from a USB drive, but if anyone has ever had to do so, they know how excruciatingly slow it is.  And of course USB cannot duplicate the functions of TDM.These new MacBooks will find buyers, there's no doubt that for many people they will be just what they need, and again, they are gorgeous and probably very durable.  But people that depended on FW and have an investment in FW devices, will need to think long and hard about this upgrade.  Also, I would recommend anyone wanting to purchase, to visit the Apple store and examine the LCD display for themselves.Although a minor complaint, I don't like the fact Apple makes you purchase the $1600 upgrade in order to get a lighted keyboard, that's as bad as the \"black\" tax (the black MacBooks costing more).  Using three stars as an \"average\" upgrade, I'm only giving this upgrade two stars because I feel Apple took too much away in relation for the price they are charging. This is unusual for me, since Apple products usually get my highest praise.  If this were a new product line, without anything to compare it to, perhaps it would be different.  But, the plastic MacBook continues to be the better deal for us at this point, although we will continue to evaluate them and see if perhaps Apple decides to release another revision with some improvements.1/31/09 Update:For those on a budget, and those who can live without the unibody design, but still wants / needs a MacBook, I encourage you to check out the newest refresh of the white MacBook.  They have made some substantial upgrades but have still kept the price down to what is, I think, a very affordable, but high-quality laptop from Apple.  We recently purchased ten of these and have been very happy with them.  The performance upgrade is very noticeable, and we can still use our FireWire peripherals and display adapters.  Since we are still using our original evaluation units together with our older models, we have also noticed better Wi-Fi reception on the polycarbonate models, as have other users.  But, in fairness, I will say, other than a couple of issues (mainly with DisplayPort adapters and the trackpad), the new MacBooks have performed well for us, and we have not had any major issues with them.You can find more info here:[...]Display update:5/29/09As I noted, the screen on the MacBook is just terrible.  It appears Apple has updated the MacBook's display because of complaints.From ARS:  \"Apple looks to have quietly replaced the LCD screen it was using on the unibody MacBook with an improved part. The updated screens began showing up in MacBooks made since the end of April, according to a report from Computerworld.\"June 8th 09 update:  In spite of those who criticized my review for my opinion on Firewire and the display.  Today, WWDC announced the MacBook PRO 13\", which replaces this model.  It has the better display, same type as used in the 15\", AND, now includes Firewire 800.  With even more features, and at a cheaper price, we'll be purchasing some for evaluation, and I think it's now time for me to upgrade from my 1st Gen White Macbook that has served me very well.  I hope to write a new review on this much needed upgrade.","Date":"October 29, 2008"}
{"Title":"Very Poor Display (Beware)","Author":"Charles","ReviewID":"R2DXQ1LC3XO4XV","Overall":"bad","Content":"I just got my new Aluminum MacBook last night, and it's going right back for refund this morning. The LCD is far inferior to my 1st generation MacBook display, and it's actually one of the worst displays I've seen on a modern notebook computer. I've been an Apple owner since I bought an SE/30, but Apple has screwed up badly here, and I find the new MacBook nearly unusable. (Please note, my current MacBook has a glossy screen; that level of glossiness is not the issue here.)UPDATE: I just got back from the Apple Store (refund accomplished), and one of the staff at the store (a photographer) helped me compare my old MacBook with this new Aluminum MacBook and the new MacBook Pro. All of the new MacBooks on display had the same issues: blacks not really black, colors less vibrant, and overall contrast lower than the old MacBook. The new MacBook Pro, however, does not have these issues (although the screen is still a bit more blue than the old MacBook; not as blue as new MacBook). The Apple Store staffer agreed that the new MacBook screen is not great. He also much preferred the old one (or the new MacBook Pro). An online review at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review) clearly shows the same problems that I describe here.The issues:1. The whole screen has an icky blue cast, and nothing in the display calibration settings will fix this (I tried for over an hour). My old MacBook has a much more pure and natural looking white. I think Apple needs to work more on the LED back-lighting for the new MacBook (or maybe they cheaped out on the MacBook LEDs).2. The blacks on the new display are washed out (this used to be a problem with LCD televisions and can still occur with cheap LCDs). This is obvious on the start-up animation (with the multi-lingual \"welcome\" messages against the Leopard nebulae in space). It's not just an issue with solid black images, however: this propagates to everything looking less crisp. And it's not an issue of adjusting brightness or screen angle. In fact, if you try to adjust the screen angle to get some reasonably good blacks, you get parts of the screen where you have a metallic or posterized effect. I saw this in the store displays as well, but I didn't realize that it would occur under normal viewing angles vs. extreme situations. This is also clearly shown in the gizmodo review referenced above.3. Colors are not vibrant (nothing compared to my 1st generation MacBook). By not vibrant, I mean that different hues of blue, for example, are not distinct from one another. When I open Word, the splash screen has four different blue colors in the \"feather\" shape at the top right. On the old MacBook the blues are distinctly different and colorful, on the new MacBook they are much closer in hue and more dull. I think this is a result primarily of issues one and two above, but it may also have to do with other aspects of the inferior LCD on the Aluminum MacBook.4. The new MacBook screen should be called \"mirrored\" not \"glossy\". My 1st generation MacBook has a glossy screen. It's good. I rarely have an issue with visible reflections from it. The new MacBook is a constant battle. One major problem is that the screen needs to be pushed farther back to get reasonable contrast, but this angle directly reflects ceiling lights at the user. It's also so significantly more reflective than the previous glossy screen that it picks up windows and floor lamps and everything else a lot more easily. It's a mess.I hope this helps other folks avoid my mistake in seeking to upgrade from an existing MacBook. The new one does not feel any faster in day to day use (3D rendering excepted), and it has crippling issues with the display. I would strongly encourage anyone with a current MacBook to take it to the store with you and check out the Aluminum MacBook display for yourself before buying.","Date":"October 18, 2008"}
{"Title":"20% more expensive, marginal performance gains","Author":"Nate \"bigetan\"","ReviewID":"R12G18TZMWXR02","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am an apple fan and enjoy using the macbook but I just cannot recommend this laptop at the moment to others based on what you are getting for your money.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, then you should unfortunately look elsewhere.  In the midst of economic trouble apple has decided to increase the cost of their new entry level aluminum macbooks by 20% over early 2008s models with marginal performance gains from the additional front side bus.Pros-new trackpad has cool factor (although buggy)-new graphic card has made this a decent gaming platform-design is smooth and polishedCons- Overall performance based on price has decreased.  Now instead of getting a 2.4Ghz dual core for $1300 you must shell out an additional $300 @ $1600 to acquire this performance. If you checkout macworld's benchmarks the performance gained over the additional FSB is marginal at best.  The only gains come in frames per second during game testing.- graphics card is nice but most ppl are not even into hardcore computer gaming and the macbook use to be a nice alternative to the pro models hefty price tag for us non gamers....wish this could have been an option.-160GB or 250GB hard drive with only 5400rps!  At these price points I expected at the minimum 7200rps.  I know this can be manually changed, but who wants to shell even more money after buy such an expensive laptop.Overall this computer performs well but the price is even becoming to high for some of us apple fans.  The macbooks have always been a top of the line luxury laptop but now they are widening that gap even further with design not performance fueling the price increases.  My recommendation is to wait at this time b/c come mid 2009 the prices will hopefully fall and Apple's new and improved SnowLeopard OS will be out.  With Steve Jobs you never buy the first iteration of a new product, unless you are willing to pay top dollar for something that will decrease in price by 20% in 6months.","Date":"October 22, 2008"}

The problem started in the fourth month of use when the computer started shutting down for no reason. The pro I have freezes and has trouble running programs. When you talk to apple about it, after three months have past, they will not help. This is a change from my previous experiences with apple. Now, after only two years my computer randomly turns off and will not turn on again without spending two hours trying to get it to work. It is time for me to look for another company that was as good as apple was ten years ago. I don't think the pro is worth the money since the service has gotten so bad, so if you buy it you also need to purchase apple care to take care a computer that, at least in my case, has had nothing but problems and they are not willing to help. They may still be the best option among bad options, but I for one am looking elsewhere. No one should have to buy a new computer every two years!","Date":"September 24, 2013"}

{"Title":"Cheap Screen, No Firewire, $1300. Huh?","Author":"Chrissy Goddick","ReviewID":"RVNAXB5OEQ3J6","Overall":"bad","Content":"I don't know what Apple is doing these days. They go on and on about how great the new one-piece machined 'unibody' construction is on these new Macbooks, but then they go and mess up on some really important basics.1) No Firewire- Hey, this is an APPLE technology. They created it, and supported it for years. Lots of people used it, lots of people loved it. Now, all of a sudden, it's GONE from the Macbook line, except for one old plastic model that isn't going to be around much longer. Why? So if you need it, you can go shell out $2000 for a Macbook Pro? Just not a great way to treat your customers, particularly long-time ones.2) Trackpad issues - Hey, the new trackpad is bigger and all-glass. Cool. There's no button anymore, the trackpad is the button now. Cool, I guess. Some of these new trackpads don't always work right... they don't always register clicks, the cursor sometimes moves with a life of its own, making it very hard to select menu items, and other bits o' random weirdness. Not cool.Apple says they're going to fix it soon with a software or firmware update. I sure hope so. Because if they can't and it's actually a physical/hardware issue to any significant extent, then we're talking either a massive notebook recall (very inconvenient for affected users), or Apple basically nicely telling us \"it's not that bad\"/suck it.If the latter, you could be stuck with a way-less-than-optimal trackpad, if Apple were to deem this problem not grounds for a return/replacement. Well, depending on how the inevitable consumer lawsuits would shake out, of course. But that would take awhile.So again, if you're one of the ones who got a glitchy trackpad, best hope the upcoming update fixes it. I have some faith in Apple that it will, at least mostly.3) El cheapo screen- The Macbook screen is, to put it nicely, not great. Now, the backlighting is good, much brighter than the old Macbooks. But the screen itself? SUPER-glossy. Apple likes this because it makes the colors 'pop' a bit more, but the price for this is that you get tons of very distracting, annoying reflections [you can use it as a makeup mirror] and oodles of very noticeable smudges, smears, and fingerprints.Also not a fan of the big, space-gobbling black bezel. It increases the footprint while making the small (aka 'barely adequate') 13.3\" screen look even smaller. Check out the previous gen Macbook Pro to see what an appropriately-sized bezel looks like.More importantly though, the viewing angle on the Macbook screen is TINY. Images can look good if your head is positioned PERFECTLY, but move just a bit right or left, or (especially) up or down, and the image goes to heck. If you think that that's \"just the way LCDs are\", compare the Macbook screen to the screen on the MB Pro or even Macbook Air-- neither of those is nearly as 'touchy' in terms of viewing angle as the MB's is, and have much larger 'sweet spots'.Another bit of Macbook screen wackiness is that you have to tilt the screen WAAAY back, almost to horizontal, or blacks will appear washed out. But do that, and you catch ALL the reflections, in glorious super-glossy detail, from any and all overhead lighting. Darned if you do, darned if you don't.Bottom line, the MacBook uses a cheap screen made to seem higher-quality than it really is by super-glossy glass and a very bright backlight. Clever, but not cool. Apple doesn't seem to have really thought through the drawbacks here. Or perhaps they did but didn't care, since they were saving so much $$$ on the screen.4) Speakers - If you love music (and who doesn't?) you're going to be disappointed here. These are some pretty muddy-sounding and quite volume-limited built-in speakers, even by notebook standards. And no, not everyone digs using headphones all the time, or lugging add-on speakers everywhere. The whole idea of a notebook is easy, all-in-one portability.\"Well, whaddya expect for $1300?!\", some might say, inadvertently revealing just how out-of-touch some of us Mac fans can be. Alls I can say is, my friend's ancient (and lots cheaper) iBook sounds better. This is the company that gave us the iPod? Is music a priority or not?5) No card reader, and no internal 3G option - Disappointing, and annoying. Apple's way too in love with minimalism. Enough said.6) Specs - Not great, particularly for the money... little 'bump' over the previous gen. At least the graphics chip is significantly improved, though that was a low bar to pass (the previous gen's Intel integrated graphics were very weak).7) Price - $1300 is a lot for a notebook, especially with the economy heading south.  Apple won't give you any options at all for a 15\" screen or expansion slots even in the high-end part of the Macbook line, which is pretty obnoxious already (again, they want you to cough up the $2000 for the MB Pro). But to ask these prices AND not offer those things AND take away Firewire AND cheap out on the screen (among some other things)??Wowzers. Guess all the money went into the unibody construction.Which makes sense- even Apple has said that the unibody process will be very expensive at first, with its cost dropping over time. If you're acquainted with the previous generation Macbook, you can sort of understand Apple's obsession with the unibody, as the most serious complaints with the previous gen (plastic) MBs were in the areas of poor build-quality and questionable durability. Apple's trying hard to fix that, to their credit. Well that, and I think it strongly appeals to Steve Jobs' well-known aesthetic sensibilities.Jobs (whose health I hope improves) is fairly obsessed with his products having a Jaguar/Mercedes Benz-like 'high end' look and feel.  While that sure sounds cool, it isn't, always. Not when it, plus the build-quality mistakes made with the previous gen, cause Apple to focus obsessively-compulsively on a couple of areas while messing up/cheaping out in so many others.For $1300, the consumer/prosumer rightly expects a great ALL-AROUND notebook. If you look past the surface, this isn't it.On a more hopeful note, with unibody costs dropping, the NEXT Macbook revision may have the budget for a better screen and other improvements, perhaps even better pricing too (yeah I know, good luck). THAT MB could be the great all-arounder so many are looking/hoping for.But even if that happens, the Macbook line will still retain at least one serious flaw going forward, as it's highly doubtful that Apple will reverse its very poor decision to dump Firewire. That's a choice which will continue to screw the hobbyist/video-audio enthusiast crowd, a group that was particularly Mac-loyal (though maybe not as much anymore).Despite the Macbook's drawbacks, don't get me wrong- the new MBs have their strengths: nice looks, should be quite durable, improved graphics card, the included i-Apps are useful and intuitive (as always), OS X is more secure than Windows, et cetera et cetera.  But, it's just not a good value for the money, particularly considering the minuses.Apple really, REALLY needs to listen to its customers more. I'm sure they think they're listening, but something's off there, as the result -this product- doesn't really seem to reflect that, at least not in any balanced way. Lately, it's like they've been building things more to please themselves, and not us.Normally I love Apple, but I'd think long and hard before buying this one.","Date":"November 5, 2008"}

{"Title":"Poor quality LCD","Author":"Hongyu Chi","ReviewID":"R14AHXWH7IVR5W","Overall":"bad","Content":"I know the LCD of the new Macbook is not very good, but I didn't expect that it is is that bad. It is not on par with quite some other laptops on the market with much lower price tags.1. The black and contrast level very poor, comparing side by side with another laptop, the darkest black you can get is a dark gray.2. The viewing angle is extremely narrow. I am NOT as picky as to use a laptop while walking around, just move my head a little bit produces noticeable artifacts.So when viewing or watching dark toned pictures or videos, ink patches like effect is very obvious, though for more vibrant colored scenes like the factory supplied background pictures and the ones showing in Apple store, with the help of the bright LED backlight and glossy coating, it does not seem to be that bad.The new Macbook is definitely trendy and tremendously good looking as a successful consumer electronic, but the poor quality display will surely diminish its usefulness as any slightly serious tool for photo and video processing, which ironically boasted as the Mac's appeal all along.On the bright side, the Mac OS is very responsive and quick comparing to Windows Vista, thought you may find that the system settings configurable with the UI interface is limited to make the system less complex. One thing I found missing is that you can not change to use larger fonts at system level, it might be hard to read some texts.","Date":"December 16, 2008"}

One is asynchronous, like USB which suffers from latency, bus contention and collisions.The other is isochronous mode, and it lets a device carve out a certain dedicated amount of bandwidth that other devices can't touch. It gets a certain number of time slices each second all its own. The advantages for audio/video should be obvious: that stream of data can just keep on flowing, and as long as there isn't more bandwidth demand than the wire can handle, nothing will interfere with it. No collisions, no glitches. Firewire is Rock Solid.There are no USB to Firewire adapters. (Desperate aluminum Macbook owners are looking, but it can't be done.)The Macbook Pro has Firewire, but many don't want a 15\" Macbook Pro, because of the large size. They want something more portable.The aluminum MacBook has no slot for an Express Card. There's NO WAY to connect any Firewire device to the new MacBooks...period.Keep in mind that when Apple dropped ADB, SCSI and floppy drives in the Mac at least there where alternatives. USB floppy drives and usb to ABD adapters that protected your investment. There is NO option to connect existing or future Firewire products to the new aluminum Macbook.It will be interesting to see what happens in the first revision of the new MacBooks. The original MacBook Pros didn't have Firewire 800, but Firewire 800 was added in the first revision after many complaints.Firewire is continuing to improve. (Firewire 3200 will be out soon.) Firewire is more relevant than it ever has been.Most would be better off with the White MacBook (that comes with Firewire). They're slightly faster and cheaper than the low end aluminum Macbook.

It's almost impossible to not be distracted by reflections when working with it, which causes eye-strain, fatigue, and maybe more serious ocular problems.

{"Title":"$1600, Yet No FireWire?","Author":"Your Role Model","ReviewID":"R1DGWEZXG3WN8V","Overall":"bad","Content":"In a few ways, the new metal MacBooks are actually an improvement over the last-gen MBs... aluminum is nicer-looking (IMO) than the previous white plastic, there's a more solid-feeling keyboard, new LED-backlighting on an all-glass screen (highly glossy though- reflection-and-fingerprint-city), new multitouch gesturing (like the iPhone) on a new all-glass trackpad that IS the button now (the whole trackpad 'clicks'- some will like this, some won't), and somewhat better graphics performance (though still far from hardcore gamer standards).But Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the high price point. Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and various Firewire-to-whatever adapters or hubs, present or future, are not solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can.These folks are now stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000 & up), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Book model, still around at $1000, with FireWire- though these will likely be discontinued pretty soon.The screen is also a bit disappointing, with a very limited viewing angle and far-from-the-best blacks and contrast.Bottom line: It's a quite pretty new MacBook with some nice minor upgrades and clever touches, but a less-than-great screen and one huge downgrade that didn't need to happen. Also, at $1600, it's quite expensive, even for the MacBook line.If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's certainly fine. But, isn't much of the reason why MacBooks are WORTH the price premium the fact that you can do darn near ANYTHING with 'em? Not anymore.Prosumers will be especially disappointed, as Apple is expecting them to shell out quite a lot of money for a notebook that doesn't really support what they want to do anymore.","Date":"October 21, 2008"}

It has no firewire power which is really stupid.  Even a $500 Dell has that.  The previous Macbook had it.  My friends already has 2 stains on his palm rest which will not come out.I can't recommend this computer to anyone and that is sad because I'm a big fan of Apple products and have 2 other computers by them.  I have a black Macbook and a iMac.  I'm returning this to Apple and will just use my black Macbook which is better in my opinion anyways.Apple quality has taken some strong hits lately.  They are devoted to building iPods and iPhones and have forgotten about their computer line.  Very disappointing.","Date":"October 21, 2008"}
{"Title":"MacBook makes MSBloat look good","Author":"TypicalUser","ReviewID":"R3M3A35NG3C1BF","Overall":"bad","Content":"After years of pent-up frustration with the bureaucratic, non-intuitive, user-hostile functioning of PCs, Windows, and Microsoft Bloatware, I was really looking forward to my switch over to MacWorld.  I bought a 13.3\" Macbook upgraded with the best available processing and memory.  Right out of the box, the thing looked beautiful and sleek.  I switched it on and that's where the fun stopped.  The MacBook and OS Leopard make Microsoft products seem efficient, intuitive, and logical by comparison. I've had mine a month now, and I'm a reasonably intelligent person, so it is fair to say I've given it all the chance an average person should.  I look forward to using it as a $2K aluminum frisbee very soon.  Examples:I recently spent a 4-hour cross-country flight trying to get the word processor to let me expand the default working window from 5\" to a more full=screen adult size.  But you can't do that.  Apparently MacApple also doesn't want you to be able to re-name files, or move them around among folders.  Even deleting them is not a one-key process, you have to drag them here, drag them there, play miniature golf with them, just to get them in the \"trash.\"But backing up a couple of weeks; right out of the box, most programs started out with some kind of error message.  \"Hold on there, you can't do that, who do you think you are\"  So I had to burrow dep into the settings and preferences to try to reset things to get Garage Band, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes etc, to run at the basic level.  And oh by the way, all \"Help\" menus are online, so you must be connected to the internet to use them.  That's a problem when your problem is that the MacBook won't connect to the internet.  So there went another weekend for me,  wandering through settings and preferences in weirdly arranged menus, trying to set the computer to the most obvious basic settings to get it online.  What sold me on Macs was the reputation that everything about them is \"plug and play.\"  My experience is that almost nothing is.Now it won't let me send emails while I'm on the road.And the trackpad is going bad, after 4 weeks of service.When the CD drive ejects a disc, it sounds like somebody folding a CD jewel case in their hands until it snaps into pieces.  I sense big trouble in there soon.So: I spent big money experimenting with the switch from PC to Mac.  I used to keep a Bill Gates Voodo doll on my desk, sticking pins in it everytime I ran into some typical PC dysfuncion.  But now Apple has made me a big fan of PCs.  I'll be going back.The backlit keyboard is nice, and the glossy screen is not the problem other reviewers suggest.  The real problems with this product are not those superficial things.  The real problems are inside.Run, do not walk, away rom this product.","Date":"May 9, 2009"}

{"Title":"No FireWire Makes the new 'MetalBook' a Mixed Bag...","Author":"Your Role Model","ReviewID":"R1HM46KG83BB2H","Overall":"bad","Content":"Well gosh, where to begin...In a few ways, the new aluminum MacBooks ('MetalBooks') are actually an improvement... the aluminum is IMO nicer-looking than the previous white plastic, there's a slightly more solid-feeling keyboard, a new LED-backlit glass (not plastic) screen, the trackpad now lets you use multitouch gestures (like the iPhone) for a few common functions, the whole trackpad is one big button now (some may dig that, some might not), and there's somewhat better graphics performance too (though still far from hardcore gamer standards).Sounds pretty nice, right? But somehow, in a VERY puzzling decision, Apple managed to give with one hand and take away with the other, by eliminating FireWire from the new MetalBooks.Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and very unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the $1300 point (medium for *Apple*, but high for Windows switchers, who are about 50% of Apple's clientele these days).Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with expensive Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and Firewire-to-whatever adapters/hubs are not real solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can.These folks are stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000+), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Books, still around at $1000 with FireWire (though probably not for much longer).Some ppl will also dislike the lack of a matte screen option- while it's nice that the screen is now LED-backlit and made of glass, it's also verrry glossy now, with all the annoying glare and fingerprints that that entails. Also, the viewing angle is surprisingly narrow, and the screen doesn't have very good blacks or contrast, which is disappointing for a laptop in this price range.All in all, this is a quite pretty MacBook with some clever touches/minor upgrades, but one huge downgrade that did not need to happen, plus a less-than-stellar screen.If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's fine. But, isn't much of the reason why MacBooks are WORTH the price premium the fact that you can do darn near ANYTHING with 'em? Not anymore.At $1300, most 'prosumers' will be expecting a notebook that's a 'win-win', not a 'win-lose'. Sadly, that is what the new MetalBooks ultimately are.Why Apple, why?  =[[Edit:] Also be aware that many users are noting problems with the new Macbook and MB Pro trackpads, such as not all clicks registering, the cursor repeatedly leaping off of selected items, etc.  Apple is now aware of this and is saying that a software fix is on the way, but it remains to be seen how effective it'll be. Another reason to wait, I guess.","Date":"October 21, 2008"}

A few months later the computer kept shutting down.  Here the motherboard was running so hot, it shut itself down so the motherboard would not fry.  Upon inspecting the machine, the fan vent is on the bottom.  A not-so-bright design if I may say so.  My fix is to use it on a cookie cooling rack.  So now, wherever my 'portable' laptop goes, the cookie rack follows.A few months after that, the cursor would jump around whenever I typed with my palms resing next to the mouse pad.

{"Title":"HP Pavilion DV5-1003nr: A Nightmare without Support","Author":"David M. Dickerson","ReviewID":"RPSMBUH4V6COC","Overall":"bad","Content":"PRODUCT STATUS: Although HP still makes some Pavilion DV-5-series notebooks, the DV5-1003nr is discontinued in late 2008/early 2009. (If you are interested in this notebook, you should find excellent pricing on this particular model, because it is no longer being manufactured, but is a recent product and updates for drivers, firmware, and software are still available from Hewlett-Packard's Web site.In August 2008, I received a new HP Pavilion DV5-1003NR notebook as an unexpected gift. I had been looking for a factory-refurbished IBM ThinkPad, two to four years old, with not operating system installed, because I planned to run Linux on the notebook. ThinkPads have become a favorite of Linux users because of their compatibility, durability, and reliability -- and I personal find that widescreen displays (which seem to be the norm for standalone and notebook/laptop displays) adversely hinder my productivity, because the work that I do makes vertical screen space more valuable than extra width.My DV5-1003nr notebook (officially an \"HP Pavilion DV5 Entertainment Notebook PC\") came with 4-GB of RAM, 1-GB more than the default, although the unit preshipped with a 32-bit, OEM version of Vista Home Premium SP1 (which cannot take advantage of 4-GB of RAM); a retail, boxed 32-bit Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate Upgrade (which was over $200 at the time, but was purchased because the Best Buy salesperson told \"my benefactor\" that Vista Ultimate make full use of the 4-GB of RAM (which, of course, is not true of the 32-bit version -- but was the reason for the purchased of a 2-GB SoDIMM to replace the 1-GB soDIMM occupying one of the two memory slots) and stated that HP \"should have no problem with the upgrade\" and that, if the notebook was purchased with Best Buy's 2-year extended protection plan (which it was) that the upgrade from HP's OEM version of Vista Home Premium (without installation or recovery discs) to a Vista Ultimate was compatible with the extended service plan.NOTE: My particular unit was assembled in Chine in May 2008 with a defective AMD processor. The notebook could not load Windows Vista the first time that I turned it on (which should have been a red flag to return the unit immediately for an exchange or, ideally, a refund). Because the computer was new, I had to keep refusing the Startup Repair option to select a recent restore point (and I was not offered the recovery option, presumably because Vista had not yet loaded and had not yet added the recovery partition as a boot option): After an hour, Vista loaded, but a growing barrage of errors and lockups started. I created two recovery DVDs on Maxell's best DVR-R data discs as soon I as was prompted to do so during the setup process. (This process took several hours.) I tried using the recovery partition and the recovery DVDs that I used to restore the computer to factory condition, but was trapped in an endless cycle -- and HP support totally ignored my support requests for three months. Because I have built all of my computers myself (except for the Macs), I kept trying to resolve the cascading problems myself, out of habit, but realized that I should used Best Buy's 2-year extended protection plan.A technician from the Geek Squad at the store where the notebook was purchased called me two days after I dropped off the computer, stating that the HP had built the notebook with a defective CPU, and that he'd seen symptoms of \"motherboard issues\" before the diagnostic software and computer crashed. I approved shipping the computer to a service center for repair, and the technician told me that he expected the motherboard with the CPU would be replaced. When the notebook arrived back at the store in three weeks, I was upset to learn that the hardware was not mentioned  in the report (except in the condition comments, which stated that the unit showed no signs of wear or abuse) and that no repairs were performed: Vista was reinstalled because of \"one missing and one corrupt system file, but all is well now.\" The extended coverage has a \"no lemons\" clause, but Best Buy will replace a computer only after \"four valid repairs,\" and installations are not considered repairs. I have not yet found a way to escape this trap.I contacted HP CEO Mark Hurd about my lack of support and was assigned a case manager who was was less than helpful and subjected me to verbal abuse and insults every time that I called him (and he never called me). My notebook came with a single-fan cooling mat, which I recommend for all notebook and laptop computer users, and I had always used it. My first unit had a tilt feature and I put the notebook in my lap for two seconds to adjust the tilt. During that time I jumped in as a reflex to an intense burning sensation, although I managed to catch the notebook before it hit the floor. The redness and pain (through thick denim jeans) last for three days. During a conversation with my HP case manager, I had mentioned my concerns about the heat and that the CPU typically runs at 70-72 degrees Celsius (roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit or more) and he laughed and said, \"they do run hot, don't they!?\" -- and he evaded my query of how he could help me resolve the problem. I then described my injury and my HP case manager told me that the burn was MY responsibility, because \"HP actually makes a distinction between a laptop and a notebook computer; you put a notebook in your lap, and a notebook is NOT a laptop.\" My case manager became irate when I stated that his job was to resolve my problems, per Mark Hurd's wishes, not entangle me in semantics -- and he started to rant and was unintelligible, so I quietly hung up the phone.I have contacted Geek Squad's CI, Robert Stephens, whom I hope can intervene, but -- after two more messages to Mark Hurd's office -- I missed a phone call from someone in the HP executive department, but -- based upon HP's ever-dropping service ratings (and the fact that I returned a new scanner that died after three months and received a filthy refurbished unit with felt pen marks scrawled around the control buttons) -- I am hoping that Robert Stephens can end this message, but I also have 30 days before my HP warranty expires (which I have honored, not installing the Vista Ultimate upgrade because I was told it would instantly void my warranty), and if Robert Stephens does not contact me soon, I must contact HP, although I have been deceived, ignored, and fully expect HP to allow the warranty to expire.PRODUCT OVERVIEW: Hewlett-Packard's series of wide-screen, shiny metallic and black, entertainment series of notebook computers is not intended for business use (for which its design is not intended or suited). I would describe the HP Pavillion DV5 series as \"a portable DVD player for people who do casual computing for short periods of time.\"The plastic (silver or bronze, depending on one's model) keys are so reflective that I struggle to see the characters. If I start typing \"gibberish\" and need to reposition my hands in the correct touch-typing position, the process strains my eyes and wastes time. The Synaptics TouchPad (which is actually metal) is difficult to customize and the two buttons require undue pressure and are very loud. (I recall thinking that I broke the switches several times.) The screen may be popular with people who view DVDs on the computer, but the reflective, glass-like surface generates glare that literally gives me double- and triple-vision and causes my eyes to burn. Focusing has become a problem even when I am not using the notebook's display, and I actually visited my ophthalmologist four months after getting this notebook, convinced that I needed a new eyeglass prescription. (I also use an external keyboard and mouse, although I cannot afford an external monitor.)If you decide to purchase a Pavilion DV5-1003NR, make certain that you purchase a new unit with a full warranty. Based upon my Web searches, and the growing number of Web sites such as HPLies.com, I suggest that you purchase a third-party, extended service plan from a trusted provider at the same time that you purchase any HP computer -- although my experience with HP, sadly, is not unique, and I suggest that you do not purchase any HP desktop, laptop, or notebook computers -- or any product that might require support.Consumer Reports and other independent organizations have published comparisons of OEM computer manufacturers, based upon quality of product and quality of service and support. I \"shot myself in the proverbial foot,\" because I was so used to building and troubleshooting my own computers. I suspect that bare-bones laptop and notebook computers and/or kits will be available in the future, but most computer users prefer to purchase a computer that works and for which they can get friendly and prompt, responsive service.Finally, even if my particular unit were not built with a defective CPU, overheating is a problem that is plaguing HP notebooks -- Intel and AMD -- beyond the models that have had recalled batteries, which were the causes of the overheating. Heat and dust will always be enemies of computers, but small, powerful computers -- and many people use laptop computers as their only computer -- lack the space for air to flow or additional fans that help cold desktop computers. (Of course, additional fans are not a viable cooling option for notebook computers, because of their adverse effect on battery life.)I am sure that my serious hardware defect is an exception, although it is my first (and last) experience with AMD processors, but Hewlett-Packard has a verifiable record of poor quality, poor or nonexistent support, and the deception and abusive treatment of customers that I have experienced.'Caveat emptor'!Cordially,DavidP.S. -- Like many reviewers, I would like to give this product and HP a rating of zero stars, but one star is the minimum rating that I can give! :-)","Date":"July 1, 2009"}

First, the keyboard location/palm rest space is non-ergnonimic and will lead to wrist pain for anyone with medium to large palms. With mouse pad and related related clickable fields taking extra space, loudspeakers on the top taking space, there is not enough space to rest your palms - they end up resting on the edges and slipping off - putting pressure on your wrist area. This can lead to Carpal tunnel syndrom. Second, the location or finger reader is awkward - just under where you keep your hands instead on the side. Thrid, the weight of above 6lbs speaks against T500.

If I could find the decision makers for this laptop and the fine Microsoft persons who gave the green light to Vista, I would skin them alive and then dip them in vinegar to make up for one tenth of the frustration I've had with this computer.When I restart, the computer has always gone into an endless boot where it looks to start with the hard drive, then goes to the DVD play... and back... and forth... and back... and forth... Enough said there.  The laptop is massively overpowered by that dirty diaper full of programming called Vista.  It is a 64 bit version, so realize when you buy it that A LOT OF YOUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN ON 64 bit Vista.  As a result of this purchase (here, we step into the Vista diaper deeper), I had to purchase a new printer, a new version of AutoCAD, a new version of Norton Ghost (which eventually won't run anyways), a new portable scanner... and the list goes on and on. My fine new $800 laptop cost me an extra several thousand dollars to run with modified soft/hardware.  You would think that Toshiba would have been prepared for this kind of problem.  Eventually, I paid a kid to swipe the toilet clean ... I mean the laptop, and replace it with Windows 7.  While this does seem to have solved some problems, the laptop is still underpowered.And Toshiba, thanks for putting a Labelflash drive in it.  Unfortunately, although it does a great job, companies like Toshiba never supported it as well as it should have been supported and Labelflash has turned this into the Beta (of VHS versus Beta fame) when compared to Lightscribe.  Again, I like Labelflash BETTER than Lightscribe, so don't get me wrong about that.  It's just that Labelflash is going bye-bye.  BEWARE - Finding Labelflash DVDs is getting tougher and will get expensive.  It does a great job, but the market has collapsed for them...Maybe I got a lemon?  I can't say for sure, but I can say that Toshiba should be ashamed of putting out such a piece of junk.  Microsoft should be ashamed... well, for the last 10 years of garbage they've put out.  I hope you have better luck than I did if you get this 'device'.Skip this machine and look elsewhere and make sure that you never buy a laptop/computer with a dirty diaper (Vista) installed.-M-PS - Strong letter to follow.","Date":"January 3, 2011"}

Not fantastic, but I didn't have any major problems with it. Then the fan started to make a ridiculously loud noise. I go online, find out it's a known issue, called Sony, and had them come fix it for free. No problem. Then the screen starts flickering and showing horizontal lines across the bottom, which gradually gets worse until the screen is basically unusable. I go online, and find out that this is also a known issue, which Sony offers a five-year extended warranty for. After sending it in to Sony, they now refuse to fix it because of what they claim is corrosion due to liquid damage. To my knowledge, no liquid damage had been done to the laptop, so I asked for pictures. The pictures they provided are nothing but dirt and cosmetic damage, which is going to happen with a 3-4 year old laptop. Last time I checked, being dirty did not void your warranty. None of the so-called \"damage\" has anything to do with the issue at hand, which is the fact that Sony produced a laptop that eventually begins to have problems with flickering in the screen. They KNOW they produced a laptop with this issue, yet they refuse to fix it. I have been around the bend several times with Sony customer service, and this whole experience has turned me from a loyal, dedicated Sony fan to someone who will never buy a Sony product again.To summarize: Sony refuses to stand by their products, even for problems that they acknowledge are their fault.

The appearance is perfect; however, the quality is poor.  Approximately two months after purchasing, my screen would randomly turn black and my computer wouldn't turn back on.

Recently, I took my laptop back to the Geek Squad at Best Buy to tell them about the terribly loud noises that it makes.  They kept my laptop for a week, then said that they heard the \"jet engine sound\" it was making, but that it was normal.  I'm sorry, but if my roommate can hear my computer roaring from across the room then it shouldn't be normal.  The noises are incredibly annoying and I find it hard to concentrate on what I'm doing...also, I have to restart often.  I definitely would not recommend this computer.

Approximately 8 months into it, the hinge system started falling apart on the left hand side.  I entered into a chat session with customer service.  They sent a box to pack the computer in to send in for repairs under the warranty.  I received a call from a case manager who accused me of dropping the laptop and said that \"even if what I said were the truth\" and it wasn't dropped, it wouldn't be covered anyway because it would be considered normal wear and tear.  He wanted over $400 to repair the computer.  I told him to just send it back to me.  Upon receiving it, my lcd screen is now broken.  Believe it or not, they will not accept any responsibility for the damage to my computer.  2 out of 3 of the customer service reps I spoke with in the repair division were incredibly rude.  I am not an engineer but even I know that this is a design flaw.  The lcd screen is just too heavy for the hinge system to survive over a very long period of time with even minimal use.  I couldn't be any more disappointed in a company.  They will not take responsbility for their own faulty product.  In my case, to make an even bad situation worse, they caused further damage and won't even make any effort to correct the problem.  I will never, ever buy another product from HP.","Date":"March 5, 2010"}

Vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.  When I sent it back to HP for my warranty they said the damage was my fault and would cost me $435.00 dollars to fix.  By looking at other web posts I have found out that this is the standard response to anything you want fixed by your warranty.  If you buy an HP just remember your warranty is worthless.  If you notice when you open this laptop the LCD screen is very flimsy.  This seems to be a terrible engineering design.  Maybe this is what led to the LCD screen going bad.  It appears to me that the LCD could easily be damaged under normal use which happened evidently to me.  The reason HP computers cost less than other brands is because they evidently don't have to support there warrranty or pay much for there engineering.","Date":"July 7, 2009"}

{"Title":"$50 plus labor to replace a fan that lasted less than 6 months","Author":"Jon Chadwell","ReviewID":"RX0VLG2RBZ6KG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this laptop for my wife a few years ago as a spur of the moment late anniversary gift purchase.  Within 3 months, the fan started squealing intermittently.  By 6 months, it squeals non stop so she pretty much stopped using the laptop.  It was unbearable to listen to.  Being lazy, I forgot about it until she was wanting to use the laptop again months later (we have a family desktop and I was probably using it).  By then our warranty was out and I checked into a new fan.  $50 for a fan!  Being that I built my own desktop, I figured I could change it myself.  Everything must come apart before the fan goes in.  I took it apart with much difficulty, and just think that I'd be better off buying her a new laptop.  As complicated as it is, I don't want to waste the $50 should I have destroyed the laptop while trying to get to the fan.  I write this review now, because I'm beginning to search for a replacement laptop.  I think it will be a long long time until I buy another HP product.

{"Title":"HP Pavilion dv1260us w/ 17\" Screen","Author":"Dr. Miles","ReviewID":"R2MOOYRQYAW02L","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had my HP Pavilion dv1260us for 7 months now.  At first, I was totally jazzed by the unit - a great 17\" screen, which I love, along with many other great features.  It was fast and worked great.  But then, after 5 or 6 months of fairly heavy use, I began having problems.Before I get into those, let me say that I took very good care of the laptop - using it only at home - not taking it anywhere or abusing it in any way.  (Due to severe space constraints, I choose to use a laptop rather than a desktop computer.)  Since I use an added wireless keyboard, I do not have an issue with the laptop's keyboard as expressed in other comments.Without going into long, tedious details, the main problems consisted of the DVD player failing.  I contacted HP tech support, which I personally think is very good - I got e-mail replies within a couple of hours and they continued to try to work with me.  Bottom line, I never did get the DVD player to work, which in many ways makes the computer useless as you cannot play your movies or music on disk and you cannot download the software programs that come with new hardware items such as printers, etc.The other major thing that started to happen was the computer just began shutting down for no apparent reason.  I contacted HP tech support and tried many interventions without fixing the problem.  The most recent thing (disaster!) which happened was all of a sudden I got a blue screen with the dreaded message: \"Fatal System Failure.\"  I have no formal training with computers; however, I have used them for years and have sort of learned along the way.  So, I tried everything that I could think of and finally got the laptop to boot up.  Everything looked okay, except as I checked things out further, I discovered that I had lost all of my files!  I was so grateful that just 3 weeks before I had subscribed to a back-up service which daily scans and stores the contents of your computer, so I was able to successfully restore everything.  (By the way, I highly recommend getting a reputable back-up service.  It can prevent disaster!)So, now everything is restored (at least for the moment) and I haven't had a shut-down in a while, but the DVD unit still does not work.  Plus, I have \"lost faith\" in the computer.  With the kind of work that I do, which includes being a webmaster, I MUST have a reliable machine that I can trust.Rather than return the computer and go thru whatever delays that may entail, I have decided to try a different brand.  I had poor luck with my last HP Pavilion, so I am ready for a brand change.  The other computer also had problems with the DVD unit.  In my opinion, HP does not produce the high-quality computers that they used to a while back.My very first computer many years ago was an Acer, which I had good luck with, so I have decided to go back and give that brand a re-try.  I will return this HP unit for whatever repair or replacement HP may give, but I will not use it as my primary computer.I hope this review has been useful.  I think many times a review is done before the \"honeymoon\" for a given product is over and in my opinion many of those early reviews are skewed towards the positive.  Since I have had this computer for over 6 months, I do think this review might be a bit more accurate than those done after just a few weeks or less of product use.  Wishing you the best of luck with your computer search!","Date":"September 15, 2009"}

Shipped it back, they \"fixed\" it, and when I got it back 1/2 the memory was missing and the unit was still not fixed (same problems).  So I got a case manager and an \"escalated 2nd service\".  Now I'm told that they've taken enough time to run out the warranty, and they want $300+ to fix what they failed to fix on the first repair.Next time, I'll buy something built by a reputable company.

I've had the Pavailion dv7 for about a year with no problems, then as soon as the warranty expires so does the device. Contacting customer support is about as useful as shooting yourself in the face. They are really sales people that are more interested in selling you more products that will not fix your device, and all done in bad english.

HP support 6 months later and 25 calls later they have yet to bother to even try to fix this machine with this known issue!!!!!!!!

I think it is the flatness of the keys as well as the color and gloss that makes it difficult.  Also, the PC lays fairly flat if you don't buy the longer life battery so that may contribute.  Note that the model offered via Amazon is NOT the same as you see in Best Buy, etc. That one is a DV7-1245.

I contacted HP to fix it and before I agreed to send it in, I was told that \"it would be $399 to send it in, look at it and fix it, however if the cost of the repair is less than this amount, I would be refunded the difference.  They charged me $422.80 to CLEAN THE FAN!  They also (allegedly) replaced the sound card ($50) and Ethernet card ($25).  Their report was cryptic at best and when I called to get explanation of the charges, I had to spend hours talking to different people to get \"escalated\" up to a \"case manager\".  Then I was told VERY rudely, \"It costs what it costs.  For you to call up a company as big as HP and tell them they are wrong is crazy.\"  Now five months after that ordeal, the power connection to the AC adapter has stopped working.  Don't buy this computer or any HP product.  They are poorly designed and the customer service is absolutely terrible!","Date":"November 24, 2010"}

Last year the battery died and so did the adapter. 7 months later the the screen went black and the caps and number lock lights kept flashing. I called HP Support and they told me that it was out of warranty and that it might be the motherboard, and they can sell me a new mother board. OMG! I only had it for three years.

Sometimes when it has been on hibernate and I open it up the screen will stay black and will not load anything, making me have to reboot it by holding the power key down.  Then shortly after the warranty expired the computer stopped charging and would shut off on me within seconds of the power cord being disconnected, then an error message started popping up saying that the internal batter needed to be replaced.

{"Title":"Same problem","Author":"Dudeskavich","ReviewID":"R1DMP96YBMY2OM","Overall":"bad","Content":"The keyboard is the stupidest design ever. I called HP to complain about the flaw in a dark brown colored keyboard that has lettering painted in a dark brown color, which makes typing anything, especially numbers, a serious hassle. What did the non technical support manager tell me? The keyboard is not a flaw, it was intentionally designed that way. If you don't like it, then you can return the product. Nice to see how HP is out to please the customer, when apparently they feel cocky and arrogant in this economy that they can tell a customer, \"If you don't like it, then buy something else.\" No more HP products for me, and by word of mouth I won't recommend their products to anyone else either.By the way, the same bronze colored computer sells at Sam's club, but with white letters on the keyboard. If it wasn't a design flaw, then why is the problem fixed on those computers sold at the retail giant?? My advice to anyone else is, complain to the CEO of HP, cause management doesn't care.","Date":"January 26, 2009"}

About 6 months of use, the battery died. Now i have to keep it plugged in for everything. Its always been slow, even with 4 gigs of ram, not sure if its because of the CPU or not. Even just playing youtube videos it gets choppy. I edit HD video sometimes, and this laptop sucks for that. Slow rendering. It is now Sept of 2011, and about a month ago, the whole thing started crashing. The worst part is, once its down, I cant turn it back on for several hours, usually a full day. It crashed a few days ago, and took 2 days to allow me access. Im not even sure if id call it a Crash, because its whenever the laptop is turned off. So if I shut it down right now and turn it off, it wont come back on. Its been on, screen up, for about 4 days now.

{"Title":"Cool while it lasted.","Author":"onmlate","ReviewID":"R3XIUBXZ45UEB","Overall":"bad","Content":"The laptop lasted 29 months before it totally fried. The problem is the location of the vents. If you place it on a flat surface the computer gets more hot than any other laptop I've ever used. The vents are literally in the worst possible location they could be. The bronze finish shows fingerprints and makes it impossible to see the keys even in a slightly dim room. The heating issues lead to it running very slowly, randomly freezing and crashing, and not starting up even when plugged into a power source. It also would get extremely hot in two specific places: the upper left and lower left of the frame around the keyboard. It took forever to start up even when it was new. 5-7 minutes from the time you hit the \"On\" button until you're connected to a wireless network. The computer's fan is extremely noisy and runs constantly even when there is no dust to overheat the inner components (I looked). It comes loaded with bloatware and while I was pleasantly surprised with the AMD processor it's still nowhere near the speed of an Intel. Also, it's not real HD. Eventually the overheating made the motherboard fry which I can't say I'm too surprised about. The volume and wireless network buttons are a joke: a touchpad that you drag your finger across. It's really hard to adjust the volume without disconnecting from the network by accident. Also sometimes it doesn't sense your finger at first so you get a lot of annoying clicking sounds when it finally does.","Date":"September 14, 2011"}

Even with 8 GB of ram and a fast disc.It crawled through the initial setup and I finally had to shut it down late into the night before I could do the \"Factory Restore\". (It did recognize Double Layer DVDs and so did this important backup on only one.)It loads many-many-many promotional \"Try it, You'll like it!\" versions of all sorts of trash software and defaults to a lot of promoter's \"Foot-in-the-door\" software and services.The anti-virus is particularly intrusive taking up the screen with a large banner that can only be removed if you have previously loaded Windows Task Manager to END TASK. And then before you know it, it is back again, blocking the screen and intercepting the keyboard.Another intolerable \"Feature\" occurred the first day I used the machine (day 3). While I was online downloading data and images that were updated every three minutes, it suddenly took over the screen and announce that it was now going to proceed with \"part 3 of 5. DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER!\" and my broadband connection was dropped and the screen continued with that message.I have no idea what it was doing, so of course, I turned off the computer.It has done that twice more now but I am ready for it and turn off the machine before \"God-knows-what\" it will do to the computer (notice I didn't say \"MY computer\".

I got it delivered and the first problem I had was that the computer was described as having an internal bluetooth antenna, which after searching how to start it for half and hour and chatting with HP I realized it was not there!  I got a discount from Amazon for this \"mistake\" which seems to happen quite frequently (I had the same problem with a Toshiba Satellite I purchased a while ago).  The 64bit Vista is rather problematic than helpful.  I am considering either upgrading to Ultimate or downgrade to 32bit.  Although its processor is ranked as \"genious\" and it brings 4gb of ram I have runned tests with my old Toshiba running 32 bit Vista with a slower processor and with half the ram and time after time my new HP gets beaten!!!!!!!!!!!!  I experience so many software related problems I cannot feel satisfied a single day about my purchase!  The speakers and volume control give so many problems as well: I place the laptop in \"mute\" and still I get a fraction of a second of the  beep of the instant messenger I use; the speakers are always making this noise like the power was just turned on; the volume control is non-responsive and then when it finally answers my command, it gets stuck both visually and audible.  I still doubt that this machine can be expanded up to 8gb of ram as the specs in Amazon advertise, but I have not checked this yet.  I guess I will get further disappointed... It's a shame that I feel this way for a laptop I found so captivating and (thought) powerful...  Now I bought an xb3000 expansion base (which is advertised as the compatible one for the dv6) and I found myself with the obligation to purchase a new A/C adapter since the laptop AC should work with the base but guess what? the dv6 AC is too big for the base!!!

Pretty normal and expected since I was turning it on for the very first time, right?Well, the 1st upgrade in the list was a BIOS upgrade, which I obviously downloaded and executed. The only problem was that the new HP Insyde BIOS flash utility for Windows Vista seems to be more of a threat than a utility. It simply popped-up a \"Verify Error\" message and completely frozen Windows and made the fan and HD run like crazy . Even the power button stopped working. The only way I was able to turn it off was by removing the battery. After that, the machine was completely dead! The power button didn't even light-up any of the machine's LED, not even the battery charging indicator.I chatted with HP \"support\" just to know that I'd need to send the laptop for maintenance. So I decided to return it to Amazon for replacement and now I don't intend to apply any BIOS upgrades from HP any time soon.UPDATE: DON'T EVER BUY THIS LAPTOP! IT'S PURE JUNK!I'm updating this review and downgrading this horribly built laptop to 1 star only (I wish there was a 0-star grade).After a few months, after I had already replaced it due to a bricked ROM, this laptop started to literally fall apart. The rubbers on the lid edges started to dissolve, I had to replace the original battery because it did not work anymore, some of the letters on the keyboard buttons became blurry because the black paint started to come off because of sweat, the left button in the touch pad \"sank\" and is not aligned with the right button anymore and most of its chrome-like coating came off as well.On top of all that, this thing is a fingerprint mess (both on the lid outside and on the keyboard and touch pad areas), it heats like hell (I can only use it over one of those laptop-cooler cushions) and its network adapters are rubbish: the Ethernet card, even though I bought it on 2009, is 100Mbps only (no Gigabit support) and its Broadcom wi-fi card is simply horrible!And I considered this laptop an expensive one (for a PC).

I thought I saw that it had a s-video output and a fire wire port. No s video, and I finally located the fire wire port, I think by going through my collection of old cables until I found one with the right fit for the computer and the external hard drive's fire wire input. Does not seem to be as fast as the USB connector though.There is a remote control to run the tv function, but I have not been able to figure out how to get either to work, and I accidentally stumbled upon the slot to store the remote while i was looking for the slot to install a game card. No slot for the game card, but there is a place for the remote. none of this is illustrated in the internal documentation inside the pc. It might be in the paper manual, but if there was a paper manual in the box, i must have lost it.within a week of purchase, the screen started to flicker. I contacted HP email support and did what they told me. The flickering got better, for a couple of hours, then started up again. I contacted HP again by email, got more instructions, and the problem got worse. In frustration I called HP support and spoke to a female operative who gave me vague and incomplete instructions on resetting the BIOS. After a contentious exchange, she consented to send me a box to return the notebook for service. It will be gone for two weeks. HP continues to assure me that all the problems will be solved, but I am not optimistic. In addition to the screen issue, the Media Smart Resident TV program stopped working.I was also mistyfied why the screen saver would not start up as scheduled in the control panel, only to discover after two weeks and 3 friends that the screen saver cannot work if I have my external mouse plugged in.The Altec Lansing built in speakers are about as crummy as you would expect to find in a laptop.I am stuck with it now I guess.","Date":"May 12, 2009"}

{"Title":"HP Garbage.","Author":"Deimos \".\"","ReviewID":"R5UPBT56MWI4Q","Overall":"bad","Content":"HP laptops are the purest form of tech garbage there is on planet earth.  When you combine with Compaq which is even worse, horrible results follow.  I can only strongly recommend that anyone looking for a laptop stay away from Compaq, HP and HP-Compaq machines.  My gf received this laptop two years ago to the day and it's totally dead right now.  Over the last 6 months it began developing a lot of problems.  The computer was never fast, always took forever to load up, had horrible internet service/wireless service and never seemed to measure up to what the specs were capable of.  Well The first problem we encountered was the laptop would start up with crazy checkered colours all over the screen and need several restarts to get going.  This was only 1/1/2 years into owning this junk.  Second about a month later the wireless card which was never impressive to begin with totally failed, so I had to buy a usb wireless adapter just to get it to work because it would be quicker than sending it to HP  for god knows how long.  The performance since the laptop was bought seemed to degrade rapidly until it was a pain in the neck to even use altogether.  A month or so after the wireless card failed the checkered colours started acting up again and upon restart the hard drive completely failed and will not boot up, the system powers on but cannot boot up the hard drive, it tries but it sounds like a car stalling out.  So in a nutshell this laptop barely lasted two years and was nearly unusable a year or so in.  I have never seen a HP yet that I was impressed with and now thank god my gf is turned from them as well.  I owned a Compaq laptop several years ago and an ACER with similar issues, so as stated I would strongly recommend looking at other brands and stay away from this poor quality, cheap unreliable hardware, over priced sham of a computer company know as HP-Compaq.","Date":"June 12, 2009"}

{"Title":"Quite possibly one of the worst laptops I've ever owned","Author":"The Gifted One","ReviewID":"R55KGZKWG9P3Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"Back in 2009 I purchased HP's so-called powerful high-performance HDX-16 Laptop.  I purchased one of the higher end ones.  Upgraded Specs were:- 2.53Ghz Core 2 Duo- 320GB HDD (after first year I upgraded this to a 500GB Seagate Hybrid SSD/- 6GB RAM- 1GB Nvidia GeForce GT 130MWent to the HP website and purchased this computer because it was supposed to be one of the best the company offered at that time.  Total cost after taxes came out to nearly $1,500.00.  I purchased it with the intention of it giving me good reliable performance for at least 4-5 years at a minimum.  When spending this kind of money on a computer, it's what a consumer would expect.INITIAL IMPRESSIONSFirst couple of months of owning the computer, it was wonderful.  Fast and reliable.  Large and beautiful 16\" screen.  It was very quiet and never even got very hot unless I played a highly demanding game on it.  It was very fast when it came to multitasking, video editing, and playing high intensity video games.  Initially I was extremely satisfied with the computer.AFTER FIRST YEARAround month 12-14 of owning this computer is when the problems started.  The multimedia bar at the top of the keyboard started malfunctioning.  Wi-Fi would constantly turn on and off on its own randomly while I'm using the net.  The volume controls would also turn themselves up and down randomly.  The battery failed around month 14 and already needed to be replaced.  The laptop fan began running extremely loud just from regular web-surfing.  It even started to run hot without even doing any demanding tasks.  Since it was past the magical one-year mark, HP did little to help and wouldn't even acknowledge most of these issues.  I cleared the laptop of all dust and bought a new battery in hopes of it helping the system.  It didn't change the heat nor the loud noise from the fans attempting to cool the system.  After researching online about this laptop, I discovered that other users had been having some of these same problems with this model laptop.  It came from the extremely cheap and low-quality parts HP used to make this machine.  At this point I felt it was best to just keep using this laptop despite it's problems since I paid so much money for it.YEARS 2-3 AND LAST DAYSA little after the full second year of having this computer, the replacement battery that I bought was pretty much dead again.  The laptop had began running louder and hotter than ever.  The media smart controls at the top of the keyboard were still running wild.  There periods of 30 straight minutes where the Wi-Fi would turn itself on and off over and over.  Making internet unusable for significant amounts of time.  The fingerprint reader still worked but there were times where it wouldn't respond and it was quicker to just type in your password manually.  Just as in the first year, HP would not acknowledge these problems.  Eventually I just became fed up with this computer.  A $1500 machine that only performed well for about 11 months is unacceptable.  This 3 year experience left me completely disappointed and angry with HP.  I will never again buy one of their products and cannot recommend them for anyone else who plans on using their machine for over a year.  I had decided to get an Apple Macbook Pro (2011) and to sell the HP HDX for whatever value it still had.  As if the disappointment from the machine itself wasn't enough, I had discovered that my grand $1500 machine deteriorated to barely being worth around $250 after only 3 years.  Most computer places didn't want to buy the machine at all.  Right now I couldn't be happier with my MacBook and a company who actually cares about their consumers concerns.FINAL THOUGHTSIf you're in the market for a new laptop, I have to strongly recommend you stay away from HP.  At least stay away from their so called \"high-end\" machines.  I honestly would not spend more than $300 on one of their machines.  I've had underwhelming laptops before but to spend $1500 on one that performs well for barely a year is pathetic and a disgrace.  If you're only a casual user looking to surf and use Facebook, then their low end machines might be ok.  Otherwise go with someone else.","Date":"May 15, 2012"}

It has been less than a year and so far I've had the motherboard replaced and now the HDD died. In both cases the problem was a defect that HP were apparently aware this model has. However, they didn't bother to notify anyone. Instead they quietly stopped selling them (if you check, you'll see that HDX18-1180US, HDX16-1140US and HDX X16-1160US are all unavailable).

I mean, REALLY lucky.2) You use it moderately, cutting down the inevitable wear and tear.3) You haven't had it for very long.In the first three months of having this computer, I could've screamed its praises from a sky scraper. And then the honeymoon ended.I will give some positives first: Screen size, clarity and overall display are great. It is relatively easy to navigate through all the functions and accessories.Okay, with that outta the way:I got my laptop customized direct from HP. I spent a small fortune to make sure I had all the speed, memory, and functionality I could want and then some. I got the Blu-Ray drive with lightscribe, upped the graphics, got the 12-cell battery, and upgraded the OS. And for three months, I thought, \"gosh I'm glad I didn't settle and get that macbook.\"After three months, the technical/mechanical glitches began. I needed the dvd/blu-ray drive replaced. The audio program and  panel began interfering with internet connection-- that's just odd. Mouse pad stopped functioning completely and I found out that this happens on these models. To fix it you have to send it away if you're under warranty or pay to replace it on your own. Either way, you're giving up your computer for a while. So I use a wireless mouse. Not by choice.The external power socket... expanded. The cord won't stay in on its own anymore. I literally have to rig it. How's that for janky? Not only janky but since it's hard to rig, charging became more difficult (as the cord would pop out with the slightest movement), and this led to a 12-cell battery losing capacity. What was once 3 hours of unplugged usage time now comes in at about 20 minutes and then without warning it dies. At least it used to warn me so I could save my work!!!I HAD to invest in a wireless mouse, but no way am I spending $ on a new laptop battery or anything else to band-aid the problems this thing has. I've also spent more time than I care to recall troubleshooting these and additional hardware and software issues.I've read a number of reviews of this and similar models and it seems like the same problems arise around the same time.

{"Title":"Nice laptop, but can not recommend","Author":"Curtis","ReviewID":"R1GPLW3PCR0O4X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had the HP laptop for about 2 years. There are many great things about the laptop I enjoy, but a single major design flaw forces me to not recommend the pc.I bought the pc for the graphics capability. Unfortunately, the laptop can not handle the heat generated from using the higher graphics capabilities. Sure, you can watch videos or play games, but eventually, the PC will over heat and then shut off without notice. Also, try watching a video when the PC heats up to about 150 degrees. It is not very comfortable. I thought buying one of those plastic pads with a usb fan would solve the issue. But, even with the additional cooling capability, the PC will still overheat and shut off. If you do not believe me, then search overheating problems for this PC online. notice in all the responses, not a single word from HP on how to fix the issue. I have even talked to other users with the same PC and they have the same issue.Overall, the HP HDX is a fine machine with lots to like about it. But as I said, the over heating issue should over ride anything else. It's sort of like buying the best car ever built, but has no brakes. You may like every thing else about it, but that single issue means you should never purchase the car.And given HP does not appear to have a fix (thus the cone of silence from them), move on to another maker (apparently, many of the HP's have the issue).","Date":"June 27, 2011"}
{"Title":"Detailed problem description.  BUYERS BEWARE!","Author":"Jeremy R. Higashiyama \"BlackberryJer\"","ReviewID":"R3NFPLCSWO91J3","Overall":"bad","Content":"I would first like to start out by saying that I take very good care of my computers and I do everything in my power to keep them dust free, dirt free, kept up to maximum performance. Now, I barely got this computer about a year ago, I bought it brand new from HP.  When I first received it in the mail, it looked amazing and had an awesome design.  Right out of the box, I turned it on and when Windows Vista was finished doing the setup for the first start, my volume kept going up and down, my wifi kept turning on and of, and bass and treble kept going up and down.  First thing I though was that there are updates.  I updated all my drivers and the problem still kept continuing.  First thing I did was call HP and it took me an hour to even get to tech-support.  They told me that I needed to send in my laptop under warranty, that right there should of been a sign to return it and I still regret not doing it.  So within 3 days I received a box in the mail to send in my laptop, I sent it in, I got a call a couple days later and received it before the week was through.  By the way, I will give it to HP on being fast as all the other computer companies usually take at least 2 weeks, at least the companies I dealt with.  So I get it back, and the problem stopped happening for a little over a month, but in just 2 months alone, I started seeing problems that put this notebook to shame.  On the top of the list,1. OVERHEATING!!!  Even saying that is an understatement.  When people talk about the notebook being hot and overheating, they aren't kidding.  It has 2 fans, a big one and a little tiny one.  The small one is on the bottom right next to the hard drive.  You can't access it easily to make sure its working or clean it at all.  Then the vent where its sucking air in, is only half its size.  With that being said, the fan works half as effective as a full vent opening would be for it.  Note:  YES, I get this is a more powerful computer, but if it gets so hot at the bottom that your legs are burning, don't you see that as being a problem?  This overheating is just plain ridiculous because, A.  Its not cooling anything off inside if there isn't enough cool air in it, and B, its also causing heat damage to other things, as the air isn't circulating enough in there.  Most people think a lot of us HDX 16 1140US users are over exaggerating this issue, but really, were not.  Right now the current temperatures areGPU: 60CHD: 41CTemp 1: 52CCore 0: 68CCore 1: 67CI also have a notebook cooler  under it, and I used speedfan to find my temps out.  Also it is about 72F in my room right now.Other problems that arise are :2. Battery wouldn't charge3. Screen starts flashing for no reason.4. Touch pad and click buttons started chipping, and the left and right click buttons stopped working and the buttons ended up popping off within a week of each other. Including the double tap.5. HP forgot a bunch of screws when they sent it back to me and the speaker grill keeps popping off.6. They changed the original webcam out with some cheaper cam and when your in a lighter room, the screen for the person seeing you on cam, just turns white.7. The screen gets a whole bunch of dents and scratches because the keyboard keys rub on it.  After HP fixes it, they send you a little note stating that you need to use a little cloth they is sent with your notebook when you first received it to protect it from scratches like that.8. The keyboard keys paint started chipping off too.9. My hard drive took a dump on me while I was in the middle of transfering my stuff to an external drive.  It started making this clicking sound and then a weird beeping sound and then while transferring my stuff over to my external, my computer froze and shut down.10.  Windows Vista.  Vista is a great idea, for a more powerful computer.  If you have Vista loaded on it, then there is no way your going to get any good battery life and performance at the same time.  You have to have it set in high performance if you want to do the simplest of tasks otherwise, its going to be extremely slow.11. HP's customer service, tech-support, and Case Managers.  This is an interesting one for me as I had not spoken to anyone but customer service and a supervisor(Who was the most rude person I have ever dealt with for a computer company) When I called  to ask to speak to someone higher, they opened a case and I had to wait 3 days for a case manager to call me back to explain the problems that have risen since I first received.  He seemed to help me alot and try to get it resolved but, when it came down to finding him to tell him there was a delay with my local FedEx, it was impossible, and they rejected my notebook for warranty repairs when it got there.  As of now, its been just about a year and I have had to many problems that one should deal with in a company as big as HP.  They do not treat their customers well, tech-support is VERY rude because they believe that you don't know anything and thats the reason why your sending your notebook in.In all honesty, yes, when in high performance , it does work fairly well, but if your not into the idea of having a hot laptop,  bad battery life,  or no durability, then I suggest looking into another company such as Toshiba or Sony's Vaio notebooks.All the problems could have been easily fixed if HP wouldn't have put the fan intake in such a horrible spot.  its in the top left hand side and if you have it in your lap, you for sure are going to be blocking it.  The problems that I posted are all  mainly heat issues and when my hard drive died, that really set me off with HP.  My last year of work which took hours upon hours to work on, are now gone because the hard drive pooped out on me.  Right now, I am furious with HP, and will NEVER buy a laptop from them again.For the people that say,\"Backup your work!\"  It's a laptop, not a desktop, its harder for the people that don't stay at a desk all day too do this.  For me alone, I am never using this at a desk when I am at home and rarely use it at home as its my music computer for writing music.Overall that, I will admit there are some pro's.The screen is amazing as its VERY soft on the eyes so it makes it easy to spend an extended amount of time on it without your eyes bugging out and turning all red.  The touch bar works great when its finally working right, the fingerprint reader is GREAT for the ones that try getting into your computer, the keyboard is perfect with the whole number pad on the side making it almost a full sized keyboard, the sound is almost as good as toshiba's notebooks but thats only because they have Harmon/Kardon speakers, also the bass sounds really good compared to the full treble most laptops have, and it runs great with games.  But from now on I will only be buying Toshiba computers as I still to this day have never had a problem like this with them.  Take my advice, spend the extra money to get something that will last longer and run better, these problems are not worth it in the end, and you end up paying over $100.00 for the hard drive when it dies, and I still have to find a touch pad that can replace my current, buttonless one.  Trust me, you'll regret it within a year if you do buy it.  Also, look into HP's notebooks having overheating issues.  They have been known to have the issues for a while now.","Date":"July 20, 2010"}

{"Title":"Poor Reliability, Frustrating & Expensive Support","Author":"ed nir","ReviewID":"RLZ6C515W8XQ6","Overall":"bad","Content":"HP Pavilion HDX16-1160US 16.0-Inch Laptop HP Pavilion HDX16-1140US 16.0-Inch Laptop HP Pavilion X16-1040US 16.0-Inch Laptop HP Pavilion HDX18-1020US 18.4-Inch Laptop HP HDX 16t Premium-Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo ProcessorP8600 (2.4 GHz), 4GB DDR2It is ironic I picked HP for reliability and service reasons. After over two frustrating months I can only report about poor reliability and extremely ineffective service. My new HDX Laptop still has major performance issues and the horizon looks bleak. I am considering making this purchase a total lose in order to save me from wasting many more hours of my time.Out of the box the laptop looked promising. for instance HP decision to scarify proper aspect ratio for the display in order to achieve high resolution at a lower cost seems reasonable (it uses standard HDTV screen rather than WXGA). Immediately it was obvious that performance was mediocre at best in spite of ordering the highest available options for my configuration (processor, memory, hard drive, etc. all superior to the listing above). Documentation was not helpful like directing me to unavailable features and options for the embedded webcam.I failed my first task of connecting my new HP laptop to my new HP printer. It is missing an essential HP driver that apparently was supposed to be install at the factory. After eight weeks and 50 (yes fifty!) hours of my time and similar effort from HP, the only option I have, is to start from scratch and install the initial factory configuration for the software myself. Since it takes numerous hours to proceed the inital configuration with missing updates, software configuration choices, installation of my own software, etc., I wonder if I should invest any more time in this computer. At this moment, the reason for the faulty factory installation is not on HP service map yet (likely a faulty sector on my new hard drive). Thus my odds to continue a long expensive path in reviving my sick new computer looks high.Since we are at the age of paying relatively little for much functionality and performance one must face the high probability of requiring support. If you like to follow excessive useless long laundry instruction lists (looked canned to me) of re-installing existing software that works fine, email HP Support and ask for help. If you enjoy long aimless frustrating discussions with mostly nice people but with lack of knowledge, ability, responsibility, or authority (probably the combination of all), than buy HP products. I can assure you that you will meet many people from the Philippines and India with various impressive job titles.While generating a rich set of service records, I was wandering how can HP afford to spend so much time and effort with a single customer on a single product with very low profit margin. Perhaps that is the reason why HP cut corners more aggressively than others. My personal cursory inquiry and Consumer Reports survey suggest that Lenovo is a better choice for laptops.","Date":"April 25, 2009"}

Based on what they told me, i ordered 2 gb of ram, which is now useless. I need one 4 gb chip.2) sending in the mail-in rebate was a hassle, haven't seen the $50 yet...3) And, most importantly, my new computer freezes frequently, such as when it comes out of sleep mode. A friend who had an HP and who will never buy one again said that this always happened w/ her HDX premium series... 4) The keys make too much noise...I like the speed and the price, but i'm not 100% sold on the purchase, and if the freezing up continues, it will have been a catastrophic purchase...Update: Six months out, I'm liking the purchase better. The freezing up hasn't been too bad, I did receive my rebate, and I've gotten used to the noisy keyboard -- now I barely notice. And I like the computer's speed.","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

{"Title":"For what it is intended to do...not bad","Author":"S. Melvin","ReviewID":"RZ8TL0OLYPR8J","Overall":"bad","Content":"Update: this particular model has a serious issue with heat. The internet is rife with compaints about the laptop failing to boot due to an \"overheat condition\" which is a fault that can only be fixed by HP or a trained tech who can bypass the heat fault. Mine experienced this issue and even with the new board and heatspreader it still died. I initially rated this a 4 of 5, but after realizing how bad the design on this laptop is, especially if you have this issue and have to take it apart, I have lowered my review to a 2 of 5. This major flaw is a show stopper for HP, which seems to be ignored through various models. Be forewarned!The laptop is similar to so many other basic laptops in this price range from the major manufacturers that it is hard to distinguish one from another.  The monitor is nice, the layout is alright and the overall feature set is not bad (camera, HDMI, remote, etc).  Overall, my initial impression (just pulled out of box this weekend and spending my initial time updating, installing and removing software) are that for the money, it will do exactly what we intend it to do--surf the internet, handle last and some current generation games, watch movies and provide access while on the go.  This is certainly not a desktop replacement, nor should it be treated like one.Pros: weight, camera, OS (64-bit should be the new standard), video card (for integrated anyway), and finally the HDMI and other connectors.Cons: lack of installation software (standard HP practice is to make you make your own copies using DVD backups, which is silly since you bought the dang license), weird molded corners that look/feel cheap, crapware (okay, HP and most other major manufacturers do this to offset the cost of the machine, which is a hassle when you first pull your new machine out of the box, but nothing that can't be fixed using some very simple uninstall assistance--I personally like [...] to remove all the stuff I don't need or want).Overall: for ~$600 with rebates and Amazon pricing it's not a bad machine for the basics of computing while on the go or from the comfort of our couch.  Great little feature set that should last you a while or at least until you're ready to move up to a more powerful laptop for a higher price.","Date":"May 23, 2009"}

I bought two 19.00 1 gig memory modules to upgrade them to 2 gig.  The back panel is a little tricky to remove, so be careful.  Otherwise, the design is solid and this D620 is a much better acquisition than a Netbook, in my opinion, as the 4 pound 14 inch monitor is light but not at all bulky.They are well worth the three hundred dollars with DVD read-writable/Vista Home Basic, etc.  They are made of solid plastic and unless you drop them they should be fine.As for selling one for 499.00?  Well, there are probably fifty better laptops in between 299 and 499 you could buy.a D620 only has2 USB ports and no webcam and with only 1 gig, they are a deal at 299.00, not a deal at much more than that.jhA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez","Date":"December 29, 2008"}

No longer for creative Professionals","Author":"Nick \"CellGeek\"","ReviewID":"R1YV1AYHEWP7TH","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}

When I tried to get apple 90 day phone support, Apple recognizes the serial number as 4 month old, so no help in configuring any network/firewall. I'm a first time mac user, switching from PC.2. Apple dropped the price on this item by about 400 dollars. I cannot exchange with Amazon, or get a refund, although I'm within the 30 day return period. They want a minimum 15% restock fee. Just got off the phone with a Codie B, supervisor at Amazon customer service. They are absolutely no help, wish I had bought this at my local BEST BUY, where there is price match/guarantee.3. I'm very disappointed that Amazon treats a loyal regular customer this way. Now ex-customer.All rantings and frustration aside, This is a Fantastic Product from Apple. Being a first time Mac user, coming from a predominantly Linux and Windows world, the mac hardware is the tops. Not to mention Leopard, has everything I need. I eventually set up my firewall,( ipfw script with a startup plist in /System dir). As I come from a Unix b/g, I'm comfortable with configuration, a little phone help from apple would have been much appreciated, and deserved, after paying so much.I rate 1 star for my experience with buying this from Amazon.The product itself would rate 5 stars.I had done a lot of research, before buying, and nobody else offers the same top level hardware and OS that will do everything you ask of it.Some of the goodies, out of the box, like, In built VNC(server and client), SMB print/file sharing, Security, and amazing speed. Top that with no extra anti-virus s/w or subscriptions to purchase like some other OSes. I get a battery duration of about 5.5 hours, when I just browse/read. The list goes on, DiskUtility that can resize and partition without destroying data, multi-touch trackpad while reading, very small os memory footprint,  Xcode looks very promising... I found a freeware utility that will \"burn\" Audio-DVD too, along with other formats.Apple has a this approach, of exposing elegant and minimal menus on the outside to users, but as we dig deeper, are rewarded with more and more details. As you delve deeper, more details and options are available.All in all my personal opinion: If you are planning to buy this, look at the new 15inch, 2.8 Ghz configuration, it has the same 6Mb L2 cache, that's touted as the number one reason for performance increase by Intel. Just dont buy from Amazon. :-)","Date":"June 11, 2009"}

I wrote to Apple corporate legal directly and they ignored my letter and sent it back to customer service for a boilerplate reply.

My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be \"Materially Defective\" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.

If you look at how the keyboard was designed from the inside, it's not surprising that it has issues.- The dual-link dvi cable (after waiting for months for it to come out after being on back order) wigs out and starts displaying junk on 30\" monitors. Apple later declared retroactively that the cable will only work on Apple branded 30\" monitors. A lot of people are upset about this.- Given the size of the screen, the screen real-estate (measured in pixels) is very small. Especially sucks if your 30\" monitor is dead in the water.- The edges of the laptop are sharp.- The laptop only opens to ~130 degrees,- Runs hot.- Fan goes crazy if the bottom is covered up.- Optical drive makes noise everytime you wake the laptop.","Date":"January 20, 2009"}

OS X is a so so OS, the system runs ok same as any other MAC I guess. I bought an ACER Extenza 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM, 320gb HD w. Vista Home Premium and it's way faster then the macbook pro. At which time I realized that the macbook pro had cost me three times as much for less performance and speed...plus no games and minimal apple only applications/software. For the price macbook pro's should be a hell of alot faster. Plus in a few years....good luck upgrading. The DVD/CD rom drive sucks because unlike my ACER or any PC/laptop it doesen't have the eject button right on the dvd drive, so if your MAC locks up (which it will) there's no way to eject the cd/dvd (yes I tried to keyboard eject button) with the mac locked up it's useless. I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple. No MAC is worth the asking price, they are generally slower than any PC/Windows based Laptop I have ever compared it too and are severly limited compared to windows users. Save your money, buy a high end windows laptop and a PC together for less then what Apple wants for their Macbooks. Next off, as stated this laptop is half as fast as an ACER Extanza or Gateway T-Series with the same specs. The pro gets boiling hot when running simple apps, and even gets so hot it could damn near start a fire, it's hot enough that you can bearly stand to touch it near the battery and under the screen/keyboard. It can't run windows for crap, even with boot camp. I boot camped Windows XP and the mac pro had an extremely hard time running it, taking forever to boot up and shut down, im talking like 10 mins. That goes to show that windows based laptops (PC's) are faster and better. Little heat, top notch speed (totally smoked the macbook pro easily). A mac runs OS X duh good but can't even handle XP......sad. Mac sucks. Overpriced BS.","Date":"January 29, 2009"}

I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback). God loves you.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}

And that is true, only you have to remember one aspect of that: they are great WHEN they are working properly.Mine has had three serious problems in just one year. The first happened right out of the box, the logic board came with some kind of malfunction and Apple had to change it. Two months after that the problem was with the internal microphone, and again bring it to apple to fix it...now, just as the one year guarantee ended, another important problem, this time with the magic pad. This time, however, not even apple knows for sure what is happening, and if you browse on blogs, you will see that a lot of people experience the same as I am now experiencing, and no clue to how to solve. I am sure that whoever read this and had not experienced any problem will say I was not lucky with my equipment, that they NEVER had any problem, etc...but the fact is, apple does have a lot of problems, with a lot of its customers and, what is worse, the problems in a Mac, when they do happen, are ALWAYS harder to fix than in a PC. That is the reason they so strongly encourage you to  buy the apple protection plan, for another 200 bucks.But I have to confess. When everything is ok, the product is nice to use it, has great performance and great looks. Perhaps you are lucky and will not fall into the negative statistcs as I did, but if you do, you will agree with me that their products are good, not great and their support is far from great, if the problem is not easely fixed.

As of today the following components have failed 1) logic board (motherboard), 2) hard drive, and 3) wireless card.Now, you may wonder why I would give the product even a two star rating.The answer is service.In this regard, as the owner of several Apple products (one G4 Powerbook, one MacBook, two iPodTouches with a couple of 1G & 2G iPods thrown in the mix) I think it important for prospective purchasers to understand what they are getting when they purchase an Apple product.  Stated in slightly different terms; what is it that justifies paying the Apple \"premium\"?First, great design.Second, a very gook operating system.Third, excellent product support widely available on a walk-in basis.  (I can't imagine what it would have been like to deal with these issues via tech support in another country and a repair depot in another state.)Notice that reliability is not on my list.  It would be nice if it were but I think the reality is that this particular notebook is neither more, nor less, reliable than the other top-tier notebook manufacturers.Would I buy another?Maybe.","Date":"April 20, 2010"}

{"Title":"I really want to love it...","Author":"\"Father of Four\"","ReviewID":"ROO7VEL334PH5","Overall":"bad","Content":"I really want to love my 13\" Macbook Pro.  I really do.  However, the glare that I am experiencing is intolerable, especially when the Web page has a black background.  I tried a matte anti-glare screen protector but to no avail.  The protector removed the glare but caused white backgrounds to be extremely pixelated, so much so that my eye strain was even worse than without the screen protector.  I am not against all glossy screens...I love my Macbook Air's screen.  However, the extra layer of glass on the Macbook Pro causes these horrible reflections that can not be mitigated by adjusting the screen angle.  Furthermore, even at the brightest setting, I see both the keyboard and my hands reflected in the black, glass covered bezel.  Perfect solution would be to use museum glass or no glass at all with a black, non-reflective bezel.  When Apple offers that, I will buy it.  Until then I'll keep using my Cube and 20\" matte LCD display for my desktop (and hope it doesn't die) and the Macbook Air for my laptop.","Date":"June 13, 2010"}

First off...this laptop is not as durable as one might think.  The aluminum casing is incredibly durable, however it only takes a minor bump for this laptop to go out of commission.  This happened with my laptop.  I've had so much worse happen all of my other laptops and they all came out unscathed.  However, this laptop took a very small fall from a couch onto a rug and it is now barely functioning.  I'm not even downplaying in the slightest how small this bump was and I was shocked that something so small could cause a laptop to fall apart.  The Superdrive is broken won't take DVD's/CD's and I was told that this is about the price of the laptop to replace.  So I just went ahead and bought an external drive.  The mousepad isn't working so I had to go buy a wireless one.  There are several other things wrong with it, I won't go into EVERYTHING because I would be writing forever.I very badly want to love this Mac and I am willing to try again because it's possible I just got screwed with a bad one.  If you get this Mac, by it from BestBuy an GET THE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY!  Then protect it with your life because it can fall apart if you look at it the wrong way.","Date":"April 9, 2010"}

{"Title":"Do not Attem to order this through Amazon","Author":"Robert Shah","ReviewID":"R1GTE0S8W674PC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I placed my order on Sep 4th, and since I wanted to split my order into 2 charges with 2 different Credit Cards, I noticed I could not, and therefore I called Amazon's Customer service, and they told me that I could not do it, so I simply said, OK I will go to Apple site, and buy it there, and the customer service rep said, well what you can do is to buy a Gift Certificate with one of your cards, you get an e-mail right away from Amazon with that number, and use that, with your other card, and the problem is solved. It sounded simple, and I did it. I waited 1 hour, and 2 and 3, and then called Amazon again, and they said to wait couple of hours, and I will get it. I waited until 12AM Sep 5th (since I wanted to go out of US, and needed to do this before leaving), and they assured me by the time I am up, I will have that number in my in-box.Next day there was nothing from Amazon, so again I called, and this time I was assured by 5PN that day the number will be there. At 6PM it was there, and I used it and made a 1279 dollars purchase.Amazon tried to put 3 charges, each 1279 through my Bank, therefore they stopped all of them, and I did not know about any since I was out of the country, until Sep10th(which was the date, I was suppose to get the shipment delivered to my house0. Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers. I have been Amazon's loyal customer, and even though we are not rich, we bought over 3000 dollars of goods in the past 3 months from Amazon. I swear to my mother's life, that no longer will I do business with Amazon, after this past 10 hell days. I have spent over 19 hours on the phone, and have been so upset the other day, I thought I am having a heart attack, and guess what it is still not over, and I have to deal with it another 10 days. Just for one deal. Then people say what is wrong with corporate America? This is it, lack of care, and do not giving a DAM what your customer feels, and goes through. If I would have decided the other day to go through Apple (even though their laptop price was 10 dollars less), and was not a loyal customer of Amazon, I would have been using my laptop 1 week, and already was used to it, and on top of that I would have not spent 1 hour with some Joe Shmo on Philippines, day in, and day out.SAHAME ON AMAZON to take of customers like me and my wife this way, SHAME.Robert Shah","Date":"September 14, 2009"}

I say trying because when your not always trying to fix it, restart it, unfreeze it, cleaning it for trojans, wondering why the track pad wont work, wondering why the keyboard stopped working, wondering why it's losing your important company data and crashing when you don't even touch it for a day or so you may actually get to try and use it.  The idea behind this D830 makes me laugh.....a \"durable\" outer shell to protect junk hardware, I can see in a Mac protected by aluminium housing but not this Dell garbage.  Since I have been composing this review on My Macbook Pro which I do most of my work on now that I have the D830, the D830 just froze up again:  no mouse, no keyboard, shutdown option greyed out.....sigh, such junk.  I guess that's why the techs here myself included have to take Dell pc/notebook repair courses from Dell so we can fix our work computers all day and maybe get some work done, this is bull.  The only thing the D830 is good for is a coaster or a riser for your Mac.  Funny thing is every Dell I have owned showed the same issues within 6 months, XPS, Inspirion, Inspirion Mini, and the unholy Dell Latitude series.  For work this thing is a complete piece of junk, company programs without malware on them barely work or run, for anything else it's also slow and clunky compared to better, lighter, higher quality lines of notebooks.  The display is also very dull and not worth the money.","Date":"November 25, 2009"}

Yes, it is stylish and lightweight, and easy to carry (fits perfectly into her favorite handbag!).

Apparently there is no system malfunction, applications are kept to minimal, and the power-saving mode is set to high performance (at the expense of battery hours), but it is still too slow.  Small notebooks coming out of Taiwan in recent years cost less than 1/2 of this unit, and they are more than twice as fast.  If you are looking to make a fashion statement, then go for this Vaio.

Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.

However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine.Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, \"this thing rocks!\" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically.First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive \"popped out\" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives!Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed.Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger \"blew-up\" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me.Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops.

It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert.My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive.

The screen is sharp and bright, keyboard is ergonomic, fast boot mode is useful. Definitely for someone that is travelling a lot and needs a lite, stylish and connected computer - this is IT.However, there are negative elements that you may consider in your purchase decision:- Microsoft Vista makes it a VERY slow computer, with a lower than average performance index - including regular start-up, launching programs, video sub-optimal (I cannot watch iTunes or YouTube videos in normal conditions);- touch pad and stick are very sensible - I had to disable them and use and external nano USB mouse;- screen size is too small, text is very hard to read;- GPS application is crashing often, the wireless/connectivity dashboard has to  disabled to use the mouse correctly;- Internet Explorer 7 is crashing regularly, I had to use Firefox, Safari or Chrome.- short battery life - about 1 hour with only one wireless connection on (all others and GPS are off);- there are not useful productivity or multimedia applications installed, however there are all kind of obscure things pre-installed that take a lot of space;- Microsoft OneCare is very slow and clunky;- price is high, accessories are expensive, not a good value.Overall, this netbook is not worth the price, better value and performance may be found in Asus eee PC or Acer Aspire One.","Date":"April 5, 2009"}

{"Title":"Bittersweet machine","Author":"Sarah","ReviewID":"R1QNONEKJBICUL","Overall":"bad","Content":"I actually got my Sony Vaio N-series from Best Buy. However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine.Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, \"this thing rocks!\" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically.First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive \"popped out\" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives!Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed.Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger \"blew-up\" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me.Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops. However, my Sony laptop experience is nothing spectacular.","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

Heres my problem with this, I spent all this money on a laptop, only to realize that it didn't come with a latch! even after the salesperson sold it to me telling me it had a way \"some how\" to latch, and then after the first year of owning it, keep in mind my screen is now scratched... the hinges have come loose! - so stuff gets in the computer even more now... This computer would be great, if sony didn't have such a crappy warranty policy about replacing a damaged product, clearly caused by an idiot engineer that DIDN'T want to put a latch on my laptop!

They do run extremely hot, and if you have one that still is running I recommend you turn all the power management settings to maximum power savings, even when plugged in, to try and extend its life.  Another problem with this model is the very soft plastic on the screen. Mine have developed very deep opaque ruts, just with routine daily use with the provided pens. Another problem is the awkward battery placement.  They don't show it on any of the promotional pictures, but the battery sticks out very far on the hinge side, making it a lot harder to carry.On the plus side, the physical design aside from the battery is very good, with the machine working well in both notebook and tablet configurations.  The battery life is good for how powerful the CPU and graphics are. The screen is large and bright.  The price was good for a unit with these features. The pen and digitizer work very nicely.","Date":"October 28, 2011"}

You can't just take it to a coffee shop, because there is at least a 50% chance it won't work with their router. It is a useless machine, as it has terrible WI-FI. Just do a search on Google that reads \"2140 wireless problems\", and you will find large forum discussions of 2140 owners that have this same problem, or inability to connect wirelessly to the internet, and there is NO FIX available.

I have an 18 day old non working computer and Dell wants me to do the repairs???  I balked and then they agreed that since it was within 30 days they would send a tech out.  Oh, the techs don't work evenings or weekends, and I don't have a flexible schedule.....so we set up an appointment at lunch, and the tech doesn't show, only to call me to tell me he is on his way at the point I have to be back at work.It gets better.  I am livid at this point, what a waste of money.  I froze the charge since it was all so new.  I call back Dell again and tell them that I froze the charge and want to send the computer back.  Turns out I only had 21 days from PURCHACE to send it back.  Doesn't matter I've only had the computer in my possession for 18 days; it was too late since I was over the 21 days.  I could cry.  On a limited budget I get a computer with keys that don't work and service techs that don't show up.  By the way, the last Dell rep threatened to screw my credit up if I didn't pay.....got to love that....Buyers beware.  It's all so wrong on a number of levels.","Date":"April 23, 2009"}
{"Title":"It works, sort of.","Author":"GC0110","ReviewID":"R2C8WOM6WD43JJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've become an avid Mac fan in the last 1 1/2 years.  I have 2 Macs, for home and office, and I only bought this notebook because I discovered that some programs still won't run under Windows emulation on the Mac.My needs for the notebook are very humble, to run 2 simple programs, that I don't use heavily.  Beyond Windows and Vista being junk, my dislike for the Dell is the keys.  They don't respond well, and I either mistype a great deal, or they simply are not registering the keystroke at all, and so a lot of time is wasted. I've owned 2 prior notebooks, IBM's, but those were bought about 10 years ago.  I'm not up on what other current notebooks are like, but the Dell leaves me unimpressed.  For my simple needs, of occasional use, it's inexpensive and compact, and so I'll keep it.  But, having owned several Dell desktops for the last 10 years, the notebooks do not measure up.Other dislikes: the DVD tray seems incredibly flimsy and fragile. It doesn't eject well, and it can get hung up very easily with seemingly paper thin objects near its path.  The screen display has poor contrast, and I've yet to figure out how to improve on it other than dimming the brightness which doesn't fix the contrast itself.  Maybe that's Windows sloppiness, and not Dell, I don't know.The start-up on a cold boot also seems slow at least compared to my old Dell desktop, and especially to the Macs.  2 USB ports are stacked on top of each other and depending on the thickness of the gadgets can block each other.I also find it hard to open the case. Maybe I have too clunky fingers, but the other notebooks I've used had a more tactile latch and point to grasp.  And the shiny cover, all pretty and glossy for the first few seconds, is rapidly covered with fingerprints which detract from its appearance.Bottom line: it works, but attention to detail is not good, quality construction is missing (made in China, where else?), and performance is subpar.","Date":"June 16, 2009"}

It developed a hard drive problem after owning it for four months.  It needed to have a new hard drive installed, with all the problems and hassles that come with that process.  I'm still not sure it will last.  Do not buy this computer; do research, and pay a few hundred more dollars upfront to avoid the problem.

{"Title":"Piece of total junk","Author":"Deimos \".\"","ReviewID":"R2O1G364X2ZFTB","Overall":"bad","Content":"Ever wanted to test the dreaded blue screen of death feature in a Windows notebook, look no further.  This machine comes with Vista home basic and crashed ever 5 mins, even when I would fix the driver issues.  Then I upgraded to Vista home Premium which made the system more stable for internet use but still crashed an insane amount of times.  I now use a Dell XPS which is flawless, a Macbook Pro which I have had for a year and a new 24\" Imac, which  have yet to fail or error a single time.  Avoid the Dell Inspiron (this make of Inspiron anyway) it's a waste of time and money.  The hard drive's are garbage and the wireless cards used in this notebook and the XPS are terrible, zone out and fail in a month.  The keyboard is comfortable, alot like the Latitude keyboard but cheaper, and the dvd rom is brittle, flimsey junk.  Overall this is just a terrible computer in every sence.  It looks nice, with a nice design but it's a wolf in sheeps clothing, it's garbage.Highly recommend everyone avoid this notebook.","Date":"July 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"Buy if your looking for a headache.","Author":"Music like water","ReviewID":"RAZCNT7LZWCIC","Overall":"bad","Content":"Actually I would really give it less than 1 Star.In my experience, with this computer you will need to replace the battery after 6 months or less even with LIGHT use (at the cost of $175 through Dell). Secondly, your 'Laptop' will end up becoming a 'Desktop' because the screen will quit working and you will have to borrow your screen from your desktop (unless you want to pay the $200+ to repair or replace the screen).  Thirdly, you will find out that your Desktop screen will not keep a signal  because there are no screw-in options on the side where the connection for the extra screen is.  All of this will thenleave you with the the following options: a)replace the screen b)repair the screen if it is possible to repair or c)buy the replacement part that has the screws on it so your desktop screen will keep a signal.And if that isn't enough to turn you off, no worries, because it gets worse...After all of the above, out of the clear blue sky, your hard drive will take a dive & then all you will be left with is deciding which day to take it out to the trash.To give you an idea of how common my story is with this brand, here's some searches you can Google:1) Dell Inspiron+screen black2) Dell Inspiron+screen won't come3) Dell Inspiron+battery not charging4) Dell Inspiron+won't boot upBottom Line: Unless you are looking for a way to give yourself a migraine, I would highly recommend that you steer clear of this brand altogether.","Date":"August 1, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dell's Warranty: Caution!!!","Author":"James M. Bailey","ReviewID":"RDCMXOB58F500","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is my saga of attempting to use Dell's extended warranty.My saga begins in January of this year.  My Dell Inspiron Notebook began to fail.  This resulted in four technicians visiting my home.  I waited for one technician on three different days until he finally showed several hours late on the fourth appointment.  The first replaced my video card, the second replaced my video card but when this did not work, he phoned and another technician came and replaced the LCD.  The third replaced the video card, the LCD, and the motherboard.  There was still a problem.  I might add that with three of these, there was a long conversation on the phone.  I am now quite good at understanding Indians speaking broken English.When my computer failed again Dell finally agreed to replace my computer.  While very frustrated, I felt at least I was making progress even though this meant I would have to reload all my programs.  My refurbished computer arrived and it was an upgrade over my old computer.  I reloaded my programs but quickly noticed a problem with the hard drive hanging up.  I could not believe Dell would send me a computer with a bad hard drive but after talking to Dell again and running a long test, the hard drive was indeed found to be bad.Dell then told me they would send a new preconfigured hard drive and it would arrive in ten working days.  I phoned again in fifteen days and they apologized that there was a technical problem and the hard drive had not been mail.  They guaranteed I would receive it in five days.  I phoned again the next day and the person could find no action had been taken but he agreed he would send the drive and it would arrive in three days but it would not be a preconfigured drive.  I would have to use the restoration disc.I phone again and they said I would receive it in two days.To be continued.","Date":"November 4, 2009"}

As soon as you removed your thumb, it would do the same thing, making it impossible for you to type or move the cursor.

It takes a very long time to start up programs, long load times, long boot times, random freezes, hard drive problems after one year with further degraded performance, it's a cheap mess.  The laptop itself is very heavy and rugged but lugging that weight around to protect cheap unreliable hardware seems foolish to me.  The hard drive always requires at least 40% improvement on read times even right after a de-frag.  The track-pad stops working randomly and when using this laptop for work that can be a major problem and usually requires a restart.  Internet explorer crashes randomly on this machine but works fine on any other system I have , VM-Ware takes roughly 10-15 mins to load to a useable state on this laptop, the speakers are terrible, the usb ports require drivers to work properly and like most Dell systems I have used including the XPS the dvd-rom drive stops working and stops reading disc's after you install a few programs, rip music or change disc's a couple of times requiring yet another restart....the dvd rom icon even goes missing from my computer like you don't even have a dvd drive to begin with?!?!

I mean seriously, $600 is a lot of money to fork out for a product that literally falls apart in your hands. Okay, I'm exaggerating. But not by much. What a piece of junk! I had this laptop for a year and with normal use, the color wore off, the keyboard keys deteriorated and the letters wore off, the fake chrome sides wore off, and marks started to appear all over even though I -religiously- stowed the darn thing in an ultra padded carrying case any time I took it out of the house.Don't even get me started of the charging cord. HP has the cheapest of cheapy charging cables. They wear out in months and just aren't designed to be rolled up all the time. I had to order 3 of the friggen things in the  ridiculously short lifespan of the product. I will never buy an HP product. This was product number 2. All I have to say is between the two HP laptops I owned, HP is pretty consistent with the substandard materials it employs, the flimsy charging cables and overall poor quality and design. The reviews speak for themselves. I never buy a product that has an average rating of 3 stars. Eventually the laptop just stopped turning on. Why? I have no clue. All I know is I've learned my lesson. I am not even going to bother to fix it. It's just not worth it. It's junk. Garbage. Waste of money. Buy something that actually works and will last. This laptop on the other hand, will only bring you heartache, disappointment and suffering. That's my two cents. I hope I can save some poor soul out there from enduring the pain and suffering I went through with HP's poor, substandard laptops.","Date":"November 23, 2013"}

It was classified as in \"very good\" condition. The tracking on it didnt work, but i really didnt mind that too much. It came with a nice case and charger, external disc drive, mouse, etc.. honestly, it was more than i was expecting. Then i tried to use the laptop itself.. yeah, no bueno.The laptop had partitions set on the 300gb hardrive so that you could only access 12gbs of the computer. Basically, the computer had less memory available on it than my ipod nano. I probably could have worked around that, but 12gbs of memory isnt even enough space to download windows vista onto the computer, so my computer couldnt even function. Long story short, he sold me a crap laptop that didnt work.Lucky me, i have a genius roommate that is really tech savvy, and a week later, with hours of research, we found a way to access my computer with an external disc drive operating system that allowed us to reset the partitions on my laptop. We considered wiping my computer completely and reinstall vista, but the Product Key for vista was RUBBED OFF! So if we reset the computer, i would have had to spend another $200 on a new operating system.All in all, it's a nice laptop. The condition it was in? yeah, im pretty sure he didnt take a second look at it before he put it up for sale. Lesson learned: See your product in person, because people online will take advantage of you if they get the chance.----the only reason i gave it a two is because it shipped pretty quickly, and it came with a bunch of stuff i didnt know about.

On Dec. 1, 2009, I let Toshiba know I had to push the ac power adapter cord in with super human strength to get it to work. I had to open five separate trouble tickets with Toshiba, due in part to them sending the wrong power cords three times and opening two trouble tickets under the same number. Because Toshiba insisted the problem was with the power cord and because they sent me the wrong cord three times, I had to spend $100 of my own money to buy a cord. I tried it on one computer and it worked and tried it on my Toshiba and it did not. After many phone calls over almost two months of wrangling Toshiba finally agreed to take it in and they replaced the system board base and ac adapter. The repair lasted almost seven months. But the warranty expired in July of 2010. I recently called Toshiba and asked if repairs done under warranty have a warranty. Customer service transferred me to the Computer Depot. They transferred me back and then I get to a supervisor. The supervisor said your warranty has expired and that's it. She wouldn't even consider the idea that two months of my warranty was wasted arguing over whether the problem was the power cord or not was never addressed. And I won't eve go into all the problems I have with the cursor jumping around for no reason. I will never buy another Toshiba and I will never recommend one.","Date":"September 11, 2010"}

{"Title":"A/C Adapter Issue","Author":"Kevin S.","ReviewID":"R3EFPW0L3LVMOE","Overall":"bad","Content":"As it goes for the other, similar model, anyone considering buying this product owes it to themselves to look into the a/c adapter issue.Basically, Dell engineers its hardware only to \"read\" Dell branded adapters. After 12.5 months (just out of warranty), I received a message that Dell could not recognize my battery. The fragile pin it uses to identify it's own hardware breaks very easily, rendering the entire computer unable to charge.The computer still works, so long as it is plugged into an outlet. But, from what I can can gather, this problem is nearly universal. For my needs, it renders the computer a sort of toy. The fix will run you about $400.Dell is aware of the problem, but has chosen to do nothing about it. The fact that it tends to trigger just after warranty expires obviously gives them no incentive to improve.For more information, Google the phrase: \"ac power adapter type cannot be determined\".

{"Title":"Poor long term reliability","Author":"Task","ReviewID":"R367KTWEOR0YVV","Overall":"bad","Content":"These laptops have what looks like good hardware with a Core 2 Duo processor, ATI graphics, and 2GB of RAM. That said, I work in a library system that ordered 20 of them for use at the branches about 5-6 years ago and ALL OF THEM are now getting memory errors. It's rare enough for RAM to go bad, but for it to go bad on 20 computers that are all the same model, using the same RAM, can NOT be a coincidence. Clearly HP cheaped out on memory and must have just slapped an HP sticker on generic RAM before shoving it into these laptops.The following info will be more beneficial to IT professionals like myself.For those who are curious, I ran memtest on all the machines when staff at various branches were complaining about blue screens and freezing. 18 of the 20 machines failed to even make 2 passes in Memtest.Aside from that, the BIOS are terrible. I think they were trying to cater to people who wanted BIOS that were mouse compatible, but they really screwed up on this. Boot devices are difficult to manage. Even if you enable every boot device imaginable, when you start the computer, and go to the boot menu, you will only have two options: Internal Hard drive and \"upgrade bay\" which is what they put for ANY other boot device including CDs, flash drives, etc. If you are booting from an external hard drive or flash drive, you will NOT have the option to select which device to boot from if you have more than one attached. That means, if you are booting from a flash drive, and also have an external hard drive attached, you have to hope that when you choose something other than the internal hard drive, that the computer randomly chooses the correct device.These laptops have horrible compatibility issues with Ghost 11 and 15 and likely other versions as well. If you believe you will EVER have to use Norton Ghost to backup or reimage your laptop, do NOT buy this model.I would also recommend people avoid HP/Compaq laptops in general, as they are known to have poor reliability. Do your research and purchase from a more reliable manufacturer.","Date":"May 14, 2013"}
{"Title":"Utter Disappoint, but it works.","Author":"Ronie \"Goats & the Like\"","ReviewID":"RRRSBCQVMZTTP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this Dell inspiron about a year ago to replace my 6-year old gateway. I looked around at prices for lightweight but powerful laptops including macs, gateways, hps and sonys. The inspiron is not the lightest available for its power class (core 2 duo, 3G ram, 250G hard drive) and it even got miserable reviews on the battery life, but for the price, there was no competition.Pros:Regular battery regularly lasts over 3.5 hours even after 1 year of daily use.9-cell battery regularly lasts over 5 hours even after 1 year of daily use.It's pink :)Built in webcam, speakers, microphone all great for skyping etc.SD card reader and USB's on BOTH sides (6 total) make for nice use of a portable mouse & other gadgets.Cons:It's really fat and heavy. In fact my first impression of what I thought would be a lightweight model was \"oh crap it's heavy!\" When I tried to buy a protective sleeve, the store told me they didn't have any for laptops as fat as the inspiron :)The mousepad is consistently unresponsive! Not only does it fail to recognize my strokes if my finger accumulates even a little perspiration, but it often takes several minutes after bootup to recognize vertical strokes, and only moves horizontally even after opening and running several programs. It also randomly \"clicks\" so that when I'm typing, my cursor jumps around despite taking extra care not to touch the mousepad (ironically, it just did it as I was typing this sentence!). This is ultimately not cool and perhaps the main motivation for not liking this machine -- you can't like it if you can't use it.The built in mic and webcam weren't recognizable by linux software until the 9.10 release. pretty upsetting from a company that sells linux based machines.Despite having a 4-year customer support and insurance plan, I still can't figure out how to get hold of a Dell representative -- their website is completely incomprehensible making my customer support agreement nearly useless.Finally, the screen is pretty dim. in fact, the dimness that they use to generate the battery life is so dark that it hurts my 26 year old eyes to read. even now, plugged in, the screen's whites are actually pretty gray.------------------------So overall I really expected more from a machine that, after customization, cost me about $1200. When you spend that kind of money on something, you really expect it to be kind of pleasant, if not even enjoyable to use. After all, dual processor, huge hard drive and battery life of 3-5 hours isn't even competition any more....but, it does work.

I have had no problems whatsoever with my other Vaios, this model is a constant hassle. It makes incredibly loud fan noises, shuts down, or doesn't respond to keyboard commands while it is making the very loud noise. I brought this in to a specialist, they took it apart and could not find any reason for this fan noise. Naturally, while with the specialist, it did not make the noise.I thought that I would love this lap top, it was quite expensive at the time, but I thought that it would be worth it. After all- my other SONY VAIO laptops were great. Now, I find myself using the older VAIO, it is quiet and does not have the keyboard command issues.I am sure that other models of the VAIO are great, but do not buy this model.UPDATE-December 31st, 2010 - I read on the comments that SONY had finally admitted that the fans were defective and was willing to replace them. I called SONY, described the problem and they sent a Tech, person to my house to replace the fan. This all occurred within 1 week. The laptop works great now, no fan noise, no overheating, it is perfect. I certainly wish that SONY would have alerted all of us to this problem to begin with, it would have saved a lot of time. money and aggravation.","Date":"December 15, 2010"}

The Laptop heats up so much that it is too uncomfortable to hold on one's lap - even over a 4\" thick pad made to reduce heat transfer.  The fan has been noisy from the beginning.  Over time it has become even louder.  It almost sounds like someone blowing their nose.  (Don't even think about having a conversation with someone on Skype!)  I expect the fan will fail shortly.

{"Title":"Sony Vaio is awful","Author":"Gregory A Stanley","ReviewID":"R66SGS86SO3KT","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned Sony Vaio (both desktop and laptop (x2).  For years I bought into the hype that Sony produced good products.  Shame on me for blindly accepting Sony name brand products.  They are awful.  I am thick headed, in that I continued to give Sony the benefit of the doubt for years.  The desktop computer hard disc failed, 48 hours before I shipped out to the middle east for a deployment.  Hours on the telephone with tech support resulted in the requirement to ship the entire computer to Sony for repair.  This was the single computer in the home at that time, relied on for family communication by email while I was deployed.  Absolutely zero attention to this issue by Sony.I purchased a laptop before the desk top failure.  The first Vaio laptop was actually pretty goo - although very heavy to lug around.  It is still working - having been handed down to extended family.The second laptop ran hot right out of the box - the mother board failed in less than a week, requiring in patient repair by Sony support.  This took a week.  The computer continued to run unusually hot; bought a cooling pad to help with air flow.  When Windows 7 was released, I attempted to upgrade.  Upgrade was not possible, due to unavailable drivers for the video card.  Sony pointed to the video card maker, the card maker pointed back at Sony - neither company with any interest in solving the issue.  The consumer loses.  In retrospect, this was a good thing, as the mother board failed again at slightly less than 3 yrs of use.I purchased a Toshiba laptop as replacement.  Out of the box, powered up - it immediately found my home network, connected to the wireless printer, does not run hot, and has better speakers and produces video much more easily than any of the Sony computers.Sony equipment is junk.  Don't waste your money on anything Sony.","Date":"July 6, 2010"}

Didn't move them around much; his was mostly used to read the newspaper in the morning, check email, and watch an occasional movie, and mine was used to check email and fiddle around with Photoshop here and there.  We also both use Skype once in awhile; the camera quality wasn't good, but it did the job.  Both worked well for awhile - the keyboard is easy to type on, the harmon/kardon speakers are a nice touch, and no complaints in general.  Just over a year in, his camera stopped working; technical support said they couldn't do anything about it and were generally unhelpful.  About a year and a half in, my computer's screen started flickering/flashing once every ten seconds or so.  If turned off for a day or two, it would be fine again for awhile.  Again, technical support was completely unhelpful.  But this is the reason I would not buy a Toshiba product again: my power cord died two weeks ago, and his died one week ago.  They died within a week of each other!  We have no pets who could chew wires, don't move the laptops around much, and shut the power on the power strip at night / when we're not around.  I called Toshiba's technical AND customer support and asked if they would replace these, as they seem to be lemons.  Both were polite enough, but refused to help in any way, and could not offer anything- no replacements, no discounts, nothing.  I will absolutely not shell out $140 for two new power cords when these two died after two years; my last power cord lasted almost seven years.  I know generic replacements are available for pretty cheap, but it was more the principle that incensed me.  So much for standing behind your products.  I would not recommend the laptops and would not recommend Toshiba products unless you buy with the knowledge that you are on your own once your warranty expires.","Date":"July 30, 2012"}

{"Title":"AVOID, and also, don't believe what FRYs tells you about laptop batteries.","Author":"Infimae","ReviewID":"R2Z9GJK3AGNCUU","Overall":"bad","Content":"This computer gave me SO many problems. While I was pleased when I got it, this computer absolutely caused me to hate technology. I dealt with problems ranging from the soundcard to the wireless adapter to adobe flash. Better yet, over its 1 and a half year life I had to replace the hard drive, the ac adapter, battery, AND motherboard. I don't know that much about computers, but I know that's plain wrong. If you are lucky enough not to have the same problems I did, that's great. However, you'll probably still be disappointed with the meager battery life, the trackpad, and the customer support from HP.","Date":"March 9, 2011"}
{"Title":"Bad Omen!","Author":"Lola","ReviewID":"R3OC17S24BJPGT","Overall":"bad","Content":"Well, how to start....The specs on this quaint little laptop are pretty nice for the price. I've never owned an HP and I was debating between the DV4-1430US and the Toshiba Satellite A505-6973. Both had similar specs, the Toshiba with a bigger hard drive. But I'm a sucker for the 14\" laptops for their mobility. I must say that I didn't actually purchase the HP from Amazon. I got it from another retailer because of a lower sale price. So, out of the box, this is an attractive little unit. Light weight yet sturdy. Basic functions are quick. I'd heard that HPs ran a bit hot and that this model was not an exception. But I didn't find it to run quite as hot as my previous laptop that is only a year old (gave it to my nephew - that's why I bought this one). Anyway, for the basics: internet, writing papers, doing some programming -  it was fine.Here's where the review goes downhill and the reason for only 2 stars.Never got a chance to really test the \"entertainment value\" of the DV4-1430US. My keyboard stopped working. Wouldn't respond to anything. Luckily, I was within the time frame to return it to the store and did so immediately. Exchanged it for another - same model. By the second day of having the new one, definitely noticed that the hard drive was running very loud. I'm an IT Systems technician for a large company and while some people may not really notice the loud hard drive, I recognized it right away as something that would wreak havoc very soon. Because I have another week to return it to the store, I've hung onto it to get a chance to \"window\" shop for another because I'm definitely not returning it for the same model. Well, guess what....? Blue Screen of Death tonight. So, I'm pretty much guessing that's my queue to figuring out whether an HP is right for me. Too bad. They have some nice looking laptops.Will probably go with the Toshiba. Amazon still has it for a nice price and I'm a big Toshiba fan. Guess I should learn to stick with what I know works.","Date":"August 26, 2009"}

After a month of calls they finaly decide I need to return it to the factory so they can fix it. The kicker is now HP has decided they will no longer pay shipping to return their defective product under warantee. This unit has yet to remain operational for more than a day at a time, their tech support can't fix it (great at teling me to contact Microsoft; everything is Microsoft's fault if you listen to them) and now I get to fork out some $20-30 for shipping and insurance.

This was for desktops, which are still good - BUT. I have purchased 4 laptops in the last three years and all 3 HP's are not running. The one in 07 died in a day or 2. Returned it. The one last year, the screen died and can't get them to replace it, or fix it even though it is warranty according the the flunky e-mail support team. I bought another a week ago and was dead on delivery. The laptop I have still running is an old IBM. This is for my home use. At work I buy MAC laptops. The Dell laptops we bought years ago, some are still running even being 6-7 years old and swapping parts to fix others. I just bought 8 HP desktops and all are good. I would recommend a DELL or a Toshiba if you need a laptop and it needs to be a PC; but do not know how well their replacement is because they outlasted warranties unlike HP-Compoop laptops. Get a MAC laptop if you can afford it, and don't have programs that require a PC.","Date":"July 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Avoid the HP dv7 series","Author":"DC NY \"NY\"","ReviewID":"R1G248G33SUV8P","Overall":"bad","Content":"First, let me qualify by saying 1) My experience with the HP Pavilion dv7 might be a fluke, and 2) Amazon doesn't seem to sell my exact model number, so I'm injecting the review here, because HP deserves it.  My specific laptop is closely related to the one advertised on this page.Normally, I don't write a review at all, if the product really sucks - my experience might be a fluke, or if it's a book I might have misunderstood the intent.  But this laptop has been such an inconvenience, that a bad review seems like real justice.The battery is too heavy & bulky.  The laptop had to be sent back several times; the first time, they 'fixed' the motherboard, the third time they had to replace the motherboard.  It still has problems - if you try to work with only the battery (i.e., the A/C disconnected), you risk the laptop suddenly shutting down - even when the battery is fully charged.There are other problems as well, and frankly the memories of wasted hours are too painful to drudge up.I can't say great things about HP support, either.  Oh sure, they try to resolve things, they aren't impolite or anything (although sometimes the accent gets in the way, so who knows if they are polite or not).  But there's just too much back and forth, for many problems that you end up resolving with Google searches in an eighth of the time.One great benefit this laptop will give you - it will train you to backup your computer fairly frequently (I use Acronis for backing up & restoring, and it's a godsend), because you never know when you will have to send it back to the shop.It was a bad mistake, choosing an HP laptop based on the look and feel of the keyboard, especially when past experiences with Toshiba have always been positive.Try another HP series; steer clear of the dv7's.","Date":"December 24, 2010"}

I called HP about my problems with the blue screen and video problems he instructed me to do a full system recovery on my day old computer. The computer, after reinstall, came up and seemed to work then the HP tech told me to reboot the computer for updates. The computer then got stuck in a system loop and now safe mode couldn't work now.

Hewlett packard was on this report on there Lazer Printers. printing out a code in yellow dots on the paper. it canss what the document is. then Hewlett Packard gets all the documents and sells it to big corperation.

Hewlett pckard killed my account. Buecase I did not follow there rules and regulations. Ok Fine. building black market computers. selling in on the market. ripping off consumers and the consumers do not have the right to ask quetions on the subject? Hell I paid for it. I demand the service I need. if not. Hewlett packard dose not follow instutctions from the consumers. I am one consumer. when I told them them not do build dead computers for a living. build more and more and more. One other thing.when I tell Hewlett Packard to give me back the money.. there excuse is its too old. why its too old? HP dose not do anything. Waste my time and money. to enforce the all sales are final.I had persioal taken the mater to the US Goverment Atterney General office. I filed many suck reports on many charges I am placing agisnt Hewlett Packard. so far I have to hire my own atterney. Gee wis Hewlett Packaerd paid money to the Federal Goverment in order to have black market protection from the Federl Govmerment. the mail I have everty thime I file a report ends up with hire my own atterney. never send a federal agient to shut Heewlett packard down. Never both to ask me to look my my notebook computers and see for them selfs The Federal Goverment must learn about why I am doing my reports. lazy work form Federal goverment atterneys. come on. I got email from the US goverment not to keep filing new reports on Hewlett packard. I got snail mail demanding me to do the same thing. Not to file reports. Go to my privet atterney.Hewlett packard prodcution line is bad for the envirement. using not save production in China. in the USA its not allowed to use those hazard products however in China there is no law o hazard products.I do not recomand Hewlett packard to any consumers. If you want my dead computers to prove it. if any one wants one can buy my dead computers 1,200.00 each Full cost.if you want soemthing to use in court. some one with money wants to take down Hewlett packard can easy send me a message.I will be more then happy to support any one that is willing to take down Hewlwett packard.

It has plenty of ram, large enough screen, and more then enough hard drive space. The horsepower is there. The battery life is good, but I have yet to get 8hours out of it. I suspect that's mostly do to my power settings and that I did not charge it up when I first got it.The touch pad on this laptop is offset to the left of center, which is a bit strange and annoying. You will get used to it, but I would suggest you use a laptop mouse. The keyboard has an unneeded num keypad, but many people seem to like it. If that really bothers you to much though then get the 14\". I personally think its annoying as it does not make all the keys on the keyboard where they should be. The enter key, for example, should be the last key on the right.Windows vista is a little sluggish on this laptop, but that's not the laptop as it has plenty of ram and a pretty fast hard drive. I suspect windows 7 will be much faster. The 3 gigs installed is plenty, but why acer did not just install two 2 gig models and bump it up to a full 4 gigs beats me.Another problem with vista is acer only installed the 32bit version not the 64bit. The 64bit version would of been much better. The cpu on this laptop is only solo core, but it does have 64bit instructions.I do notice that this laptop gets dirty easy. I have seen finger prints on the keyboard and some gummy dirty stuff the back of the lcd. I suspect the stuff on the back of the lcd is because its metal not plastic. It could be residual dirt left over from packaging, shipping, etc. Nonetheless, it does get dirty easy. The keyboard gets dirty the most easy of all. Just simple typing, even if your hands are clean, will leave finger prints and marks. Therefore, I would keep a microfiber dust cloth handy for cleaning.Please do remember people, that this  is not the best laptop for gaming. If you want a gaming laptop get an alienware laptop or one of the higher end dells. This laptop is for business use or school use and it performs extremely well in that category.Edit:I figured it was a good laptop which is why I originally gave it shuch a positive review. The reason I thought that is was so good is because at first it gave me no problems, was very light, and the performance was high. After 1 years use though the laptop started to breakdown. Some of the screws on the bottom became lose, screw holes striped out when I tried screwing down the screws as the plastic used to make the case is a very cheap, battery wont accept anymore charges, blue vertical line appeared on the left side of the screen when the laptop actually did boot up, and the laptop eventually just stopped all together .. wont even power up and is completely dead.","Date":"October 12, 2009"}

A few days of use and in the middle of a presentation to my potential clients, the \"adjust sound stop play forward\" Controls started coming up automatically on my screen along with an annoying clicking sound. No Software update from HP and Microsoft would fix it. Finally, I found out from some online forums that its due to an oversensitive MEDIASMART touch panel that picks up static charges and interpreting it as human touch. A Kid suggested that I put some scotch MAGIC tape on the MEDIASMART bar and that fixed it. It even works with the tape on it.!! Next, It has a Glare friendly screen , which no matter what angle you are watching at, makes it tough to work in a room illuminated with natural daylight.

{"Title":"HP HDX16 Review","Author":"Eugene S. Anderson","ReviewID":"R1Z9C8C87V1NUG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had the HDX 16 for several years now and the problems I encounter keep adding up.  The first problems I encountered with the laptop were problems with the touch buttons below the screen. The touch buttons enable the user to change the volume or play/rewind/stop media and other useful things. The volume button and treble/bass buttons have a fancy bar that looks like it should indicate the current volume level but don't. The buttons are also a bit slow and unresponsive and may cause frustration with needing to hit the button twice or toggling something on and off accidentally.  The second problem I encountered was with HP software. There is a lot of HP software, but the only piece of software I liked, the webcam software disappeared. I don't know how or when but one day I went to click my desktop shortcut to the webcam software and it was gone.  The third and fourth problems introduced themselves to me as I began installing and playing games on the HDX. The third problem is that the graphics card sucks. I had problems tabbing between a full screen game back to the desktop. Additionally the graphics card fails A LOT. Even playing simple internet flash games can cause the graphics card to crash and force me to stare at a blank screen for a minute as it recovers, not to mention actual computer games. Everyday I visit NVIDIAs site checking for new updates hoping the problem will be solved, and it still hasn't.  The fourth problem is the laptop cooling system. Even the first day I used my laptop I noticed a build up of heat on the left side of the laptop. Just doing simple tasks such as typing on Microsoft word or writing a negative review on Amazon I feel an abnormal amount of heat. Now this wouldn't be a big problem if I didn't play computer games. Unfortunately this is an \"entertainment laptop\" and I am a teenage boy and computer games are my pride and joy. I started to play Napoleon Total War and after about 10-30 minutes BAM computer shuts off. I felt my laptop and it was scalding hot. I know you might be thinking I mistook the word laptop as a computer I can sit on my lap. However, I have a cooling pad for my laptop and it STILL overheats when I play graphic intensive video games. The only compromise I have been able to find besides tying my laptop to the ceiling and letting in dangle in mid air is to let about half the laptop hang over the edge of a desk. This is the ONLY way I have been able to prevent my HDX from overheating when I play games.  Overall I know this review has been a bit negative but it is these 4 things that of slowly driven me insane while having this laptop. I mean it really drives me insane not to be able to play my laptop anywhere without hanging it off the side of a desk. I am thinking about calling HP and asking what I can do, and maybe bringing my laptop into a techie shop and getting an upgraded fan. Bottom line is this is my experience with my laptop. I don't know if all other laptops experience this problem but if they don't I recommend you forget about the HDX and go with a laptop that doesn't have a fail graphics card and overheats on a flat surface.","Date":"June 24, 2011"}
{"Title":"HP I WOULDNT RECOMMEND","Author":"John W. Mccain III \"J McCain\"","ReviewID":"R3OCPQ1E9N6Q3G","Overall":"bad","Content":"You know, I have been a huge supporter of HP laptops for as long as I can remember.  This was my fourth HP Laptop going back about 9 years in all.  The first two still worked fine when I bought the third they were just to slow and technology on laptop advances lead me to buying a new one.  My Third Hp Laptop was amazing, light weight, good battery life, performance wasnt the best but still did everything I needed it to do but after 4 years and three deployments to the middle east the sand and crappy power finally got to it.  Then came this Laptop, figured I would splurge and spend good money to get a Laptop that was capable of playing games at that time, would have a decent battery life and I was really looking for the HD screen along with the Blu Ray player.  I spent nearly $1.600 on this laptop along with the docking station, TV Tuner which has never worked and an extra battery.  Boy what a waste that was, the original battery exploded after 3 months, then the Blu Ray quit working, the docking station still works great but the laptop not so much.  Now I have the Audio an wireless functions pop up on the screen randomly and you cant do a dang thing on the laptop while this is going so you have to wait for the computer to stop acting stupid.  The wireless turns off by itself without every touching anything and the thing heats up so fast and the cooling system sucks.  Called HP and well wish I could understand a word they said, replaced Blu Ray it works sometimes, Battery warranty was only 90 days go figure and well the audio and wireless problem there is no fix for without sending in for Mother board replacement.  I will not be buying a HP computer ever again, the build quality is marginal at best, the customer service well cant say how good or bad it is not a single person speaks english or even decent broken english for that matter.  I am done with HP for ever and this from a devoted HP consumer.  How about making products some were else besides communist China and getting people that speak english for crying out loud.","Date":"April 27, 2011"}

While I am not disappointed with this laptop, I would not call it a good deal either. The images are completely misleading.1. The extra laptop battery [12 CELL] adds to the weight and also adds a incline while you type( some people like this, but I dont) . I used a 14 inch laptop earlier and the battery makes this laptop a lot heavier. This is not shown in the image either.2. There is no FIREWIRE.3. The heat - I have run windows vista for 2 months and have used windows 7 (early edition) for 2 months with this laptop. I also dual boot with ubuntu. The laptop heats up a lot when running windows (its better with windows 7). You cannot have it on your lap for even 10 minutes. The cooling system literally does not even exist.4. The noise - When running multiple processes and heavy applications, it screams out. It is kind of annoying when you open photoshop and you will see a dozen eyes looking your way, thanks to the sound.5. CD Drive - pathetic and slow. And it screams a lot too.6. Graphics memory - i really do not see any difference with and without this, when I play games. The processor is no where near good.7. The webcam could have been a lot better.8. Its 4 months, and the keys are already feeling aged. Durability is not good.9. I called the customer support for the keyboard. I do not even want to talk about it. Horrible service.I jumped back to my 14\" HP laptop 2.2 GHz processor - [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ONCDKG?ie=UTF8&tag;=mama0f-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B002ONCDKG ], it runs a better processor and does not have most of the defects listed above.On the other hand, I am satisfied with RAM, harddisk and trackpad.

Well lets just say the day i got it the motherboard was defective. So i send it in to hp and they fix it for free because they have been having this issue with this specific model. So I get it back a few weeks later and it is working fine. Well after using it for a bit i notice some problems. When using the web cam that is built in the web cam can become disconnected. i dont know why but the same thing can also happen with the built in speakers. Also sometimes if you have the internet or volume shut off and you close the lid (putting it in sleep mode) when you re-open the lid sometimes you cannot get the internet or sound to come on. You have to restart. Finally The biggest problem i have noticed is that this laptop has a very hard time running programs like Google Chrome, Windows Media Player, and Itunes when it is not plugged in. Sometimes windows itself stops responding. this laptop is almost useless when it isnt plugged in... You may think this is the end but no after 4 months of use the motherboard again has an issue. so i send it away and get it back in a few weeks. a couple months go by and im still having all the \"normal issues\" until again the mother board dies... I find out that Hp does not upgrade your defective motherboard they just replace it with the same defective motherboard model. Now i am arguing with HP monthly about getting my warranty extended because i am having motherboard issues as well as issues with the fan. I warn you against purchasing this laptop. Hp has a very bad reputation when it comes to things like this and i am an example of that.","Date":"December 7, 2010"}

Purchased this HP laptop after being told HP corrected their problems with too-hot batteries burning up the hard drive and/or other internal components. This battery is outside the laptop on bottom back and is designed to raise the computer and increase air flow to prevent overheating. IT DIDN'T WORK!!! Technicians tell me consistently to avoid HP computers now (at one time they were the favorite recommended product). HP purchases cheap internal components to build their computers. They break, overheat, and cause your computer to crash. Mine died this week after less than two years (20 months) of light to moderate use. Product worked beautifully at first. After 9-10 months it consistently began to run slower and make noise when it ran. I have limited programs installed and have had computer specialists clean, defragment, etc... numerous times to guarantee the issue is not one of maintenance. NOT A GOOD INVESTMENT.

{"Title":"Good Product but Awful Customer Service makes it a no-buy","Author":"GeorgetownStudent","ReviewID":"R1J56JA1SREO50","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased a HP Pavilion DV6 laptop computer in March of this year. On September 8, 2009, my AC adaptor burned out and stopped working.  I spoke to someone on the HP online tech support website that evening and she told me that it would take over a week to send out an AC adaptor.  After some pushing, she told me she could expedite it and have it sent to me to arrive in 3-4 business days (arriving either the 11th or the 14th at the latest).  I waited for the adaptor, and being a poor student spending thousands of dollars on applications, I did not want to go out and purchase the $70 replacement from Walmart.  When I had not received a confirmatory e-mail from HP about the chat conversation and the shipment , I called tech support the next day and they said the product would arrive in 3-4 business days.  I received a call from case management asking if the issue was resolved on September 14, 2009, and I told them I still had not received the part. The case manager, John, basically said \"Well it takes a while.\"  I waited until Thursday September 17th to contact HP again and the Joyce from tech support gave me some story about how parts are backlogged and software issues and how it was unknown when I they would have a part available to ship.  She even had the nerve to suggest I ask around among my friends and borrow someone else's charger.  I told her the suggestion was ludicrous and asked her to speak with a supervisor.  She said the supervisor was busy and would ask the supervisor to call me that night.  Needless to say, I never received a call.  I called HP tech support at 8:30 this morning (September 18th) and Luv on tech support asked me to wait while he connected me to a supervisor.  I was on hold for 30 minutes to be told by Michelle, another case manager, that she cannot do anything for me and I have to wait for John, my case manager, to call back.  So in a nutshell, 10 days, still no AC adaptor, and still no help from HP.  Talk about great customer service - no respect for the time or needs of customers whose money they already have.  All I really want is an AC adaptor Fed Ex-ed to me overnight, and to arrive on Saturday at this point, or to reimburse me the $70 for a charger I will have to buy from Walmart.  As someone who spent several hundred dollars on a laptop so that I could do my work and school, this is not asking too much for a 7 month old computer.","Date":"September 18, 2009"}

During those four months, the laptop's been out of order (non-functioning) three different times for an aggregate period of about five weeks. During the first month, the hard drive crashed, and I couldn't turn the computer on.  Then the little chippie-thing that allows the computer to connect to my wireless modem broke down.  Most recently, the dvd player died while, at the same time, the new wireless card went kaputt.  Consequently, I've had to send my laptop away to the service department twice, and have had to reinstall some chip or other part so that the computer could pick up a wireless signal.  The computer has been a complete lemon.  My friends warned me about purchasing an HP product, and I didn't listen.One of the worst parts about my HP experience has been the attitude of the customer service people. The technical guys in India were nice enough, but they kept me on the line for more than an hour before they agreed that I wasn't lying about my hard drive having crashed.  My experience with the managers in the U.S. was much worse.  My conversation with customer service - notwithstanding all the scripted \"I'm sorry to hear that, sirs\" left me feeling absolutely powerless and with the feeling that, now that HP had my $500, they cared not a bit about my needs or satisfaction.So, be warned - this is not a good product.

However, the extra layer of glass on the Macbook Pro causes these horrible reflections that can not be mitigated by adjusting the screen angle.

Perfect solution would be to use museum glass or no glass at all with a black, non-reflective bezel.  When Apple offers that, I will buy it.

It makes navigating very easy - I have not had to use a mouse with the MB.- The backlit keyboard has a good feel and is easy to use day or nightThe Bad:- The Macbook pro stutters when playing back HD through iTunes! That's on par with my $300 netbook's performance. It plays HD video fine using other software, unfortunately it is crippled by iTunes and Quicktime.- The glossy screen is very reflective to the point of seriously hampering visibility unless precisely aimed.- 160GB hard drive in a $1200 machine??!!- Compared to Windows 7, OSX Snow Leopard is a poor experience. It is difficult to find applications (Spotlight does not index reliably). I have had to manually re-index the drive several times.- Battery life is not as good as advertised. It is only about 4 hours in normal use. The battery drains much faster than a Windows notebook is \"sleep\" mode.- I tried using iWorks '09 with Excel spreadsheets. Not only is the iWorks software difficult to use compared to MS Office (even my 17-year old daughter agrees), it also corrupts Office files. I switched to MS Office for Mac - much better.- I tried using iPhoto with my photos - they are all stored on the LAN. The stupid software tried to copy 20,000 pictures to my MB. I had to switch to Google Picasa to view photos.I would have given the MB Pro 3 stars for great hardware (despite the poor screen, and small hard drive), but the horrible OS and software coupled with the high price makes it a 2-star. Money is better spent elsewhere.","Date":"January 20, 2010"}
{"Title":"Airport Died after 1 year","Author":"philosopher \"krishna\"","ReviewID":"R2L6N78BFW4UEL","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this laptop Late 2008, with standard 1 year warranty given all the positive reviews it had received. It was great while it worked. However it seems that just after its anniversary the wireless wouldn't work with my router, which connects to about 5 other PCs without issues. Then the airport card finally gave up and now I get a message saying Airport not installed.I now have a laptop without wireless. I am trying to fix it myself, i really cant afford to send it to apple... funny that I can not find parts anywhere. anybody any suggestions on where I could get an airport card for this?... except ebay. Now that is something to consider. For PC's you can get the hardware anywhere..After doing some research online.. I found that there were some quality issues with airport in the past too... when brand new laptops wouldn't have airport/bluetooth because someone FORGOT to connect the pins?So yeah my advice would be to buy a good warranty on this.","Date":"December 30, 2009"}

{"Title":"Do not Attem to order this through Amazon","Author":"Robert Shah","ReviewID":"R1GTE0S8W674PC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I placed my order on Sep 4th, and since I wanted to split my order into 2 charges with 2 different Credit Cards, I noticed I could not, and therefore I called Amazon's Customer service, and they told me that I could not do it, so I simply said, OK I will go to Apple site, and buy it there, and the customer service rep said, well what you can do is to buy a Gift Certificate with one of your cards, you get an e-mail right away from Amazon with that number, and use that, with your other card, and the problem is solved. It sounded simple, and I did it. I waited 1 hour, and 2 and 3, and then called Amazon again, and they said to wait couple of hours, and I will get it. I waited until 12AM Sep 5th (since I wanted to go out of US, and needed to do this before leaving), and they assured me by the time I am up, I will have that number in my in-box.Next day there was nothing from Amazon, so again I called, and this time I was assured by 5PN that day the number will be there. At 6PM it was there, and I used it and made a 1279 dollars purchase.Amazon tried to put 3 charges, each 1279 through my Bank, therefore they stopped all of them, and I did not know about any since I was out of the country, until Sep10th(which was the date, I was suppose to get the shipment delivered to my house0. Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers. I have been Amazon's loyal customer, and even though we are not rich, we bought over 3000 dollars of goods in the past 3 months from Amazon. I swear to my mother's life, that no longer will I do business with Amazon, after this past 10 hell days. I have spent over 19 hours on the phone, and have been so upset the other day, I thought I am having a heart attack, and guess what it is still not over, and I have to deal with it another 10 days. Just for one deal. Then people say what is wrong with corporate America? This is it, lack of care, and do not giving a DAM what your customer feels, and goes through. If I would have decided the other day to go through Apple (even though their laptop price was 10 dollars less), and was not a loyal customer of Amazon, I would have been using my laptop 1 week, and already was used to it, and on top of that I would have not spent 1 hour with some Joe Shmo on Philippines, day in, and day out.SAHAME ON AMAZON to take of customers like me and my wife this way, SHAME.Robert Shah","Date":"September 14, 2009"}

It wasnt long before i noticed my lower palm start to hurt like i was pressing against a dull knife.  Full disclosure - i have big hands (not huge) so the positioning just didnt work for me, though others may have no problem with it.In addition I asked my wife to try it just to make sure i wasnt making too much of it.  When she went to put her hands down operate the track pad she was lightly stabbed (no blood or anything) on the small corners of the indent where you lift the lid.  Its that sharp!!!Add to that the glossy screen which REALLY REFLECTS outside lighting/shadows and I new it I couldn't keep it (not for $1800 purchase price!!!)Its a real bummer as all the new Apple models except the low end white one have the same issues - Im not a PC guy anymore so Im not sure what I'm going to buy now.

The processor etc seems to do what needs to be done and does it well.  It is however twice the price of a compatible PC.That in itself wouldn't be much of a problem.  Until there was a problem.My son wanted a Mac, as his first machine, since he was paying for it we checked out Macs and bought this model, he was very pleased with it until he opened up the casing yesterday and the display looked like the a squashed spider from a Garfield cartoon.I drove the hour to the apple store and am currently sitting in it.  I talked to a manager named Lloyd and a \"genius\" named Henry and they informed me that the damage was our responsibility and that repairs would cost $1100.  That is 70% of the cost of the machine and that price alone is more expensive than a compatible Windows 7 machine.I have been involved in customer service for a lot of years and I've never seen anything so short sighted in my life, my son will be purchasing a lot of machines over the next 40 years, I'll be purchasing several myself and have another son who will be going to college in a couple of years.

{"Title":"Wake up and smell the failure","Author":"J. Yates \"GR Fan\"","ReviewID":"RYZXY3B31N9KK","Overall":"bad","Content":"After battling Windows Vista, I went out and bought three more Macs. A Macbook Pro, a Mac Mini and a Macbook Air. A year and a half later I've learned my lesson. Despite their advertising, they are not very well made. Despite the hype, the operating system is quirky. They don't play well with otherwise stellar products like Logitech mice and they don't last. Why didn't I get a clue when, of two old Powerbooks, one had the motherboard replaced TWICE. The mac mini is the slowest machine I own. Safari is not loved by some websites (ie Audio Digest). The Macbook Air has been back to Apple twice. Once for a hinge issue, the second time for a new hard drive and motherboard. The Macbook Pro. suspiciously, has had no problems. So three out of five Apple computers have failed. Reassuring stats? No.Scared yet? Just wait. I have Applecare. You HAVE to have Applecare. Applecare is to a Mac as boiling is to Mexican river water. More $$$$$$? Not to worry. Apple knows we're all loaded and that money is not an issue. Even suggest to a Genius that something in your Mac shouldn't have failed and that you didn't buy Applecare and they will look at you like you offered to pre-chew their food for them.I really love my Macbook Air despite its lack of firewire, dinky hard drive, no audio in HDMI, its one lonely USB connection and fixed memory. I built my website on it. It has traveled around the world with me though all my pics in Paris were somehow corrupted. iPhoto? Snow Leopard? The Air? Hey who knows? Now it sits at home, grounded like a bad teen who lost your files and wrecked a hard drive. It is the worst thing that can happen to a computer... you don't trust it. And you don't have Paris.But it still does what it was designed to do: show the plebeians at any WiFi hotspot (via its little glowing Apple) that you either print your own money or haven't a clue what \"value for money\" isAs much as I like it, I will only be able to use it until it fails out of warranty. The repair for the first HD and motherboard were only slightly less than a new Air and were covered by Applecare. I'm not going to put any more of my own money into this thing.Bright side?  I still have one year left on Applecare and though I paid three to four times what a Windows-based laptop would have cost, in Apple-speak, I should be happy.","Date":"November 17, 2010"}
{"Title":"A lemon","Author":"Reader","ReviewID":"R2IIY925XUD5X7","Overall":"bad","Content":"We purchased a Macbook Air two years ago and unfortunately it was a lemon right out of the box.  Almost immediately there were problems with pixels on the screen going out in large vertical bands, over-heating, sluggish performance.  We purchased it for our son to use during extended travel in China, reasoning that the light weight would be a plus in these circumstances.  Unfortunately, Apple doesn't have any service in China so he was unable to get the problems fixed.When he returned from China we took the Air into Apple for repairs.  That was the beginning of a long cycle of multiple repairs and the nightmare of dealing with Apple service.  I've never encountered so many frustrations with a computer company.  Perhaps if you've ever had any serious problems with an Apple product you might know what I'm talking about.It seems that other reviewers have been pleased with their Air, so it is entirely possible that our experience was the exception rather than the rule.  However, a lemon should be caught by Apple's quality control process BEFORE it goes out the door, before it gets into an unfortunate customer's hands -- and that didn't happen in this case.Some things a potential buyer should be aware of...  The Air is basically a stripped down computer, with things such as a CD/DVD drive not included, in order to reduce the weight.  But you still need these components.  By the time I had purchased the additional items, including the expensive CD/DVD drive, the total package not only came close to $3000, but weighed significantly more than my small, light weight Sony which is a fully loaded computer, including DVD drive and extended life battery.Finally, from our experiences with trying to get the Air repaired, we learned that many of the internal components, including the hard drive, are non-standard and not easily replaced when they go bad.  When my Sony died after 5 years, I was able to remove the hard drive, a miniaturized Toshiba, and transfer it to an external case, enabling me to continue using my data with another computer.  Not so with the Air.  When the Air died recently, although still under the extended warranty, Apple was unable to offer any assistance in removing the hard drive.  Their service dept. said that the Air hard drive is non-standard and that Apple doesn't service it at all and that it can't be removed.  We gave up on Apple and took the Air to a local PC lab that was able to remove the hard drive and transfer the data to a new device which can be used externally.To be fair, we've had other Apple products that have performed well and that we've been mostly happy with.  Now, however, the frustration level, not to mention time and expense, in dealing with the Macbook Air and Apple service has turned us off to Apple forever.  We'll be sticking to PCs from now on.  Our Air, which still has more than a year of warranty on it, has totally died and we've dumped it for an Asus.  Check them out, they get excellent reviews (rated highest for reliability), have incredible battery life (10-14 hours), have an amazing warranty, and they make some very lightweight models (the UL series).","Date":"July 28, 2010"}

However, I had to purchase it again locally as my purchase through Amazon was a disaster.I bought this laptop from a seller linked to this page. The next day when I contacted the seller - because of a really lame lie he told - I fully understood at that time I had become the victim of fraud.However, because Amazon would not allow me to file a fraud claim until a full 26-27 days after the sale date, I did not get a timely refund, and I was forced to watch as the unscrupulous seller sold the same non-existant laptop repeatedly from this page.Now the seller's profile page has a long list of people reporting their own experiences of fraud. This weekend, almost 1 month after this purchase with Amazon, I am finally being allowed to file a fraud claim. Will Amazon delay reimbursement another few days while they attempt to contact the seller - this despite the long list of reviews (including mine) verifying that the seller is a scammer and has long since skipped? I certainly hope not, because doing that would indicate (I believe) Amazon is not capable of quickly assessing even the most obvious instances of fraud, but instead is pouring its energy into a slavish bureaucracy.The computer sales pages on Amazon have become so rife with scammer sellers that even me, a former entirely enthusiastic supporter of Amazon has to admit that this is no longer the place I had come to love.It is now not uncommon for me to find that after my order(s) won't go through the Amazon cart, I will later receive email invoices from the sellers (which look very much like the Amazon shopping cart) that tell me I need to pay by Western Union wire transfer to successfully complete the transactionI am discouraged. I no longer believe Amazon is a safe place to shop. I will add to this review in the coming days and describe my experience with the Amazon A-Z guarantee.As to the laptop, you will definitely be happy with it.

Out of the package it ran fine, but about 6 or 7 month into owning it, the power cord had to be replaced due to the faulty power input design. This continued (I replaced the power cord 4 times total). In the meantime, the hard drive failed, so I replaced that one, only to find that the computer would run so hot, it would shut itself down about ever 45 minutes on the regular for thermal protection. Then it would stay on any longer than 20 minutes after that. I figure it's electrical problems and/or the motherboard. Regardless, there shouldn't be any reason for this to happen to so many of the same model (my roommate had the exact model I had, and her motherboard fried after 7 months or so). Probably won't be buying another HP again. Lovely aesthetics, awesome entertainment software, horrible infrastructure.","Date":"September 22, 2011"}

I should bought a Dell or Mac. This laptop had problems in the first 6 months, I called the helpline which took the tech 2hrs to solve my problem&even; then I had to restore it to the original factory settings! I had to do the factory restore  again after the warranty ended due errors that kept coming up after I did a driver update from the HP update site, it was their update that caused the error! I called HP & was told I would have to pay $49.00 for a tech the help me over the phone ! I have had to go thru the  chat line serveral times to correct other errors&justlast; week the screen went black& the computer won't start no matter  what I do. HP will not help you. I called to complain & spoke to two case managers,the first one put me on hold while she finished up a previous file& then said she couldn't help me & then second case manager called me while he was eating,kept chewing in my ear & said HP will  not do anything since my warranty was over& this model is not the one that is reported to have corrupt motherboard. He said it was my responsibility to have purchased the extended warranty offerd by HP (once the manufacturer's warranty ended)& that HP will not do anything for me!

In September of 2009, the hard drive on it failed. No biggie, as I had my data backed up and it was under warranty. I figured, it was bound to happen to someone. Well, just today, the REPLACEMENT hard drive has ALSO FAILED.I was under the impression HP made good quality notebooks. Unfortunately, after my purchase of this particular model, that perception has changed. This notebook runs exceptionally hot, even for low-memory-usage applications. It frequently shuts itself off for thermal protection, which means if you don't have a way to cool this laptop down, you better save your data and OFTEN.This model also purports to have an ATI Radeon 3200 HD Mobility Graphics Card. If it does, it doesn't like to show itself. The graphics are gritty, slow to respond and overall do not function anywhere near as smoothly as purported to.I would stay away from this laptop. There are other models available from other manufacturrs that will run double the memory usage and not run anywhere near as hot as this, nor will the hard drives fail every 3 months.","Date":"December 28, 2009"}

The power supply quit working about three weeks ago. I submitted a help request on their Web site and after waiting for three weeks with no reply, called them. The woman I spoke with tried to trouble shoot the problem (try a different electrical outlet - duh) all of which I had already tried. Then she told me since it was nine months old, the battery (understandable) and power adaptor (not understandable) was out of warranty (six months for 'accessories'). I told her I was extremely unhappy and asked if she would like to make an unhappy customer happy for the relatively low price of a power adaptor (retail $49.99, their cost = much less). Nope. So I went online to the Web site she provided - and they are out of stock. So now I have a paperweight until ASUS can restock power supplies. My question, which I will never know the true answer is: Why are they out of power adaptors? Is this a systemic problem? For the light use this adaptor has seen in nine months (actually it started giving me intermittent problems in eight months)this is a very poor product.","Date":"February 17, 2010"}

I had problems with the touchpad and click keys not responding within the first couple months. I sent it in for repair and got it back without anything seemingly having been done to it. After a few more months, add to this that the computer would intermittently behave as though the shift key was stuck (I think you can't realize how many problems this creates unless you try it- very difficult to use the computer for anything!) Since it was intermittent, and was my only computer at that point, I waited a few more months to send it in. They sent it back and it wouldn't even start up after I removed it from the packaging! They now refuse to repair it since by the time I received it back the warranty had expired (although they sent it back more broken...). It starts up now, but only runs for 20 mins max before crashing for a few hours.It's a cute little pocket laptop, but be aware it seems to be made of the cheapest possible components (expected for price, but still frustrating). Also, be aware you can only reach support in the middle of the night (I never once got through at any time of the day, with 20-30min wait times at least). I always call after midnight; the people don't know anything about computers, but they're fairly polite.I expected this netbook to be low-quality based on price. Low rating is mainly for refusal to repair what they broke. I suggest saving up a little longer and putting money towards a less extremely-feeble budget laptop (or for mobility, maybe a smartphone? even smaller, similar quality).","Date":"November 8, 2010"}

Keytravel is tolerable, but not great. Sound quality lacks but who doesn't use headphones with a laptop? DVDR and digital media drive. I don't like integrated webcams. (did no one read 1984?) It runs fairly cool compared to other laptops I've used.Windows never even booted on my machine. I installed slackware 13 on the first boot.X-windows (xorg) displays at factory resolution out of the box. Slackware 13 sees the integrated WiFi driver out of the box, which means most other linux distros should too. (not so with the copper network interface)  Linux also sees the DVDR out of the box.Decent support if you can find the phone number... I remember that was hunt the first time around, and rather irritated me. Acer doesn't seem too interested in taking responsibility for their products, but once you get a hold of them, they sort it out in a fairly prompt way.battery life is acceptable. Break your batteries in properly, and you will generally do ok.Size is just right. 1366x768 screen give a lot of visual real estate, and fits over a full keyboard well, while still being small enough to work from in coach.The bad:DVD drive was misaligned out of the box and vibrated badly. Motherboard was toast within six  hours of turning it on. Sent it back to Acer, they returned it with the DVD drive and the motherboard fixed. This procedure was fairly painless.  6 months later, the motherboard fritzed again. I think there is an issue with the radeon 3200 in this thing. It failed this time and I discovered that it will not display in it's native resolution, but other resolutions do work. So at least I can recover the hard drive.Low bus speed. I forget exactly, but I think the bus on this thing is clocked at 333, which is pretty antiquated. I knew this when I bought it though, linux blazes on it anyway, as expected.The integrated Atheros ethernet chipset does NOT have a servicable linux driver at the time of this review. I was really miffed about that. Seriously? What network chipset vendor doesn't release driver sourcecode these days? This is an oversight by AMD, Acer, and Atheros.Now that I'm shopping for a replacement for this notebook I've noticed this atheros ethernet chipset is in broad use. IT SHOULD BE AVOIDED, by anyone looking to run linux, and IMHO by anyone else too. Based on what I've read, there seems to by some funky bios hooks associated with Atheros chips which suggests at least to me, that proprieterization could be an issue.No legacy ports. I would have liked a 9 pin serial. Only 2 USB ports, one of which is sacraficed on the alter of Atheros.I really like this notebook when it works, which isn't often enough to keep it.","Date":"June 8, 2010"}

Umstot \"teka3\" (Seattle, WA USA) - See all my reviewsI bought this computer thinking it would offer hi-def capability, but it does not. It does offer an HDMI connection which I have not tried. There is no ability to play blu-ray dvds. Thus, it is just a nice wide-screen for playing non hi-def dvds. The wide screen looks nice, but it is more difficult to web surf because of moving the curser all the way across the screen. A standard size screen laptop would be lighter and easier to use if you are not using it to play dvds.Other issues: 1. Shinny black cover shows fingerprints and looks awful unless you constantly wipe it down. 2. Only 3 USB ports means you need a separate USB dock or are constantly plugging and unplugging. 3. Sound built in is very soft--almost inaudible even at max volume--I had to buy external speakers. 4. Everything except sound plugs in at the side, making it very cluttered. Seems some of the sockets could have been placed in the rear. 5. Power plugs in the right side, an inconvenient location. 6. Stainless steel inside makes it difficult to feel mouse pad--everything feels pretty much the same.HP service is also a problem. It has been outsourced to somewhere in South Asia and the people responding do not seem to understand what they are doing. I tried to get a fix on the low sound problem, but after many emails there was no satisfaction--you have to buy external speakers it seems. I also have a different dvd drive than the one specified. The service people could not answer why or what difference the drivers might make in performance.  It took at least 7 emails to find out that this computer cannot do any form of hi-def.I would not have bought this computer if I had known of these shortcomings.","Date":"January 19, 2010"}
{"Title":"Big Disappointment","Author":"Nom de Plume","ReviewID":"R227Z7G6J283UW","Overall":"bad","Content":"Bought this machine to replace my 4.5 year-old HP laptop.  Big disappointment!  First, it is overpriced.  Second, the display tends to be on the dark side.  The battery life is a joke--3 hours, max, and that's without watching videos, ripping/burning, gaming, music, etc.  I am not impressed with the speed, either.  My 4.5 year-old HP is just as fast, and gets MUCH better battery life.  In addition, the CD/DVD drive is very flimsy and made of thin plastic.  Looks and feels as if it will break easily.  When I burn a DVD, the drive makes a \"chug-chug-chug\" sound, like a train.  Ripping music from a CD is slow, too, and again, is faster on my old HP.  As another reviewer mentioned, the AC plug is located on the right side of the computer, which is inconvenient; I prefer it on the left, as do a lot of people, apparently.  The headphone and microphone jacks are located on the front of the machine, instead of the side.  Inconvenient, as well.  Windows 7, which comes pre-loaded, is a dreadful OS, IMO, but that's not HP's fault.  Can't wait to get my old HP fixed--yes, I will invest the money!--and start using it again.  I like HP machines and expected to like this computer, but I'm sorry I bought it.  It's not worth the money.","Date":"December 6, 2009"}

{"Title":"Nice aesthetics, poor functionality","Author":"Joe L.","ReviewID":"R3GA8SCD3DLXFF","Overall":"bad","Content":"OVERALL RECOMMENDATION:I would not recommend the HP DM3-1030US unless you're willing to live with poor trackpad functionality, an impractical keyboard layout, and a noisy fan.  I owned this notebook for a few days but ended up returning it.  I decided to get the ASUS UL30A instead, and I couldn't be happier with my decision because it addresses all the \"cons\" of the HP DM3-1030 while still excelling on all the \"pros\" I've listed below in more details . . .PROS:-Solid Keyboard Construction:  keys quite responsive with no flex.-Pleasing Design Aesthetics: beautiful brushed metal encasing, thin profile, modern LED indicator lights.-Battery: solid long, life.CONS:-Poor Trackpad Functionality (chief complaint): often requires several trackpad tap attempts before the system registers it as a mouse click; mirror-like finish is somewhat sticky and has a great deal of friction making movement a chore; trackpad buttons are extremely stiff and skinny making clicking extremely taxing.  For these reasons, dragging and dropping using the trackpad and buttons is quite cumbersome.-Impractical Keyboard Layout: I just couldn't get past HP's decision to require pressing the \"Fn\" key to activate commonly used keyboard buttons like Pg Up, Pg Down, Home, and End.  Another example is having to press  the \"Fn\" key to activate the F4 button.  So instead of just using the Ctrl-F4 keyboard shortcut to exit a program, you have to press Ctrl-Fn-F4.  And if you forget, you might accidentally put your computer to sleep because that's what the F4 button is used for on this keyboard.-Noisy Fan: when I first turned it on, I immediately noticed how loud the fan was . It never quiets down even if the computer is idle.  When you use memory intensive programs, it gets even louder, and the wrist rest gets really hot.","Date":"December 3, 2009"}
{"Title":"Very Poor Quality","Author":"Tom \"Tom\"","ReviewID":"R1822Z3DRQ56E7","Overall":"bad","Content":"Bought this because the price, $549, was attractive at the time.  The hard drive failed within a year and a half.  The cooling fan now needs to be replaced.  Search the forums and you will learn the cooling fan really only lasts a few hundred hours.  The trackpad does not work because of the weak frame flexes in your lap and causes the trackpad to flex in such a way that it shorts itself out.I mostly build my systems, or buy Asus and Dell.  This is my first HP product and despite it's good looks, it really is cheap, cheap, cheap.  They cut corners every where they could.Battery life is around 02:45 new.","Date":"January 13, 2013"}

{"Title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","Author":"BirdGrrrl","ReviewID":"R9VV3MG0W65SJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this computer in mid December 2009 and I have had nothing but problems with it right out of the box.  The freezing issue after putting it to sleep is highly annoying.  Additionally, it turns out after I spent hours on the phone with tech support and ended up having to perform a system recovery, that there is a known issue with the sound on the computer.  Music sounds like it's being played on a record player with a very worn needle and the same popping and crackling noises come through on Skype and video chat.  I'm sending it back in exchange for a new one, but I have no doubt that the second computer will have the same problems.  And mind you, I purchased the computer direct from HP with all the upgrades.  Stay away!","Date":"December 28, 2009"}
{"Title":"Could be a great computer, but sadly it is not.","Author":"G. Drobny","ReviewID":"R2M2F1XYZ2R0YH","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this computer 2 weeks before Christmas. I had never owned an HP before and despite my friends telling me to avoid this computer the look won me over and I bought it. I should have listened to my friends because I have had nothing but issues with the track pad, this includes freezing and zooming in and out for no reason. I fixed this by turning off all the finger commands. Suddenly on Jan. 5th, the computer would not turn on. This computer could have been a great laptop if it was not for the terrible track pad and it breaking on me after only about 25 times being used. As soon as I get it back from repair I am selling it and never buying another HP computer again.Pros:Sleek sexy lookGreat specs for the priceCons:Terrible track padUseless software installedSound quality is poorI would suggest avoiding this laptop and buying an Asus or Toshiba.","Date":"January 26, 2010"}

{"Title":"Poor product, no support whatsoever.","Author":"Lisa L.","ReviewID":"R3DZK9BXLMA6DF","Overall":"bad","Content":"I couldn't get the program to work correctly.  When it crashed without ability to access anything I installed the recovery discs which I had to pay for and have sent.  About a week's worth of no computer.  The discs wouldn't install at all but then did after using safe mode.  Not everything installed.  But be very careful because if you receive an update it will cause the program to not work again.  Re-install.  HP would do nothing for me.  You write to them, they call, they offer to have you pay for them to look at it. Another week no computer.  They tell you its fixed.  Its not.  They do nothing.  Bought another laptop NOT HP.  Went to our local busiest store, the salesman tells me that 80% of what they have in for repairs is HP.  Great, hundreds of dollars for instant garbage.","Date":"January 27, 2010"}

{"Title":"Pretty bad","Author":"D. Guerra \"DreamPhreak\"","ReviewID":"R1SU228HJMNBWH","Overall":"bad","Content":"I currently am and have been using this laptop for many years. At first when it came out, it was really expensive (I got it for $1200), was really fast for it's time, and pretty good. Now looking at it, it is very bad and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.Cons: The 2GB Ram is the MAX the motherboard supports, the 80GB hard-drive somehow is still magically working, and the 80GB space itself is worthless: I have 2TB external drive hooked up since I need a lot of space. The \"ATI Mobility Radeon x1400\" video card is really slow, doesn't work with a lot of games, and isn't even supported by ATI/AMD anymore, I AM USING 3RD PARTY VIDEO CARD DRIVERS right now; Imagine when Windows 8 comes out, i bet not even the 3rd party drivers would have an update out anytime soon. The DVD reader/burner constantly fails on me, i keep having to resort to using someone else's computer to rip the cd/dvd, save it as an iso file, and then copy it over using a usb. There is also a major problem with the screen hinge, do a quick search around for \"Dell Inspiron E1505 Hinge\", and you are sure to find some complaints and videos. I have NEVER used the MediaDirect, way too slow. Front speakers are really bad quality. Cannot play Skyrim, Prototype, any GTAs, WoW, LoL, Crysis, Starcraft, Wolf:ET. Can only play simple games, few exceptions for games like Minecraft where you can download mods to make it faster. Already mentioned this, but i must repeat: VIDEO CARD IS UNSUPPORTED ANYMORE, be warned! I cant find Official drivers! Havent tested recently, but battery runs out extremely fast, maybe about 4 hours without usage, and 2-3 with usage. No HDMI, but thats obvious considering laptop is 7 years old. Laptop is HEAVY and bulky, 6 pounds might not seem like much, but put it in a backpack and carry it around all day, it becomes noticeable very quickly.Pros: Keyboard area is waterproof (Dropped a full cup of water over the keyboard once, nothing broke, but don't try this at home.), buttons on the front are handy and work fine, never had this laptop overheat, i still have the original battery working 100% fine, 4 usb ports, ONLY 1 dead pixel. I only restart this laptop once every couple of months, or if a major windows update that needs to be restarted, but i cant remember the last time i kept my laptop fully shut off (not counting power outages), and it works fine overall. Linux works on it.Final notes: Again, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you just need a \"Facebook machine\"; . If you were seriously considering this, know that my CPU is 1.83gHz, the ad says 2.0gHz, but either way, that's pretty slow for today's requirements. Again, the Motherboard only supports a MAX of 2GB ram, thats horrible, even today's requirements have 4GB as like the bare minimum for today's times. I regret not opting for the tv-tuner back then, it would have been extremely nice to have on a laptop. Currently using Windows 7 ultimate x64. This laptop lived through windows xp, vista, 7, and about to make it to windows 8. I really cant say how many times ive reformatted the laptop, ive lost count. Even tried linux a few times, couple of dual boots, and once time a triple boot that worked just fine. Right now the laptop just sits in the corner of my desk on top of a very light-duty cooler, i use it's screen as a secondary monitor, and use a 21\" AOC true-widescreen led monitor as my main one; in comparison, the laptop's 15\" seems too small and square. I also use a bluetooth keyboard, wireless mouse, the 2TB total external drives i mentioned, 7.2 surround sound (a 2.1 and a 5.1, using a 3.5mm splitter). As ive said earlier, i never turn off this laptop, its been running like that for about 3 years out of the 7 years or so that ive had it. Its going to be one excellent day when i finally build my gaming desktop computer and throw this Inspiron laptop out the window for the dogs to sleep on.","Date":"April 30, 2012"}
