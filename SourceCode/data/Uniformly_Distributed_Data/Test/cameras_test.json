{"Title":"Disappointed","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3GDCPFTOO92WN","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought the A75 and was very disappointed in the quality of pictures.  It said it was Auto, but you better know a lot about photography so you can set it all manually.  I wanted a quick point and shoot camera.  The photos I took looked fine on the camera monitor, but when I brought it up on my computer they were dark.  The only easy thing about it is the menu and settings, etc.  But after 3 days of reading and trying to understand the thick book that came with it,  I gave up and took it back.  To me if I have to spend days trying to figure out how to operate something, it isn't worth having.  I ordered the Olympus Camedia D-580 and I love it!  VERY easy to understand, pictures 100 times better and they come up on my computer and look beautiful.  With the Cannon,  every person and dog had glassy yellow or red eye and I tried Auto and manually put it on red eye reduction, but still their eyes looked horrible. I'm sure if I went in and manually set whatever the professionals set, the eyes would have been fine, but I'm not a professional.  I want something simple and easy and fast.  Olympus - the eyes were PERFECT!  Blue eyes and brown eyes - no shine - no glassiness - no red.  Oylmpus instructions were a lot easier to understand and explained more, but yet in 1/4th of the pages it took cannon.  Cannons book - you have to keep refering back to other pages because it will say  \"Refer to page such and such\".  I don't have time to sit and keep fliping around to different pages. Also Cannons softwear - the 1st day my new XP computer reconized the cannon, the 2nd day  it would not reconize it.  Olympus camera - you don't need to load softwear at all if you don't want to - the computer will reconize it and you can bring the photos up in any program.The cannon would be fine for a person that knows a lot about photography and all the meanings, settings, etc.  but for an amature - I say go with Olympus.  And if you want your pictures to come out clearer and better on your computer to print  - go with Olympus.","Date":"May 29, 2004"}

{"Title":"Why, Canon, Why?!","Author":"Brad","ReviewID":"RB9NBB9CXYD2V","Overall":"bad","Content":"I give the A70 one star because of the mental anguish it has caused me, and not because it is a bad camera.  I don't understand the people at Canon.  I had a PowerShot s30 - an excellent camera, with virtually the same features as the A70, but small enough to fit into your pocket - but my s30 was stolen and I was forced to buy the A70 because the s30 was discontinued.  The A70 takes just as good pics as the s30, and it has almost the same features, BUT it's substantially bigger and it takes four clunky, heavy AA batteries rather than a small rechargable one half the size of an average matchbox.  I just don't get it.  With the S30, you had a great manual camera that was small enough to fit into your pocket and that was reasonably priced.  Now, Canon forces you to choose between a manual large camera, and a non-manual pocket-sized one.  Why can't they just revive the great features of the S30?  My advice:  If you want a high quality, low-priced digital camera with manual features, and don't mind a large and heavy one, get the A70 or eqivalent new model.  If you want any other mix of features, try something else.","Date":"May 25, 2004"}

The resolution is WORSE than my old film camera - a very inexpensive point-and-shoot - and it is very frustrating to use for several reasons:  1) the shutter does not go when you push the button - there is a several second delay - not a big deal with inanimate objects, but very difficult to photgraph people without getting funny expressions, and nearly impossible to photograph the baby without a lot of trial and error; and 2) the flash takes a LONG time to recharge, so after getting a funny expression in your first photo due to the shutter delay, you have to wait and wait and wait to try again - trust me, this gets really, really, really annoying very quickly.

{"Title":"Transformed a skeptic!","Author":"Rishikesh Bhalerao","ReviewID":"R1R0Q35C3UY8MX","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been a dedicated film camera user for several years and a skeptic of digital photography. Until now.I chose the Canon S50 after about two months of research into contemporary cameras. I relied upon a digital photography portal called \"Digital Photography Review\" to compare different models, and then used Amazon to compare prices. If you are making the move to digital, it is wise to factor in the price of image editing software (I use --and highly recommend--Adobe Photoshop Elements), an upgraded memory card, and an additional battery. The S50 does not come with a case, so add that to the list as well.There has been some fair criticism leveled at digital camera manufacturers for their emphasis on mega pixels. I cannot argue with this; however, having 5-mega pixels over 4 (at a slight price premium) does give you the flexibility to later crop images to your liking, yet, retain good resolution. One of the common complaints against the S50 (over the slightly less expensive 4-mega pixel S45) is the issue of purple fringing at wide angles. My own experience has been that, even at the widest angle, color distortions are virtually non-existent in this camera. The image quality is excellent and skin tones are very good even when using a flash. The flash is a tiny band at the top right (when you face the lens) but, despite its small size, it is very effective for indoor pictures. The camera is quite small for all it can do. The number of manual controls is astounding; I have a feeling this camera offers much more creative freedom than my previous one, a film SLR from the mid-eighties, which came with three detachable lenses, a separate flash unit, and a large carrying case that, when filled with all equipment, weighed about 8 pounds!Digital cameras generally have one drawback--shutter delay, and this is one area that the S50 does not perform well. I have seen shutter delay to vary between almost no delay to little more than a full second. Of course, I have not used other digital cameras, so I cannot tell how this compares. Another weakness is the flimsy lens cover: you have to be careful when closing the cover. I also managed to scratch the LCD screen within a few days of receiving the camera, although this does not affect the images in any way. A protective case would have helped (why doesn't Canon include one!). The included compact flash memory card has a capacity of only 32MB. I would recommend buying a much larger card (such as a 512MB card) that can store a very large number of images (several thousand at lower resolutions). With a large card, the battery inevitably runs out out before the card is full. Buy a spare!Overall, I enthusiastically recommend the S50, especially if you are making the move away from film cameras. The S50 has irreversibly drawn me away from film cameras, even though I did not think that was possible just a year ago. Perhaps it will also transform your perspective.","Date":"October 18, 2003"}
{"Title":"Best value for the money","Author":"scott \"scott\"","ReviewID":"R2JE6SIV1DFNOM","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my third digital camera, my previous was a 3.2MP Casio QV3000EX. While Casio is not a well known name in the US for cameras, it's still hard to find a digital camera today that matches the QV3000EX feature/price point. The S50 does this and more!The Good:1. Made in Japan (not China as some other Japanese cameras ie Minolta).2. Metal case, and it feels like it is well made (heavy). Buttons give a solid feel.3. Turns on quick - 4 seconds.4. Small size. This will easily fit into your shirt pocket. The S50 has the features of a G3 and the compactness of the S400. The best of both worlds. No other 5MP camera comes close to this size, with the exception of the Minolta F300.5. Extreme manual control: 10 aperature settings (most digital camaras have 2), 45 shutter settings! You will not find a camera with more control at this price.6. Lens can zoom in macro mode. Others such as Minolta S414 cannot.7. Fast Canon lens - great pictures in low light and little to no blooming (purple fringe). In my opinion, Canon makes the best digital camera lens. The Casio QV3000EX has a Canon lens, and it takes great pictures. The lens makes or breaks a camera, don't compromise here.8. Will NOT turn on when in your pocket. It's just plain annoying that manufacturers continue to make knobs that turn at the slightest touch. The dial on the S50 gives a solid and metal sounding click.9. Battery charger is small an unobtrusive. Fits into the smallest of camera bags.The Bad:1. You pay a price for Canon. But you get what you pay for. You can get a cheaper digital camera, but you will not get one that has perhaps the best lens, great auto focus, and exreme manual control, and - in the end great pictures. Take a look at the sample pictures at Canon's site. Compare them to similar cameras. You will wonder why you thought of buying another brand. Also consider the S400 for a more limited point and shoot, or the G3 for professional/traditional SLR look and feel.2. Uses a proprietary battery. To be honest, I'd rather use AA Ni-MH batteries. But with the Canon system, you probably get bettery power management since they can monitor the battery state better than if it is generic rechargables. In the end it's probably a wash. Buy a second battery.","Date":"May 31, 2003"}
{"Title":"Darth Camera - Canon Keeps Raising the Bar","Author":"Woo Song","ReviewID":"R1TEWPG9VLZZLA","Overall":"good","Content":"INTRO:I've had this camera now for 2 weeks and absolutely love it. I already have a Sony F707, and was looking for a camera to take around that still had the 5 mp output, but a smaller form factor. When it came down to it, it was either this camera or the Olympus C50Z and I'm glad I decided on the S50. You just can't beat the Canon for features and design. Plus, the C50Z supposidly doesn't have a mic for video.PROS:From what the reviews have said, this is just a scaled down version of the Canon G3, but with 5 mp output vs. 4 with the G3.It's got a very solid construction and I love the brushed metallic look of the body. It's not quite pocket sized - I tried lugging it around in my pocket for a day...a little bulky for that, but i'd say it's a great compromise for those that want more features than what the digital Elph series offers.Speaking of which, it's got a great bundle of features. Images are bright and very real to life. From what I can tell, it's very similar in general shooting modes as my Sony. I leave the camera glued to Program AE, as I seem to get the best quality and still have the ability to adjust the different modes on the camera.  The continuous shooting mode is excellent and the intervalometer (time lapse photo shooting) is definitely a nice new feature. Further the stich assist and video modes with sound make it a better buy over the C50Z.Also, the camera is very fast - from taking it out of the bag to turning it on, it's a little less than 4 seconds and it's ready to shoot.Further, the camera uses non-memory lithium ion - I have yet to drain the battery fully from a days worth of shooting.  I almost never turn off the view finder and the battery's held up like a champ.  It also uses standard compact flash, which I picked up at Amazon (256mb Viking) [at a good price]after rebates. Just can't beat that...COULD IMPROVE ON:The only thing with the construction that got me a little concered was the slide door for the lens. If you moved it a certain way, it can move up and down. Still, the overall construction is very solid.The macro is pretty average. It says in the guide that you can get as close as 5 cm or thereabouts, but the closest I could get in focus was about 3 inches. I guess it's the size of the optics.Also, why only the black? I really like the brushed stainless look of the S45, but you can't get that flavor with the S50. From what I've heard, it's only available in Europe. I guess it's a marketing thing, but still... Don't get me wrong, I like the black, but it'd be nice to have the choice and black tends to show dust quite easily.And while I like that it uses standard compact flash, I've noticed it's a little slower in tranfers and reading than Sony Memory stick.Anyway, these are negligible issues and overall, Canon has really outdone themselves again.","Date":"April 4, 2003"}
{"Title":"A Winner in Image Quality Versus Size","Author":"Roy Chan","ReviewID":"R8CLURC0WGUTA","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: Compact size, 5 megapixel resolution, ease of use, lots of creative photography options, Solid all metal compact body, Quality Canon lens, quality, enlargeable images, sturdy, macro capability.Cons: No provision for add-on lenses or filters, Expensive, 5MP is probably overkill for most users, Underwater housing does not allow full control, not as sharp as most 4 MP cameras, 4-way Navigation Button & Proprietary Battery, Some photos had red eye, doesn't come with carrying case.Summary: This compact Canon digital camera really impressed me in the week I've had mine so far. I've been looking and playing with the Sony DSC-P9 for some time but took a chance with the S50 sight unseen, with a few recommendations, and my expectations have been well exceded. Excellent image quality and easy to learn interface with ample effect, memory, and capture options are not compromised by the camera's size (slightly chunkier than the Sony, but still slips into a pocket easily). Crisp and bright image replay on the rear color LCD monitor. Easy downloads to PC with USB and unimposing Canon software, and fairly quick battery recharge too. This is a really great compact digital camera for those looking for great images in different conditions without a bulky, intrusive large body reflex. The movie capture is better than on previous Canon models, though still slightly choppy at 12 frames per second (not that making movies is your first choice in features for selecting pocket cameras). Nonetheless, after looking around I believe this is the best deal for quality/function/money versus size in the compact digital camera market.A+","Date":"May 11, 2003"}
{"Title":"Biggest bang for your buck","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R9FMRT813ZSUI","Overall":"good","Content":"Here is the skinny; I would classify myself as an intermediate/pro photographer as an owner of 3 digital cameras and 5 SLRs. I have come to the conclusion after about 9 months with the S50 that it will give you the greatest bang for your buck. Whether you need it for its manual (semi-pro) functions or as just a point and shoot, this is just the camera. It is small and portable, yet very powerful and filled with functions that the average user will never need. It is very durable and has excellent optics, as you will eventually see from your first set of prints. This camera has been out for a while now and you will be able to purchase it at a very reasonable price. You simply cannot buy a comparable camera that even comes close.Read on for more detail.The LCD screen is very bright and easy to see, even in direct sunlight. In my experience with other digital cameras, I would recommend that you apply a screen protector. I have had them replaced on my other cameras due to scratches. They do not make them for cameras, however you can cut one out of any after market PDA screen protector. It does an excellent job protecting your screen from scratches and fingerprints. A must have when you start taking this camera wherever you go; and you will after you fall in love with it as most S50 users have.This camera takes great photo-quality pictures. The reason that I got this camera is because of the 5MP resolution. You will not need that resolution for your average 4x6 or 5x7 print; however it's nice to be able to take a picture at the highest resolution and know that you have flexibility in editing and cropping or even getting a photo-quality 8x10 or 11x14 if you ever need it. Besides, we all have 100+ Gb drives with CD burners, so whenever you want you could burn your photos on a CD/DVD for storage. However, this high resolution comes with a price. It is a necessity that you purchase a high capacity CF card. This all depends on how many photos you take per session. A 512MB card will take a little over 200 photos and ranges from $70-$100.There are those who think that you need a camera with a 4X optical zoom as opposed to the S50s 3X. The 3X vs. 4X zoom is just another selling point. DO NOT PASS THIS CAMERA UP BECAUSE OF THIS! In my professional opinion, that makes little difference to the final product, the print. Keep in mind that the more zoom you use, the more light and stability you need in holding the camera. In other words, you will likely need a tripod to take a decent picture, not to mention better lighting. Bottom line is that the 3X is ample for a camera in this class.My last recommendation is for an after market high-capacity battery. I purchased an 800mAh Lithium-ion for about $35 and it is a vast improvement over the factory supplied one. I used to lug them both with me, but I stopped doing that since I have never had the other one discharge on me before the day is over.One feature that this camera needs is hour/minute indicator of how much battery time is left. The only indicator is a two-minute warning that the battery is almost empty. So if Canon is listening, please put this in the next firmware update. My other gripe with this camera is the lens cover/door. It is flimsy and does not always close as smoothly as it is supposed to.","Date":"January 2, 2004"}
{"Title":"Beware the sliding door of doom","Author":"Maddi Hausmann Sojourner \"madhaus\"","ReviewID":"R27QSCCTSOFIWQ","Overall":"good","Content":"The Canon PowerShot S50 is a terrific small digital camera.  It packs in an amazing array of features, starting with the generous maximum 5 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card).  Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc.  You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both.  There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound!This small camera fits in a purse easily (okay, not a small purse), and doesn't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included).  That means the optical zoom is limited to 3x.  And unfortuately, the S50, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out at 11mm, which is a very wide-angle value.  Even at 3X you will only come in to 55mm, often not as close as you'd expect. There is a digital zoom, but so what?  Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  But getting back to the range, I found it insufficient for shootingacross a large (but crowded) room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem.I agree the sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy.  That's because it can cause problems.  My 3YO niece got ahold of mine and ripped the door off.  I was able to reattach it but now it's like a loose tooth, just waiting to fall off again.  Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it.  I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all.  I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.Then I bought a Canon Digital Rebel, which is an even better camera, but not the same type as the S50 at all.  The latter can fit into a generous shirt pocket; the Digital Rebel is a big ol' digital SLR (single-lens reflex camera, a through-the-lens viewfinder, typically with interchangeable lenses).One of the S50's limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score.  The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue.  Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap.  I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package.  The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images.  The PowerShot S50 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package.  The one provided is fairly limited.  Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots.  The included CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.","Date":"December 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"Excellent Speed vs Feature (Form Factor) Tradeoff","Author":"wcc2","ReviewID":"R31BHNM15JM00G","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my fourth digital camera. After owning two intro models (Olympus D490 and D460) I went in the pursuit of speed. Speed being defined on four dimensions: (1) bootup/startup time, (2) delay between depressing shutter button and digital capture, (3) lag between consecutive shots, (4) lens apeture (for low light conditions). Before the Powershot S50 I was (and still am) using an Olympus C3040, which is the main comparitor for this review. In this price range last year the C3040 was one of the fastest cameras out there due to a 32Mb RAM buffer built into the camera and its F1.8 lens. My sense is that the Powershot S50 and all of its competitors have excellent features - many modes, manual overrides, etc. For the most part, just reading the specs is enough for getting a sense of these features. What is purely experiential - what requires owning and experiencing - is how fast the camera is (on the above four dimensions). The S50 is pretty fast. Bootup about 3 seconds. Delay between pressing shutter button and capture about 1 second. Lag between consecutive shoots about 1 second (I took consecutive shoots using the same fixed composition, flash off, new batteries, repeatedly pressing shutter button very quickly). These speeds are all slightly slower than the C3040. Boot is almost the same, shutter delay almost identical, and S50 was a touch slower between consecutive shoots (after the 6th or 7th shot the S50 was lagging behind). Apeture the Canon has a slower lens (F2.8 vs F1.8). Overall the S50 is a fast camera.Obviously in the S50's favor is form factor (which is one reason why the lens is smaller, leading to a less fast lens (higher F-stop). It is a much smaller package than the C3040, which means that I'll be carrying it around more often.","Date":"May 22, 2003"}

Has standard features plus some pretty nice extras such as:-customizable flash-can change the strength of the flash, helping to prevent washed out pictures which is common with most digital cameras when you use the flash.-flips landscapes pictures that would normally appear sideways. the camera lets you flip these pictures rightside up so you won't have to do it on your computer.-can take panoramic pictures.-the camera is customizable! What does this mean? This camera lets you customize the startup screen. You have an option between clear blue water, evening skyline or a sitting bird. You can change the startup sound, your options include a default theme, science fiction and animal sounds(dog barking or bird chirping). These sounds are designed to presumably match the startup screens but they can be mix and matched. The shutter also has various sounds you can choose from. All these sounds can, of course, be turned off.-this list goes on and on. Check this camera out to see everything.* Superb true true-to-life daytime and night pictures.* Pictures come out crisp and sharp with or without the flash, in brightly lit or darky lit areas.* What you see is what you get. What you see on the LCD screen is usually how the pictures will appear on your computer monitor or when you print them out. The LCD, when you press lightly on the shutter button, will show you actually how the picture will appear once viewed on screen or on paper. So if your LCD has a bright contrast and you are in a dark room, when you press the shutter button lightly, the LCD will adjust itself to the actual lighting of the room. There will be no deception and you won't have to wonder why the pictures look lighter on the LCD than on the computer screen or in print.* Can record mini movies with sound.* Uses compact flash card.* Unbeatable price.There is much, much more that I can add on to this list but you will have get this camera and see for yourself.Negatives:* Joystick navigator takes some getting used to. Very hard to maneuver through the menus resulting in accidently going to the wrong options.* There is no power button. You have to shut the lens' lid to turn off the camera. This makes me nervous. I'm always scared that this will somehow damage the lens.* The macro setting isn't the best. Sometimes the macro pictures can appear blurry.* Uses the very expensive NB-2L rechargable battery as opposed to inexpensive, more common rechargables such as NiMHs or other types. Plus NB-2Ls can only be used with PowerShot S30, S40, S50 cameras and Elura 40mc camcorders. Get the Canon PowerShot S50 if you want superior quality in a small package.","Date":"February 8, 2004"}

The accompanying software is excellent and makes downloads to the computer painless.It takes stunningly good photos, and that's the important thing. The video quality, however, is yucko. Don't buy the camera thinking that you'll take great short clips as part of the package. You won't.Why didn't I give it 5 stars?1)  It is slow on the draw when you snap a pic. Just a little too long for it to capture the scene so that you can move on to another pic.2)  The sliding door on the front is, so far, sturdy but it sure feels wobbly and breakable. I don't care for it.3)  The all-in-one function button in the back is sensitive to the slightest pressure in the wrong direction, especially if you make a selection and then press straight down (the dreaded middle position). Ugh, what an awful idea.4)  Forget the memory card that comes with the camera. Canon, just put the higher-capacity card in the camera. We all know that disk space costs practically nothing, and the card you give us is pathetic (it seems all camera manufacturers do this, and I wish they would just stop the cutesy games on this matter).Bottom line to potential buyers: If I had to do it over again, I'd get the same camera.

{"Title":"Absolutely no camera experience needed","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R24NXOP35HFTHW","Overall":"good","Content":"I had been working on my wife to purchase a digital camera for about 2 years.  So, in that amount of time, I had been doing research and digging to find the best camera.  Also in that time, things have changed considerably.When my wife and I finally decided to buy a camera, I asked her what she wanted.  Two things where placed before me to find in a good digital camera.  These things were small size (so when we visit over seas, it is easily concealable) and great point and shoot capabilities.  With these things in mind, I also wanted something that is going to provide great photos for at least 3 years to come, the ability to take micro-drives, the ability to use AA batteries and lots of manual control.The PS S50 lived up to 90% of all of these things.  It can be set to fully manual for creative control, it is 5.0 megapixels and at superfine compression, is enough to provide me with 8x11 size photos (which I will never use (like I would never have used 640KB of memory 'hehe')), it is fully compatible with CompactFlash type 2 (i.e. microdrives), it can be used in fully automatic mode with 9 auto-focus and auto-exposure zones and takes great photos plus, it's only 4.5in x 2.25in x 1.75in!The one item it didn't match was that it didn't take AA batteries.  This is a big disappointment to me because I had just purchase a number of very high quality rechargeable NiMH batteries for our wireless keyboards and mice.  This is the sole reason I gave it 4/5 stars.  It's that give of deal to me that I can't go to the store and purchase some emergency batteries if something happens to my set.  However, I couldn't find anything that compared to it in another brand and would take the batteries, so, here I am.But, I was able to find a third party extended life battery and that extends the life about another 1/3 to half.  The proprietary rechargeable batteries are becoming the thing, and there are few digital cameras that still take AA's.The fully automatic photos are amazing in bright light and the newly designed flash fills the room with enough light to make it seem light day-time!  But the camera does have some issues with the focusing in lower light situations.  At these times, a tripod almost becomes a necessity to get crisp clear photos.  Which brings me to the fact, yes, it does have a metal tripod mount on it.  Great for many Christmas photos!  Or pictures of you pets (poor sad pets).So, moral of the story, great camera, stupid battery, fits in your pocket, and if you look in the right place, you can find it for $400 right now, plus a third party extended battery for less money than a Canon normal battery.  Defiantly worth the money, plus, it lets me try my hand at creative photography (it ain't good folks).  P.S. It comes with a 32MB Flash card which is a joke if you ask me.  You're going to need to purchase some additional digital film.","Date":"September 28, 2003"}
{"Title":"Wow!","Author":"Snake Plissken","ReviewID":"R2JTQNQFR02Y6K","Overall":"good","Content":"For those of you wanting to take a (giant) leap over the average point-and-shooter (and even if you do not) this camera is your final destination.  I agonizingly researched numerous digital cameras for months and results always seem to conclude that the Canon S50 is highly rated and was a consistent editor's pick.  I am a die-hard Olympus fan with their lens construction, which utilized \"ED\" extra dispersion glass.  My old (now bulky) IS-1 point-and-shooter gave me stunning photos which actually once exceeded a professional wedding photographer's pictures at a cousin-in-law's wedding.  I can safely say that I can easily match those vivid results with the S50.  The features bundled with this camera are immense.  I have yet to get through them all and the journey can only get better.In researching other \"user\" reviews I discovered complaints about the flimsy lens cover/slider door and an LCD screen that scratches easily.  I appreciated that advice and I now exercise caution in the operation of the slider door with no problems so far.  The door seems durable enough to last for the years of use.  As far as the LCD screen damage, as a Pocket PC owner I wisely purchased a package of ten plastic screen protectors to eliminate stylus damage.  I cut one sheet down to size and rubbed it onto the S50's LCD screen.  It works and looks very good and they are easily removable thanks to the use of a light adhesive.  You can purchase them at any local computer products retailer.The battery life is fair and upon the cameras initial use, the built-in memory battery needed to charge off of the removable one, so your first run will drain the battery fast.  After that you should see your performance increase according to your camera's operational settings.  I will however, purchase a spare battery or two as well as the AC and DC adapters.  External card reading and writing devices are a must to conserve power and again, my Pocket PC and laptop are invaluable for this as you can view and edit CompactFlash cards with ease.That said, the world is my oyster and I continue to see the quantum leaping advantages to digital photography.  I'll miss my old IS-1, but not it's bulk and film waste.","Date":"December 25, 2003"}
{"Title":"Fantastic picture quality and value","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RYU9PSNZ4PB2","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture quality and feature set of this camera is fantastic for the price.  I've used it with its underwater case for taking fantastic scuba diving pictures during a Carribean vacation.  There are lots of great features such as automatic mode for simple point&shoot and for the intermediate photographer using manual settings.  Three additional nice modes include: panorama, short video, and rapid shoot (taking multiple shots in rapid succession).  The included software is great for managing pictures and powerful to help enhance any picture.A couple of drawbacks: (1) the sliding lens cover can pop off and (2) battery does not last very long.  A few suggestions: (1) use hi-speed compact flash card (at least 128MB to get about 50 hi-res pictures), (2) definitely invest in an extra battery, (3) when using underwater, make sure to wipe interior lens of underwater case with anti-fog solution before each undertewater outing.","Date":"March 23, 2004"}

{"Title":"AMAZING CAMERA","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3KX3EUVQQINY9","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for more than six months, and after taking more 2,500 photos with this little gem, here is my 2 cents worth. It took me about a full month to get used to all its nuances. But if you are interested simply in \"point and click,?a few hours should do the trick. The  \"auto?setting is more than enough for typical use. You won't regret this purchase.NEGATIVES: (mostly minor):1) Battery meter. You only get a 2-minute warning, and then the camera shuts off. The battery life is pretty short if you use the LCD screen. The battery lasts about 2-4 hours depending the degree of use. (It takes about 1-1.5 hours to recharge).2) Lens cover feels a little flimsy. Enough to cast a slight doubt about its durability. Although I have had no problems with this whatsoever so far.3) It is not the smallest size in its class. In fact, it feels somewhat heavy, if you are used to ultra-small products. If you put the camera in your pants pocket, you definitely feel its weight.  4) There is no way to attach a camera filter to the lens. I had to improvise by manually holding a filter to the lens while I shoot. And the range of exposure time can be a bit wider.  I occasionally need exposure times of a few minutes or longer, and that is not allowed with the S50.5) The auto focus can get \"fooled?in low light situations. You just have to be patient and work with it a little to get it right. Usually a repeat shot is all that is required. (If the subject is far away, I use~ manual focus and set it at infinite?) POSITIVES:1) Picture quality ?this camera takes amazing, breath-taking pictures. I have never seen a camera like this which produces such professional quality photos so consistently! The color balance is simply spectacular. (For color balance, I use \"vibrant?setting). The \"auto?setting does its job admirably most of the time. I use the Canon printer i860, and the 8 x 10s will knock your socks off. Guaranteed. (With a 256 mb card and at \"superfine? setting, you will get 99 photos).2) Quality of product ?this may sound like a non-PC comment and a gross overgeneralization, but I love the fact that this product is not made in China. Many Chinese products that I have had simply broke down after a little use, and I always felt like I was getting ripped off. The camera is a Japanese product and the battery is a Korean product, so both are A-OK in my book.3) Movie making ability ?Although not the highest resolution (and the limit is 3 min), the ability to make a movie is a nice touch. I have used this occasionally, and it is very useful at times!Good luck and have fun","Date":"November 9, 2003"}

Since then, I felt the need to try my hand at it. The old saying goes that it's not the camera, but the photographer that makes the pictures - but when you're starting from scratch, and especially in digital, you'll want something you can grow into.After doing a lot of homework I decided that the S50 was the camera for me. My biggest concerns when deciding on a camera were it's megapixels, features, and portability. 5MP is enough to do enlargements up to a reasonable size with cropping, and even though I haven't made prints as large as I possibly could, I like having the option for when I will eventually need it. The detail in the pictures really stands out when you have them displayed at full size on your computer. All the camera's settings and modes are top notch and as a photographic novice I found it very easy to use all the advanced features without having read the manual. And as far as portability goes, handling it at the store made me appreciate the solid construction that went into it. It fits well in pockets too, though not as well as other cameras.So, why not the flip screen on the A80? The S50 felt much more well built to me. Why not the full fledged features on the G5? The S50 is small enough that I'm willing to take it with me wherever I go, rather than \"when I'm in the mood.\" Why not a comparable Nikon or such? Again, I felt like I got everything I needed in one package with the S50.Do I have any regrets? Not really, though now that I've \"grown into\" the camera, I wish the aperture range was not so limited on full telephoto, but you won't get much out of any of the prosumer cameras in that respect. On camera flash is bad in every way. And I carry a spare battery with me when I'm out - factor that into the cost of your purchase; the battery life is decent, but not great. On the whole, I'm more than satisfied with the camera, but do your research before you settle down on any camera that you feel is right for you.","Date":"January 14, 2004"}

Actually I would give it 41/2 stars. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that, as a compact, it just can't include all of the features a larger camera can give you. (Things like screw on lenses, a diaopter, a flip viewer, a  more powerful flash, remote shutter trip etc.)Picture quality, color, sharpness, etc. is excellent under almost all conditions. Use the i950 Canon printer (so much faster and simpler than the Epson) and their Photo Paper Pro and the printing experience is simple and produces amazing pictures. Not being a pro, I use the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 9 for a photo editor, which is vastly improved over previous versions. The camera feels like a brick,really well put together. It has all the features and options you need in a compact camera. I find that the white engraving on the feature wheel on top of the camera has started to rub out, so I need to look in the viewer to see how to change settings. If you use a tripod you'll have to remove the camera to change the battery or the memory card. Be prepared to spend another $100 for a  compact flash card upgrade. The file sizes on the \"fine\" setting run about 2.5 megs per photo so it's not hard to fill up a 256 meg card. My previous cameras were all in the Nikon Coolpix series up to the 5000 and this little camera beats them hands down. It turns out picture after picture that you can print without a single tweek on the editor. Thats more than I can say for the Nikon.","Date":"August 25, 2003"}

I was unsure about making the switch to digital and was also skeptical about spending that much money on something I may or may not use.  I got the camera so that it could go with my fiance and I to New Orleans, as well as be used in our private life.  So, being a novice I needed something simple to use, with a long battery life and that came with many features.  Also, I needed something that would take crystal clear images.  This camera has truly done all of that and more.  During one week of constant photo taking (over 250 photos), I only changed the battery twice.  I was even able to shoot a short video!  The camera is versatile in that it's a sophisticated as you need it be.  If you don't know a thing about foacl length and proper light, it's a perfect point-and-shoot.  If you're a camera wiz, there are plenty of features to let you get just the right shot.  I've had the camera now for six months and I'm still discovering new features.  It's nearly impossible to take a bad shot with this camera.  I will say, however, that some of the camera's modes take a very steady hand to take, so you might need a tripod.  Considering how many features are on this camera, the price is wonderful.  Especially when compared to similar cameras on the market.  So, whether you're a novice or a camera pro looking to switch to digital, the Canon should be your first choice.  One thing, the memory that comes with the camera is no where near enough.

My two major candidates were the S400 and the S50.  I was unfortunately disappointed in the S400's ability to focus reliably and produce good sharp well saturated pictures while the S50 performed like a champ.  If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S400 vs the S50.  The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation.  I LOVED the look of the S400, but unfortunately it was too small for my large hands and I either couldn't hold it steady or the darn thing wouldn't focus properly even though I set the focus mode on just the center focus square would should have given me substantially more focus control.  This camera is simply beautiful, but for me it just wasn't producing the excellent results I've gotten with the S50.  The S50 offers considerably more user controls than does the S400.  I could have lived without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera was primarily for my wife.  But I couldn't live without reliable focusing.Several have pointed out that since the S400 is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  I'm not sure that I buy this argument since I wouldn't carry either camera in my pocket.  I'm well aware of the glowing reports re the S400 and I sincerely wish it had worked out for me since I love the form and size factor, but at the end of the day picture quality was WAY more important to me than absolute smallness and the S50 just performed better for me.  ON the form and size factor alone the S400 gets the nod, but on the more important function front the S50 just worked better for me.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, it is currently the state of the art.","Date":"March 8, 2004"}

Yes, as in the other reviews, the picture quality is fantastic! The ease of use, the style, the boot up time ... everything is first rate!  But the thing that impressed me the most, is the little, if any, amount of work that needs to be done to these pic's via Photoshop or any other photo enhancing program.  This being my 5th digital camera, I have to say honestly, the other 4 definitely needed some touch-up in Photoshop to make them look better for printing.  Even my Olympus C-4000 zoom, which takes great pic's also, needed some color adjustments and lightening in most photo's.  As for this Canon S50 camera, I've imported them directly into either Photoshop 7 or the software that came with the camera ... and printed them directly in Exif format with no adjustments at all and they print out fantastic!So if you're looking for a camera that takes great pictures WITHOUT having to touch them up in a photo editing program, you will absolutely LOVE this camera!","Date":"August 4, 2003"}

After reading some of the poor reviews on this site I was nervous about purchasing the camera, however after receiving it and taking some pictures, it is all Canon promises and more.  I do get some out of focus pictures now and then but that is primarily due the the camera not being able to obtain an autofocus lock.  Nothing inherently wrong with the camera and I always can override the autofocus with the manual and the pictures then come out excellently.I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants to be able to have the flexibility and quality to take very good pictures in a small format camera.

And a few annoying weaknesses; major redeye problems, an optical viewfinder which only shows 82% of the picture, one second shutter delay and a tiny multi-function switch.  It's very durable; I dented mine dropping it from an overhead train compartment in Japan.  The 32 meg compact flash card included only holds ten pictures at the highest setting but you can buy a 128 meg on the internet for $35.  The very compact battery charger charges Canon's proprietary battery in 80 minutes and works on 110/220 volts.  You can buy a clone battery on the net for $5.95.

Very poor images for a camera that is on the higher end.  Since it was not a researched buy I decided to do my research and found that the Canon S50 had nothing but great reviews.  The reviews were right!  This camera is about as perfect as you can get.  I realized that I wanted a point and shoot camera but also one that would allow good 8x10 pictures, which it does very well.  8x10 prints are flawless.  If you are thinking about spending a few hundred dollars on a digital camera, spend the extra $100 or so and upgrade to the S50 to get 5 MP.  You will be much happier in the long run and will not have to go buy \"another\" camera when one day you are disappointed because you want to blow up a picture and the resolution is too low...Colors are great, very little if any noise, and no bad pictures.  In auto mode I have yet to see a picture come out bad.  The real benefit to this camera is the manual adjustments that can be made.  You will not find that on similar cameras.  This is almost equal to the manual capabilities of a good SLR but you do not have the lense options.  The only down side that I see to this camera is that you will have to read the manual to figure out how to best use all of the preset modes or how to make the manual adjustments.  But, like I said, it auto mode it takes perfect pictures every time.Also, buy at least the 256 MB high speed compact flash cards.  One, they should work a little quicker.  Two, take EVERY picture at the highest resolution and you will have room for just over 100 pictures.  That way you can always reduce resolution later for smaller files.  Also, long day trips with a lot of pic's.... buy another flash card and battery.  The batter actually lasts a long time, especially if you don't use the display constantly, but you can run it down and I am sure you don't want to miss pic's.Happy shopping!","Date":"October 8, 2003"}
{"Title":"A dandy little 5 megapixel workhorse!  Great pictures!","Author":"Roger J. Buffington","ReviewID":"RS1FZH1QGCBUI","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera does exactly what it was designed to do, and it does it well--it takes great pictures from a pretty small and rugged camera body.  The camera is built like a tank, and while not as small as the digital Elph, for example, it easily slips into a coat pocket or whatnot.The picture quality is excellent--the 3X zoom lens on the camera is quite capable of taking very good quality pictures.  Colors are well-saturated and focus is crisp.  This is a dandy little performer--great for taking snapshots and action shots in places or situations where a larger camera might simply be too much trouble.  The pictures this camera is capable of taking will not disappoint.The S50 is a bit more complicated to master than the average small point-and-shoot digital simply because it features a lot of options--unlike many small cameras, this one provides a lot of flexibility for settings.  Don't want the flexibility?  No problem--set it on automatic mode for auto-everything, or \"program\" mode for auto-most things.  I find that I do almost all my shooting in program mode.  However, it is occasionally very nice to be able to play with apature or speed settings to achive desired effects.Battery life is good, especially if you go easy on using the rear LCD.  One accessory most users will want is a spare battery--for trips this is necessary since the camera uses only a proprietary battery.  The good news--the supplied charger can fully charge a battery in about an hour.At 5 Megapixels, this camera is capable of producing good-sized blow up pictures, and you can shoot in RAW mode too; not many small cameras offer this feature.  I did a lot of research before selecting the S50 as my \"point and shoot\" pocket camera, and I've been uniformly pleased.","Date":"October 6, 2003"}

It's nice not to have to worry about accidentally turning on the camera, but my first S50 had a malfunctioning sliding door (it wouldn't open completely), and I had to exchange it for another one, which has worked fine.Second, the exposure settings and picture resolution out of the box are not optimal considering the 5 megapixel CCD sensor, which is one of the major selling points of the camera. My shots were consistently underexposed, and the low resolution settings seemed more designed to fit on the woefully small included compactflash card than to provide good shots. It was easy to change the settings through the extensive menu, but with a point and shoot one expects good pictures without having to tinker with the settings. On the plus side, the camera is very feature-rich, and the image quality is good once the settings are tweaked. Also, the small size makes it easy to carry around, which is the main reason I chose it over the larger G5. A major draw is the ability to save images in the RAW format, which many other manufacturers lack. The RAW format can be thought of as the name suggests - a \"raw\" image without any noticeable compression that might degrade quality. In comparison, a JPEG is considered a \"lossy\" format, in which one sacrifices some detail in order to have a smaller file size. Once I bought a 512MB compactflash, I saved all my images as RAW files and adjusted them on the computer.The included Arcsoft and Canon software are not really very good, and you'll get much better mileage from Adobe Photoshop/ Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro.To summarize,Pros:Small sizeGood picture quality once default settings are changedRAW image format capabilityFeature-richCons:Mechanical sliding door can give problemsOut-of-the-box image settings less than optimalSlow shutter speedInadequate Compactflash card includedNeed to open battery door to get at Compactflash cardSo-so included software","Date":"March 20, 2004"}
{"Title":"Good point & shoot digital","Author":"Zachary P. Beane \"xach\"","ReviewID":"RKMY7P8OY0TBC","Overall":"good","Content":"This was my first new digital camera in the last three years. In that time, the feature set and usability of a moderately-priced digital camera have improved dramatically.Just take the issue of reviewing your photos. On my old Olympus 3040, you had to switch the camera dial to \"Review Mode\" to look at the pictures you just took. If you wanted to take a picture while reviewing, you had to switch it back quickly, hope you flipped it to the right shooting mode dial setting, and shoot. With the Canon, you enter review mode by flicking a spring-loaded switch. Review mode can always be instantly cancelled by pointing at a subject and pushing the shutter release halfway down. You're instantly back in the right shooting mode. It sounds like such a simple thing, but it makes the camera much easier to use.That's just one of the nice things about the S50. It also has orientation detection (it knows if you held the camera vertically or horizontally when shooting), multiple focus points, and quick startup and shutdown (just open or close the front panel).Since it's in a small body, there are some sacrifices. The lens is not very fast; expect to use the flash or a tripod when there's not a lot of light. The flash is also underpowered, having difficulty lighting a scene after about 12 feet. MacOS X's iPhoto doesn't seem to support the automatic image rotation or RAW files.However, the image quality, convenience, and the many little features done right make this a great camera for casual use in many situations.","Date":"October 27, 2003"}

They are great.  We took one backpacking in South America for 2 months and it survived and never gave us any problems.

{"Title":"Great pictures from a tiny camera!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RWGIKSQYLY4NX","Overall":"good","Content":"As an avid amateur photographer, I love my Canon EOS SLR, but wanted to buy a digital camera for traveling and family snapshots. Since a digital SLR body was out of my price range, i researched maybe 15 compact digitals before settling on the S50. I'm thrilled with my purchase and would recommend this camera even to folks who, like me, are used to higher-end SLRs. The S50 offers an incredible array of features and options in an improbably small package. I've had it for about six weeks and have yet to take advantage of all the bells and whistles. Although the camera offers options galore, its controls are pretty intuitive. And despite its myriad features, you can use it right out of the box in its \"Auto\" mode.Its color fidelity is stunning -- even with magentas, which some digital cameras don't capture well. Its automatic white balance is also superb; it produces none of those ugly casts you get with cheaper digital cameras. If you prefer to set the white balance yourself, though, this camera gives you plenty of flexibility.I've had very good results with the focus. The couple of blurry pics I've gotten were probably my fault because I didn't give the camera enough time to focus. The focus lock seems pretty quick - comparable to that on my SLR.There are a couple of areas in which this camera doesn't perform as well as my SLR (an unfair comparison, but worth mentioning). One is the slight, occasional shutter delay. This can be annoying but it's not the end of the world for travel and family shots. If you're big into anything that involves split-second action, though, I'd recommend you stick to an SLR.I must also echo other reviewers' comments on the flimsiness of the lens cover. I contemplated returning the camera because of this but was so impressed with the quality of the pictures that I instead resolved to handle the cover with kid gloves. It's helpful to note that you don't have to use the lens cover at all, if you're worried about it... the camera powers down automatically after a while, and you can wake it up again by depressing the shutter. (Of course, this option leaves the lens exposed to dust and scratches...)That said, the S50 offers a couple of huge advantages over film cameras. One is its performance in low-light settings. I've been amazed at the S50's ability to capture pictures indoors, without a flash.  No funky purple ghosting, either!And I love the LED screen that's built into the back of the camera. It has pretty good resolution so you can tell what's in focus, and you can adjust its brightness depending on whether you're shooting indoors or out. It's great to be able to compose your shot without having to mush your glasses against a tiny viewfinder, and it's even better to be able to review your photos at the end of the day.The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and intuitive to use (on a Mac, anyway - can't vouch for the PC version!). The 32mb memory card that comes with the camera, on the other hand, is inadequate... I'd recommend buying a card with at least 128mb of storage.  An extra battery couldn't hurt, either!On the whole, I think this is one of the best compact digital cameras on the market today, and certainly in its price range. I'd expected to compromise some image quality in moving from film to digital, but am surprised and delighted to find that's not the case. If I had my choice to make over, I'd buy this camera again.","Date":"April 7, 2004"}

I was interested in picture quality above all else, and many of the reviews I read use this as a benchmark to which to compare other cameras. Sure enough, the pictures that I've gotten look amazing both on the computer and printed out.  My other concern was size... I never use my very fancy 35mm because it is just too big to carry around.  While this camera is not the smallest in its class, it is the smallest one at that resolution to offer so much manual control. I don't care how small a camera is... if I can't fine tune the settings to get the picture that I want, it's not worth carrying it.  Some of the other cameras in the same class don't even allow you to control the flash, and very few offer full manual control, while this camera offers everything you can think of and more (not to mention a variety of automatic settings for quick snapshots).  So, if you want HIGH quality pictures and know that you can't get this consistently without getting to know your f-stops and shutter speeds, but you also want a camera that fits in your pocket, you can't go wrong with this camera.","Date":"October 28, 2003"}

I held off buying a new camera for a long time, waiting till digital camera technology evolved to SLR quality.  I finally thought this was it, and made the plunge,and am not disappointed.The photo-quality is astonishing even inauto mode (I havent experimented much yet with the manual settings), and the camera is exceptionally quick.  I am able to reshoot within a second even at high resolution. The camera excels in outdoor/sunshine where minute details (blades of grass, each strand of hair) can be made out.  Colors are brilliant and true.Battery is OK and lasts enough for 3 to 4 photo rounds (enough to fill up my 256MB card) and Canon did a great job in writing intuitive software.  It is also a great toy given the amount of manual control it gives, at the same time fitting in a pocket easily.TIPS:Initially some shots came fuzzy, but the trick is to let the autofocus do its job fully (half-press the button).  Flash is also a bit weak, but there may be some manual settings that would strengthen this.Buy a huge memory card. You will be using this camera a lot.","Date":"June 26, 2003"}
{"Title":"One Year of Great Pictures, but Many Limitations","Author":"Richard R. Zellner \"ttdragster\"","ReviewID":"R2JOIS8Z0FZFEW","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been meaning to give this camera a fair review since I bought it last spring, so I spent some time trying all of the features and testing its limitations. While this and most similar digital cameras take some very clear shots, there are too many cases where digital distortion and blurred photos are the result of the current state of digital camera technology. I bought this camera over some less expensive models in hopes to take advantage of the many manual features the camera has to offer. Most highly of these, I looked forward to manual focus. As far as I'm concerned, this feature is just not worth the frustration of using. The same goes for some of the other manual settings available on the camera. It's much easier to get a great picture using the manual controls on the standard 35mm camera. While I'm very happy with this camera for it's quality in construction and ease of general use, I don't reccommend this camera for those who are interested in the manual features. If you find a comparible digital camera without the manual settings, I would choose that one instead. If you want control over your pictures, either buy a digital camera over $1000 or stick to the trusty 35mm for the time being. You could always get a cheaper digital camera on the side for quick picture taking.","Date":"April 5, 2004"}

We played around with them and our own cameras and made some comparisons.  First a few comments about F&F (features and feel).  The S50 has a very solid, well made feel to it, especially considering the very reasonable price - you can get it for well under the $600 retail pricetag.  Second, this guy has many features you won't get without spending quite a bit more money.  For example, the integration of the exposure mode controls are very logical and functional, with a very usable manual exposure mode and wide exposure compensation.  The included software has an image stitching capability for assembling panoramas and it works fine.  The autofocus system works well and has some interesting options for shooting difficult subjects, such as when the object of interest is off-center.  The image processor is called DiG!C and supposedly enhances the image quality beyond what you'd expect from a 5 MB CCD.  We compared images from the S50 to our Olympus C-50 and our Sony F707.  The S50 did quite well, in some cases looking slightly sharper than the C-50, but in general falling short of the F707.  Note that the F707 retailed for over $1000 and has a large Zeiss lens which I expect is a significant contributing factor.  One more thing - the C50 is easy to use - I picked up on most of the controls intuitively.","Date":"January 19, 2004"}

I am a serious amateur photographer, and I got it because it was the _only_ all-manual (somewhat) pocketable digital camera when I got it. The flexibility of this camera is crucial! And I love the 'intervalometer' which allows me to make time-lapse movies of things such as beautiful sunsets.The bads:The markings on the selector wheel have completely rubbed off. I have to look on-screen to guess what mode I am in.To push the selector SET button in without pushing left or right requires just the right touch. I much prefer separate select button as on some other models.The lens cover also requires a certain touch to close it properly, since it doesn't stay in its track perfectly. This is easily learned, unlike the selector button.Special-purpose battery is expensive! Why not use AAs?Only focuses up to 10cm.  Macros are not that macro.Focusing close in low light is virtually impossible, even with manual focus.To have a shutter sound a second after releasing the shutter button is worthless. It makes taking pictures from a moving vehicle very hard to time.Some more GOODS:  It is surprisingly sensitive, and takes excellent night shots of things like christmas lights, or shots from indoor lighting even without a tripod.Sound annotation and movies are very handy!The flash is very flexible, with 1st or 2nd curtain, variable brightness.The digital zoom (from 3x to 12x) is quite good.It is pretty solid.

Prior to purchasing the digital camera, I did a hefty amount of research to ensure myself that I was indeed purchasing a product that would last. After comparing countless cameras to one another through the Internet and shopping centers, I settled on the Powershot S50.The camera (overall) is incredibly easy to operate, and provides the user with an immense amount of features to explore and expand upon. I quickly learned how to decide on a specific shooting mode for each shot, without much fuss. I also found it very simple to become comfortable and confident while shooting manually with the S50.This digital camera produces vibrant colors and crisp images with almost every photograph or snapshot taken. The automatic white balance (with or without setting it yourself) compliments each shot, and allows for flexibility. There is rarely a need to adjust anything more than the brightness and contrast of a photograph in Photoshop, which is not the case for many other digital cameras. S50 is also capable of functioning well without a flash in a low-lit environment!The body of the S50 is a perfect size, sturdy, and survived (with only one small scratch) a dreadful fall on the kitchen ceramic tile. Also, the LED screen placed on the backside of the camera allows the user to see what exactly they are photographing.There is no need to worry in regards to loading S50s software on a Mac, or PC. Both are \"user-friendly\" and will not be found troublesome!Aside from all of the upsides to purchasing the camera, there are, of course, minor (but worth mentioning) issues I was and am not satisfied with. I have not experienced anything negative with the sliding lens cover as other reviewers have, but can agree with its (occasionally) slow reaction time. I have missed a shot I desired to capture on more than one occasion because S50 did not react quickly enough.Along with this, I have and continue to struggle with the usage of the flash. Photographs either appear too bright or not bright enough. I have yet to settle upon middle ground with S50. However, Photoshop and other photography programs can easily adjust this issue if needed (along with the commonly complained about red eye). The battery life is also an issue to struggle with. It is best to carry another with you, as the camera will not specifically indicate when it will be out of battery power.I would recommend this camera to anyone in need of a reliable buy, as well as a larger memory card (mine being 256MB). You will have a point-and-shoot camera as well as a semi-pro manual camera combined into one, with a terribly affordable price for all of its functions.","Date":"December 5, 2004"}

{"Title":"Consider Your Needs Before Purchasing.....","Author":"john chang","ReviewID":"R2K5G4KWBX8PAD","Overall":"good","Content":"Before purchasing a digital camera, sit-down and consider your needs. 1. Are you just getting started out in digital photography?  This particular camera has a lot of bells and whistles but if you don't take the time to learn the features then it may be a bit of an overkill. The manual has a nice layout, but for the amateur photographer, its not going to be enough explain the functions in detail.2. How portbable do you want the camera to be?This is a medium sized camera. Not quite small and light enough where you feel comfortable slipping it into your pocket and heading on out. But at the same time, not a big contraption that is bulky and difficult to manage. Recommendations:1. Buy a bigger memory Card - With a 5 megapixel camera, I highly recommend getting at least a 256mb memory card.2. Buy a USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader - While the camera comes with a cable that connects to your computer for downloading images, the USB 2.0 Reader is lightning fast. For example, suppose that a download may take 5 minutes with the supplied cable, that same download will only take 45 seconds with USB 2.0. If you plan on taking a lot of digital pictures, then this item is recommended. Just be sure to check if you computer is USB 2.0 compatible.3. Buy an extra battery - More than likely that one supplied with the camera will not be enough if you plan on taking a lot of pictures during a trip. At least with the back-up, you can snap away without having to worry if you have enough battery power.4. Consider buying image editing software- This will give you more control over the finished product. You will be able to crop images, brighten them, sharpen them, take out the red-eye, etc...Again, if you are not familiar with such software, it may take some time to learn. Conclusion: This camera takes awesome pictures for the most part. At 5 megapixels, the images come out clear and detailed. There is a bit of a red-eye problem, and the flash is not very powerful. This camera offers a lot of features, but unless you are willing to sit there and learn what each function does, you may not need it. Portability was an important factor for me while wanting to preserve camera performance, and so I purchased this camera. If I could do it again, I probably would have bought 2 cameras instead. One really small camera like the Canon SD10, so that I can take it anywhere, and then purchase one bigger camera like the Canon G3. I figured that this camera is in between and compromised. Now I kind of regret it. So take your time and think about what kind of settings you will use the camera in and what functions you really need.","Date":"July 10, 2004"}

For the past four months, I've been continuously shooting pictures. I've carried the camera with me literally every moment of every day and I have probably taken about 5000 pictures with it so far. Prior to this, I was not a frequent picture taker. Additionally, this is my first digital camera.Overall, I am extremely satisfied. The camera takes beautifully detailed and rich images. On the superfine, large setting, it is possible to make large prints (12 x 12) with no noticible deterioration in picture quality. I previously shot on Fine, large but noticed some deterioration in quality on a similarly sized print, so I switched to the higher quality setting.The main weaknesses of this camera are the shutter delay, the focusing and the zoom. Between the shutter delay and the time required for auto-focusing, you can end up with a shot that is different from the one you composed. The zoom is a source of frustration for me. It just isn't sufficient to get the pictures you want (composed the way you want) when a subject is further than 10 feet or so away. I think both of these issues are endemic to this class of camera, so this doesn't detract from my appreciation of the camera.This camera has many options and really serves as a learning tool. It's simple enough to be used by a total novice as a pure point and click camera, but also offers enough control to start to learn about more sophisticated ways of taking photos. There's aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual settings.Other pluses to this camera are the fact that it is fairly small and non-descript. Many people are surprised to discover that it is a digital. That's good in my mind, because it makes it less stealable.Before I bought this camera I was a very vapid and infrequent photographer. Now I'm really into taking photos and interested in the process of taking photos. I feel like after using this camera for a few years I will be ready to move up to an SLR.I recommend this camera without reservation, however you should be aware that I am not an experienced photographer, nor do I have experience with any other digital cameras.","Date":"June 11, 2004"}

I'm a 100% happy camper.  Still trying to find out all these features that come with the little one.  The best in the market!","Date":"July 2, 2003"}

Canon's been having problems putting five megapixels on such a small sensor like the ones used on the S50 and S500 (they use the same sensor).  Check out the online review at dcresource(dotcom).  Why buy a five megapixel when you get better image quality and smaller file sizes with the 4MP version of the same camera?  I ended up buying a brand spankin' new S45 on closeout from Amazon for 2/3 of what these sell for.I decided to get the S45 instead of the S400 so I could have a camera that I would grow into and one that allows shooting in RAW mode.  I haven't been disappointed, I love my camera.Let the members of the upgrade of the month club have their new 5MP toy, and be waiting to take their \"old\" camera off their hands, or buy a new one at a fire sale price.","Date":"May 9, 2004"}

{"Title":"UNBELIEVABLE image quality; never look back after buying it!","Author":"Brad Cutchogue \"Brad\"","ReviewID":"R1ST3ZBJ7ANHDX","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm an old SLR user from way back, and always KNEW it took a big lense to get a great image on film.  This little take-along has such a teentsy lense I figured I'd be sacrificing clarity for the convenience of a snapshot camera I could carry in my jeans pocket.  No way - this little package makes 8x10's as crisp and clear as my old 5-pound Pentax K2.  The color is saturated and with the $89 Canon i560s printer I bought at the same time, I get glossy prints with perfect color balance and saturation - and so easy.  You don't even need to turn on the PC to print - the camera menu drives the printer via the included USB cable.  You can even crop and rotate!I especially love being able to show pictures and video clips on the TV.  I carry that adapter cord in my mini zipper case because a large TV screen beats 4x6 glossies any day.Warnings/issues:1) The LCD screen on the back is fragile.  It scratches very easily.  It's also too dim to see in bright sunlight, so changing to the brighter LCD output setting has to be done BEFORE you get in full sun.  Catch-22.3) Buy a LARGE and high-speed compact flash card.  I shoot everything in high resolution so I can blow up whatever shot I like the looks of.  At 2Mb per image, it's very easy to fill a card up.  I usually shoot with a 512Mb Viking which writes each shot to card in about 1.5 seconds, and can store hundreds of shots.  I just cleaned that card off, with 185 shots and assorted movies!  Also, I just ordered a much faster Sandisk Ultra-II with 256Mb of space.  It should be interesting to see how much faster it writes.  Transfer to the PC via USB 1.0 cable won't speed up though - the USB 1.0 limits you on any card regardless of the card's read speed.  Also, a spare card isn't a luxury - if your one and only card dies, you have no camera.  Amazon.com has the best price on the web for that 256 Ultra-II card, by the way.Two complaints:1) They should've put a little timer symbol by the button that opens the menu that includes the self-timer function.  It's so commonly used, it should have its own button.2) Same thing for red-eye.  To turn it on/off I have to go into the menu.  A button next time, OK Canon?Would I buy this S-50 again?  Yes.  In a New York minute!","Date":"June 17, 2004"}

Happily, after playing around with it, I loved this camera.Pluses:1. Optics are crisp and sharp.2. Image quality is great.  5MP is more than any point and shoot casual photographer will ever need.3. Manual mode is a great addition.  You can shoot in aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual exposure modes.  Pretty nice when you want to get a long exposure for a nifty waterfall shot or to add a sense of motion to a sports/action shot.4. Nice finish that doesn't wear away easily like most point and shoot cameras in this class.5. Great auto-focusing and manual-focus controls.6. 3 minute movie mode.  Lots of cameras in this class cap it at 1 minute.Minuses:1. The little sliding door on the front to turn the camera on and off can become flimsy if this camera is used often.  I've had 2 friends that have had to get this part of their camera repaired.2. Great when it came out, but there are many smaller 5MP cameras on the market now.  This camera definitely feels bulky, but you can't hold this against the camera.  When this came out, it was the smallest 5MP out there.3. The flash is WAAAAAY TOO POWERFUL.  I hate using this camera at night because the pictures always tend to be washed out.  You can use photoshop and apply a adjust exposure filter and the images turn out looking great.  But that's an extra step.  I'm confused as to how Canon overlooked this.  I know 4 people with this camera, and this is everyone's major gripe.Overall, from my experience, my guy friends tend to like this camera.  Most of the women I know don't as it feels a bit too big to them.  If you can get this camera used, I'd definitely recommend it as it'll serve you well for a couple of years.","Date":"August 28, 2004"}

{"Title":"Canon's best Point and Shoot ever","Author":"Antoni Scott","ReviewID":"R2M7ID75JRP04R","Overall":"good","Content":"Point and shoot camera's are a dime a dozen. Figuring out which one even comes close to being good is difficult at best. I came across this camera purely by accident when a friend of mine lent me his Canon Powershot S45. Image quality was stunning !!! and I have several 16x20 wall pictures to prove it.  It has everything that a professional photographer could ask for in a \"Point and Shoot\" camera. Manual operation allows the operator to dial in the exact exposure that the light meter may miss ( by the way, the light meter is more accurate than on my Pro-Canon 5D, 20D and 10D !!!!). It also shoots in RAW giving me a two f/stop exposure advantage over JPEG. Although the Exposure Compensation option is somewhat pointless, you can use it. I don't see the need for exposure compensation since an under/over metered shot may be different every time you shoot. Shooting in manual makes exposure compensation unnecessary. More important is the flash compensation, I can dial in flash power from full to 2/3 to 1/3. nice for correct fill flash. Most important to me, in this camera, is Manual, RAW and image quality.The only thing I don't like about this camera is that stupid door that you have to slide over to extend the lens. It looks and is flimsy and is prone to breakage. I have a Canon S45 and the door is coming off. Reliability is tops on the shutter. I have put 500,000 shots through it and it still works. I always shoot in ISO 50, as image quality drops dramatically in 100 and is lousey in 400. But ISO 50 is stunning, colors are right on.Canon should stop fooling around with all these joke point and shoot cameras and just re-introduce the S45 or S50 ( basically the same) . It reminds me on the cell phone mania. I would suggest that they just re-introduce this one but eliminate the door problem.","Date":"November 10, 2009"}

When you slide it one way, it turns the camera on and then you slide it back to turn it off. I bought this camera about 3 years ago and several months ago, when I closed the lens cover after snapping some pictures, I felt it go past the stop point it usually did. Then I noticed the lens cover had become loose. It is even looser now and the camera is still working but I have to be very careful with it. I am afraid it is only a matter of time before it stops working thanks to the loose lens cover. Local camera shops send out digital cameras to be repaired and Canon will not even look at it for less than $150 since it is out of warranty. I will eventually buy a new digital camera and then maybe I will take the chance of looking at this thing myself by taking it apart. It could be just some little thing that could be tightened up, but taking it apart could also ruin the camera for all I know.","Date":"March 19, 2007"}

Nonproprietary memory (uses CF cards).  Newer Canons use SD cards mostly (I believe).2.) Flexibility: sized slightly larger than a compact (and quite a bit heaver), but full functioned.  I was coming from a 35mm SLR and wanted to have some control over my shots without shelling out a few thousand for a digital SLR (at that time).3.) Good optics.  Don't remember which review I read that tested the optical characteristics of the camera[...] but it was among the best of the time.What I didn't like:1.) Bulk: It's a bit heavy and too bulky for a pocket.2.) Proprietary battery.  Life is decent, however.  I can usually get a full day's shooting on one battery.  I have a backup \"just in case\" that I have only had to use on really heavy shooting days (over 150 shots or so).It's survived a number of trips with me around the world and I love the thing.

It has a DURABLE metal casing.  I have dropped this camera numerous times on the concrete (including the first time I took it out of the package) and usually carry it jammed in my purse with my keys, mechanical pencils, you name it.  I've also taken pictures in the rain, which I don't recommend, but it's held up so far!  Mine is horribly scratched and dinged but absolutely no problems yet.  I do recommend an LCD protector.2. Sharp, clear pictures.  I've submitted pictures to galleries and miscellaneous publications; they've never had problems with resolution as long as it hasn't been much over 8x10 (but it's advertised to be ok up to 10x11).3. Intuitive controls. Lots of buttons & dials, but you'll pick it up quick or you can just ignore them all, and point & shoot on \"auto\".  You'll still get great pictures.3. Value.  At this point in time, this almost-professional quality MSRP $500 camera can be found online (NEW) at around $220. If you're looking for a Point & shoot that has some extended capabilities and isn't a clunky EOS SLR, this is pretty portable.A few cons:1.  Weight.  It is relatively heavy compared to other point-and-shoots.  I always use the strap to keep from dropping it, which I've done more than a few times.  It's not as small as the S500s which is a bummer.2. Manual capabilities occasionally tough to find.  As an amateur photographer, I like to use \"auto\" a lot but when I do use the manual focus/etc. it's not always easy to figure out where the appropriate menus are.3. Tiny viewscreen.  Nothing like getting home and realizing that the pictures that initially seemed so sharp and clear on the screen are blurred and out of focus in real size.  But this happens with most (if not all) little digital cameras.4. Night resolution.  Blah.  Has a \"night\" mode which is servicable but not that great.I love this camera and will definitely buy another Canon after all is said and done. In 1 1/2 years, my camera has been around the US/international scene and has taken 5400+ pictures.  It has held up like a champ!  I totally recommend the S50, even for photography amateurs.

That is why I like this camera.  The quality of the pictures are quite good (often, bracketing and having a big memory card helps this further) and the durable metal body and small size makes it ideal for traveling.  My only major gripe is the battery indicator.  The camera doesn't give you a good indication of how much more battery power is left.  A second battery is almost a necessary convenience.Obviously, the pictures taken from this are not as good as the SLR's, but often those cameras do not fit so easily in your pocket.  Having easier access to a camera makes it easier for me to take spur of the moment pictures.  In addition, the s50 does have some remarkable manual features.  Some are a bit gimmicky, but the basic manual features, even a manual focus (kind of a pain to get used to at first) are available.

It was my first digital, but the 2nd digital Canon in our household (husb has Canon S110 Elf - another great *LITTLE* camera!).  This 5 mp camera is loaded with features and creates stunningly crisp images.  It will take me a long time to ever use / figure out how to use them all.I have 3 complaints, but they are all minor:  First, I don't care for the slide-lens-door-open-to-turn-on-camera feature.  I agree with another reviewer, it seems like it could break eventually.  Second, the video only shoots at 15 frames per second.  This information was not easy to find - in fact, it wasn't until we shot the video that we were able to know fps on this one.  It's great that it will shoot for 3 full minutes, compared to our other Canon's 15 seconds, but I'd take less time and more fps.Third, you can't zoom while shooting video.  Again, a very, very minor complaint.All in all, I'd buy another one in a second.  It would be nice eventually to see them put the fold-away lcd panel on this model like the G5 has, but maybe one day.  At Amazon's great price, you just can't beat this camera!

The lens is fully protected by the design, which is easy to work with. It uses compact flash cards, which are easily available and will fit in the 10D I plan on getting sometime in the next year. It's got tons of features: it can act as a point and shoot, as well as allowing an impressive amount of manual manipulation.The setting to allow B&W;, sepia, vivid, and others is particularly cool, as well as the night-shot setting. The flash has three settings, one of which is off, which is a great thing.Because it's so small and light, I take it nearly everywhere with me. You will obviously want to get a bigger flash card than the camera comes with, but once you have that you can shoot and shoot, and discard the garbage shots, and never have to worry about film again. My only issue with the camera is that I've had a lot of trouble installing the software, and canon's tech support has proven to be absolutely USELESS. Most people will likely have no problems at all.

Battery was replaced to something higher five years ago, but original still holds a perfect charge.  The only problem is that the higher ISO's are noisy and lower ISO's by nature are slower.  So, flash photography tends to expose the foreground and leave the background black.  50 speed, f/8 yields very clear results if you can stand long exposures.

{"Title":"A nice digital camera","Author":"eau","ReviewID":"R1W929M6MBAA9L","Overall":"good","Content":"Canon PowerShot S50 is a nice little digital camera with 5 megapixel and 3X optical zoom. It has a load of exposure features from fully automatic to fully manual. It takes high quality pictures in JPG or RAW format with normal, fine or superfine resolutions. The only drawback is the focusing being a little slow. It is also sluggish under low light conditions. The rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery doesn't last long (never got it to go longer than 100 shots under normal shooting conditions with the LCD screen on) but can be recharged within an hour.

It is great for active people and easily tucks into a pocket, purse or diaper bag.  I prefer the viewfinder over the screen display but love that it has both.  Recommend buying another battery (not much warning) and definately another card because of the file sizes (I got a 512 MB). Don't forget a card reader if you need one. At this point, I have not used the enclosed software.  I bought the camera immediately before an unexpected trip and am using another program just because I already knew it.Two of my friends have already bought the same camera.  My last digital was an early Nikon Coolpix which always seemed to have trouble.  This Canon has run smoothly since Day 1 and has taken about 1400 pictures in the last 6-7 months.

Unfortunately it didn't cope too well with the damp weather in NZ, or maybe I handled it a bit roughly, but it stopped working (and no camera shop would even look at it - sending it to Canon from abroad wasn't an option so I missed out on lots of pictures for about 1 month of travelling). Apparently the problem was with the CF chamber (one pin got bent by just slotting in the card) and Canon UK charged me 200 for the repair after my return to Ireland.Anyway, in summary:Good points:- great quality pictures- easy to use- good movieclips with audio (although limited to 3 mins - why?)- CF cards are easy to find, relatively cheap (especially in Asia) and compact- the battery life, compared to other compact digicamera, is excellent (especially compared to the Canon Elph 400, which my travel companion had), but it'd be wise to get a spare battery and keep it charged when taking a lot of pictures in one session- the sofware supplied is quite good- the lens is bigger than in most compact digicamera, resulting in better focus and detailsBad points:- the camera is heavy for its size and a bit bulky- the sliding door on the front is a bit flimsy and sometimes doesn't slot in at the first attempt; also it takes a while to activate the camera- the silver-coloured buttons look very worn out (although my camera was used a lot in its first 4 months), but at least the black body stays black (the Delph silver case doesn't stay silver for long!)- the flash is a bit too strong (hence red eyes and bleached out photos in the dark or semi-darkness), even at the lowest setting- the LCD screen is ok, but it scratches easily (there seems to be a hard plastic cover over it to protect it which can be good)Overall, it's a good camera for its price, but I will probably choose a lighter version with the same size lens when upgrading","Date":"August 18, 2004"}

{"Title":"good, but not great","Author":"Jeffrey S. Bonwick","ReviewID":"R245GBYC8M3D15","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: fast; sturdy; intuitive; built-in mic for movie mode; sliding lens cover means no lens cap to loseCons: very poor macro mode; disappointing auto-focusMy first real camera was a Canon EOS Rebel.  It was supposed to be a great camera, but I found that its auto-focus never focused quite right.  Close, but never as good as I could do manually.I recently bought the Canon PowerShot S50 for my 7-year-old son, who has demonstrated a real gift for photography.  It's a great match for him because it's small (so it fits his hands well), it's easy to use, and it's very well constructed.  Unfortunately, like my old EOS Rebel, this Canon's auto-focus system is weak.  When it happens to focus just right, the pictures are great, and you really get 5MP worth of resolution.  But that's all too rare.  My Nikon Coolpix 990 (without question the best camera I've ever owned) is only 3MP, but in real-life shooting situations it gets better resolution than this 5MP Canon does.  Keep this in mind: getting the wrong focus (or shaking the camera) by just 1 pixel in each direction reduces the effective resolution by 4x.  So getting the focus perfect is *critical* for the 5MP to matter.  Even minor errors send you into sub-megapixel territory.Also, if you care about macro mode, look elsewhere.  It's really quite bad compared to other digitals.  It can't get nearly as close as the Coolpix 990, and again, it has trouble fosusing.On the positive side, the exposure is generally good, the color is accurate, and the movie mode is surprisingly good.  There's a bit of \"Max Headroom\" effect because it's only 15 fps, but it's so easy to use that we actually *take* movies now, whereas our old camcorder just gathers dust because it's too bulky to lug around, and dealing with tape is such a hassle.Overall, a nice product with much to recommend it, but check out the focusing issue yourself before you buy.  Maybe it's just me.  But my next camera will be a Nikon.","Date":"June 23, 2003"}

Very annoying that there is no battery meter, so get a spare battery to keep with you if you plan to be taking lots of photos. The lens cover binds a little and seems flimsy but has held up so far. Be sure to upgrade the capacity with a larger Compact Flash card, the card that comes with the camera has limited space. It takes a while to get used to the shutter action. It can take a full second for shutter to open after the button is pressed, this can play havoc with action shots. In spite of the list above, the quality of images is outstanding. The camera sometimes overexposes images in bright light, but this is easy to compensate for. Overall an excellent camera.","Date":"August 8, 2003"}
{"Title":"Inconsistent Focusing Ability is Disappointing","Author":"Andrew Senske","ReviewID":"R3R6FM0JRGJ5A","Overall":"bad","Content":"When this camera focuses accurately the resulting images are really amazing.  However, a vast majority of approximately 1000 pictures we've taken so far are out of focus.  Switching to center-point focus doesn't help.  If only one feature on a camera works it should be the auto-focus.  Do the five-star reviewers have low standards, or is my camera defective?  I noticed one other review that mentions terrible focusing ability, so I don't think it's just me.On the brighter side, the movie mode is surprisingly good and produces nice, sharp movies.  However, zooming is not possible in movie mode.  My five-year-old, 0.8 megapixel Sony Mavica allows zooming in movie mode.  C'mon Canon.  Get with the program.Battery life is good and charging time is brief.  I don't have a backup battery or the AC adapter kit and I haven't had any reason to need them yet.The flash is nice and bright and allows for pretty decent indoor photos even in relatively low-light situations.  The AF-assist light probably could have been left off the camera altoghther.  If you need it to focus in really low-light you don't have a good chance at getting a good picture.  Don't expect any red-eye reduction from it either (same AF-assist light stays on during image capture when red-eye reduction feature is on).  In fact, unless your subject is willing to incur retinal damage by looking directly into the stunningly bright light, there is no real chance of reducing red-eye at all.  Big disappointment.  Canon needs to utilize the strobe-flash technique for red-eye reduction.Bottom line:  It's easy to look at the very best images this camera can produce and believe it to be a great camera.  However, when you end up with pictures which are out of focus and when everyone in them has red-eye, you won't be thinking of the great picture the camera produced yesterday.","Date":"July 5, 2003"}

The camera astounded me.  It is small and light yet well built.  It is easy to turn on and off using the front lens cover that is built in.  The images are exceptional.  I made 8x10s on an Epson printer with no manipulation that I think are better than images from film from a lab.  The Auto White Balance is great and the controls are intuitive to me.  The LCD is high resolution.  The wrist strap is a great way to carry the camera safely while keeping it ready to take pictures quickly.  The \"Set\" control can be a bit awkward but is not a major disadvantage.  No camera is perfect.  This camera gives you 5MP in a small and light package with very sharp images right out of the camera.  It's also a lot of fun.  I don't want to go back to film.

{"Title":"Too big to be useful as a point and shoot","Author":"T. Tom","ReviewID":"R1L33I3DC7X6G3","Overall":"good","Content":"Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one.My main complaint about this camera is that it is too bulky. In fact, it was so bulky and heavy that I ended up selling it to a friend and going with the Canon s400 instead.  For me, the real power in a point and shoot camera is size and convenience. The more convenient it is to lug, the more you will have it with you to capture life's precious moments.  And the s50 should most certainly be considered a point and shoot camera because it's manual controls are strange to operate and I eventually found myself not wanting to bother with them because of the way they are implemented on this camera.For instance,  being able to shoot at a wide aperture on the s50 is of limited usefulness because the zoom lens doesn't maintain the wide aperture when you zoom in even just a little. So during the times I used my s50 and wanted a shallow depth of field, ie. when i was doing portraits, the f-stop automatically changed itself from f2.8 to f4.0 or f5.0 when I zoomed in to frame the shot.  I thought to myself, I  might as well have been shooting with the smaller and more convenient s400! Also, you might be tempted to think that flash exposure compensation is a godsend, like I initially did. But in practice, dialing down the flash on this camera yields dingy looking images in lower light. I was dissappointed.  Also, the image quality was cetainly acceptable and I have no complaint there, however the image processing time and shutter lag was definitely noticeable, especially indoors in mid to low light levels. The s50 is just too big to carry around everywhere and subsequently, I did miss taking certain photos because the camera was back in the car or at home. I does not fit well in a shirt pants pocket and it weighs down a jacket pocket. When I wanted to slip it into my my film camera bag, it took up too much space and was unwieldy. My recommendation if you must have manual controls in a digital camera is to either step up to the Canon G3 or equivalent, or go to a digital SLR.  Otherwise, for a carry-around-everywhere camera, the smaller Canon ELPH series would be best.I never really used the tiny viewfinder and don't recommend that you do either. Why? It's very tiny and not convenient, and it only shows a portion of the image frame. Also, it does not show any information such as shutter speed or f-stop. You are much better of using the LCD screen and doing so will give you a \"what you see is what you get\" image on the camera.","Date":"April 19, 2003"}

I like the convenience of using a digital camera and the fun and instant gratification from viewing a slideshow on my Apple Powerbook immediate after returning from a trip!Things I liked:S50 looks cool and with the black metallic body is a piece of art. Its relatively small in size and the fit and finish is great. The camera has a LOT of features and very easy to use and learn.  The best part of the camera is that it takes GREAT macro pictures and human portraits in close-ups. It can be as good or even better than my lan 7 with 28-90 lenses in that area.Things I disliked:But the biggest problem is that it doesn't take great pictures! In auto mode the pictures are not very sharp and the color are not so vivid like Nikon's. The exposure compensation is terrible and rarely will it take a correct exposure in difficult lighting conditions. Pretty much I can't use the Auto mode/s to take good pictures. I have to adjust the exposure setting and the shutter speed to get good pictures.  So this camera is really the digital equivalent of a point-and-shoot zoom camera like my Canon Sure Shot 115 but costing thrice as much!!!Other minor shortcomings are:The LCD screen can't be covered, the battery doesn't last for more than 100 shots and there is no handgrip to hold the camera. So you need a mini tripod as well!Further you can't add an external flash (the built is too bright for close-ups and too faint for big areas) or external lenses and macros or telephotos.Recommendation:I will strongly recommend you get the Canon G3 for much better performance for about the same price. Trust me, unless u want to blow up or print in 8\"10\" you won't see any diff from 4 MP and 5 MPI don't knwo why ppl are giving great reviews about S50.

{"Title":"Excellent picture quality, but Minolta F300 is better","Author":"Chris Lee","ReviewID":"R26JHTSUNBQFE3","Overall":"good","Content":"The S50 is a very solid camera, and its exterior styling shows.  This is not a camera you see Asian girls in shiny tight mini's and high heel flip flops would carry on their wrists.  It looks almost utilitarian, a no-nonsense type of imaging product.  The best thing about the S50 is its picture quality.  Unfortunately the flash is on the weak side, and the picture color spectrum is \"flat\" as is usual with Canon's cameras.  I think the Minolta Dimage F300, also made in Japan, is a better choice: excellent picture quality (particulary for printouts), cheaper price, 2 AA batteries, stronger flash, and better styling - especially if you are an Asian girl in high heels.","Date":"September 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"Buyers Beware! Defects and void warranty","Author":"Jonathan","ReviewID":"R2NBC6KUYMCVGP","Overall":"bad","Content":"This review refers to Canon digital cameras at large. My experience is with the G5 not the S50. Both are more or less the same camera only the G5 has better zoom and flash shoe.I got my G5 in August through Amazon. In December the LCD has stopped working, and a few days later the Camera completely stopped functioning.At the time I was travelling with my wife to Europe and Canon refused to service the Camera. Apparently you can only get US local service to it (they even don't allow shipping back to the States) and get this - I took this to Amazon customer service which warned me that by taking this Camera outside the United States, \"you void the manufacturer's warranty on this item. This could make any future servicing of the item difficult and costly.\"Since we are due to get back to the States only in 3 months, and I need a WORKING camera to shoot while on vacation, not when I am home, I had to pay today $350 to fix it and replace the \"Optical Unit\".I will never buy a Canon product again.Sony gives you worldwide walk-in warranty, no matter where you are you in the world you go or call a local Sony service center and get your Camera fixed.Now, that Sony offers CF and not just MemoryStick and with the excellent reviews it gets from the user community, there is really no reason to take the risk with Canon. Their Cameras ship with defects and the service is the worst I came across so far.","Date":"January 14, 2004"}

Now, if only I were able to make out the subject of my photographs it might be something.  All I get is blurred, messed up images.  This is pretty consistent in any of its autofocus modes.  Sure!

I sat here for one hour trying to take a sharp picture of the stuff on my night stand, and was able to do it only on the manual focus mode.  Even then, the picture was not that sharp.

I could sit here and echo the same complaint that others had but its just not worth the time. Basically, i had the same complaints that Kaushik_ghosh, Jorge L. Troncoso, and Jo Andrew Senske had. I had the Sony DSC-85 at one point which was a 4 MP camera and yet it consistently gave me A LOT BETTER QUALITY pictures than this camera could ever muster. I think they discontinued the DSC-85. Anyway, i decided to write this review because i am now looking for another camera and am hoping to find good advice in Amazon as this camera just sucks.

{"Title":"The ultimate ELPH. Next generation maturity.","Author":"Jim Krupnik \"jkrupnik\"","ReviewID":"R14JUIICQVQBBQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the S-400 to upgrade from the S-200 that I have been using since it was made available. I love the S-200, as it is both durable and handy. It has also become a great value with recent price reductions. On the other hand, I wanted to get the most recent tech advances in the smallest package, so the S-400 was the clear choice.Here are my initial impressions, and some of the improvements / differences between the 200 and the 400. First of all, Canon has paid close attention to the nits and picks of users of the earlier cameras in the ELPH line. Aside from the addition of cutting edge developments, there have been subtle changes that greatly increase it's ease of use. This is an incredible camera built into a compressed case. Except for being ever so slightly thicker than the S-200, it is the same  cigarette pack size.It has a 4 mega pixel sensor, and it is quick and accurate. Color saturation and contrast are outstanding. The lens is very sharp from edge to edge (I tested at various light levels from macro mode (1.5\") to infinity focus, and it consistantly produced remarkably fine images). 8x10 prints are outstanding. Period. At long shutter speeds (up to 15 sec), the sensor is remarkably free from \"noise\". In fact, it does better than many SLR style digicams in all areas of picture quality.The 3x optical zoom is a welcome addition. Now you can take a proper head an shoulders portrait without invoking the relatively lossy digital zoom, or suffering from the effects of distorted facial features caused by getting too close with a too short lens. When you need it though, the digital zoom offers up to 11x total zoom power, and returns pretty good results as digital zooms go. The 400 retains the special effects lineup of the 200, and they work very well. The tonal range of the black & white option is a real treat. The final result isn't exactly Panatomic X quality, but it is really good, and your darkroom for artistic dodging and burning is contained entirely on your hard drive.The case is still steel, but has a ceramic coating that is supposed to be even more scratch resistant. It is also much \"whiter\", and offers MUCH better contrast when you read the various control labels. While the contols are similar, they are also marked with larger and bolder lettering. All in all, a big improvrment. The michrophone was moved from the front to the top of the case. I think the front makes more sense, but it works very well on top. Canon also included a tiny (but effective) speaker in the 400. You can now select or create sounds for all camera functions (even a \"real\" shutter sound), as well as make voice notes for each photo taken if desired. Most sound functions are individualy adjustable for volume, and several sound \"themes\" are included. Techno-tinkerers might enjoy customizing the photo displayed upon startup. Movie preview also has sound now.On the subject of movies, the 400 makes a little tradeoff. The max resolution is no longer 640x480, it is 320x240 (which is fast becoming standard for movies from still cameras). On the other hand, it is not limited to 10 seconds anymore. You can now make clips up to 3 minutes each. Computer playback looks very good. TV playback isn't bad at all. As a pocket sized way to film Junior taking his first bike ride without training wheels, it can't be beat.The shutter button and zoom ring are a little larger, and now feel just right. The 400 has also incorporated the mode selector wheel used on other high end Canon cameras. This is long overdue, as it makes using all of the many features and modes a real joy.Red eye appears to be better than before, but I don't expect much from such a close coupled flash / lens combo, and who really cares, as it is corrected with a click of the mouse before you print a photo. A few MAJOR improvements are the 9 zone Ai AF, and new (yellow) focus assist. If you were not careful, the 200 could return slightly out of focus shots, and in low light, the focus assist sometimes didn't. That has been fixed. The 9 zone intelligent AF really does an amazing job, and the new focus assist achieves lock under a much wider range of difficulty than the old system.The built in flash has a generous range for a tiny camera, and the coverage is very even. Shooting a blank wall within the range of the flash shows no \"hot spots\". The metering options are still program, center weighted, or spot, but the program mode seems to have been given a big boost. The 200 does very well, but the 400 is on par with the SLR class for getting it right the first time.Exposure bracketing is +/- 2 EV, slow synchro flash is still there to boost background brightness when needed, the panoramic stitch mode is still a treat, and, in general, this is nothing less than a James Bond version of a full featured, top quality 4+ megapixel digital camera. The only tradeoff is that a full sized camera with similar features might offer a larger lens aperture. That can extend your non flash low light level by an F stop or so, but it does no good if the camera is sitting at home, rather than in your pocket. If it is in your budget, get this camera. Not only will you take more quality pictures over time, but you won't be burdened by feeling like a conspicuous tourist while doing it.One last note. Buy a high speed (24x) 256 meg memory card. The speed alows for quicker second shots (the 400 can do 2.5 FPS in continuous mode), and the 256 meg size gives you a full 128 shots at the highest resolution, many hundreds of pics at the low res setting.","Date":"March 25, 2003"}
{"Title":"Excellent camera, highly recommended over the Sony DSC-P10","Author":"BobbyDigital","ReviewID":"R3S43DZ9TI2ON2","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought the S400 from Dell for $xxx a little while back and was considering the Sony DSC-P10 at the time as well.  I figured I'd write up a review on amazon to help other people out that are in the decision making process.Price:-----The Sony DSC-P10 is 5 MP vs. 4 MP for the S400.  The difference in resolution may immediately sway your decision to teh DSC-P10, but I would think very carefully. While the extra 1 MP sounds like a lot, my old 2.0 MP Canon S00 was fine for priting pictures all the way up to 8x10 (w/o any cropping). 4 MP resolution should allow you to price 11x14 with no cropping, and 8x10 with a lot of cropping.  5 MP is just excessive IMO. These days, it's just a race among manufacturers to see who can advertise the highest MP number.Shooting modes and menus---------------------------------P10 also has some convenient shooting modes which make it more user friendly.  It also has great features like cropping, resizing and rotating right on the camera which helps when you are not by a computer and want to free up room on your media storage.The Canon S400 has a far superior menu system and is much easier to use.Size:-----Canon S400 is smaller, making it a more pocketable camera IMO. Trust me on this one.  The specs shown them being only very slightly different in dimensions, but the total volume of the cameras makes the S400 ideal.  Those with bigger hands may prefer the layout and slightly larger size of the P10 though.Memory storage:---------------The P10 uses Memory cards, which are limited to 128 MB, unless you use the double sided ones (Sony Memory Duo), where you can flip them over to get another 128 MB. Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it. My friend who bought the P10 surely does.  You can get larger memory sticks, which comes in the form of the \"Sony Memory Pro\", which are 256 MB and 512 MB.  Keep in mind though, that these cards have problems acting as regular storage for files, and things like Mp3s for sony mp3 players. They have some type of digital rights management (DRM) on them that have causes lots of problems for people (so i've read on many reviews).  Also, these PRO cards only work in 2003 (or newer) sony devices.  Lastly, the memory pro cards have some type of management files on the cards themselves, taking up about 20MB of space. So a 256 MB card, really only has about 230 MB.  Maybe not a big deal, but com'on, at advertise the size correctly!Battery Life:-------------Battery life on P10 is better than the S400. It will last about 20% longer.  However, the batteries are cheaper for the S400 AFAIK and they also charge in about 1/2 the time vs. the sony batteries.Conclusion:-----------All in all, i think the S400 is a better choice. Sure, CF maybe outdated in a few years in favor of smaller, superior storage media like SD, MMC or xD cards (which are going up to 1 GB btw), but until then you can get a great digicam with dirt cheap media. I picked up a 512 MB Kingston card for very cheap from eBay.Tips for those buying the S400:-------------------------------1. Ensure you buy good quality CF cards for the S400. CF cards have on-board processor on the cards themselves which actually regulate how fast the read+write is, unlike smartmedia which reliees on the camera.  This means that CF cards will differ greatly in speed for read+write performance.  Recommendations are Viking, RiData and Kingston. I have used about 7 or 8 different types of cards, and these are definitely the best in speed and reliability.  Viking can be found cheap on Amazon deals quite often (with rebates), and kingston and ridata can be found on eBay for cheap.2. Buy the legitimate Canon branded NB-1LH batteries. They can be had for about $30-$40 if you look hard enough. Stay away from NB-1L (notice the H is suffix is missing). The NB-1L is the lower capacity battery for these cameras.  Stay away from aftermarket batteries. Sure they sell for MUCH cheaper (often 1/3 the price), but reliability and longevity of these are just brutal. There are always exceptions to the rules -- some ppl have have great experiences, which others have dead batteries almost right away.  Why risk having a dead battery while you are on vacation and miss those Crucial shots of your wife/gf?  Spend the extra $15 and get the real-deal batteries.Recommended purchase:----------------------Canon S400-256 or 512 MB Viking, RiData or Kingston CF card-1 extra battery NB-1LH-Camera Case PSC-100 -- padded case with front storage for extra battery and storage. Very compact and nice looking.","Date":"December 30, 2003"}

The S230, S45, and the S400 up to Boston while I do a bit of sightseeing between interviews. The reasons why I brought 3 of my camera was to see which camera will have the higest quality of picture.I took photos of the Cambridge area, the Northern docks, and of Fenway with all three cameras... and of close up and group photos with my friends in the area. The fastest camera to start up was the S400. In fairly close up photos and group photos in daylight or good lighting situations, there wasn't a discernable amount of difference between the three cameras especially after printing out the photos on a photo-quality inkjet printer. I noted differences in distance shooting (landscaping photos) and low light situations. Landscape shots of the Boston Harbor captured better details especially with objects in the far background with the S400 and S45. Distant shots of Fenway captured sharper details on the S400 and S45 as well. Nighttime shots were best captured on the S45... although not by a great deal over the S230 and S400. The range of manual controls were without a doubt better on the S45 and that allowed me to take better twilight landscape photos than the other two digital cameras. The surprise was that the S400 seemed the fastest to display the picture in the LCD after the shutter button is pressed and the continuous shot modes were also considerable faster to me than the S230 and S45.","Date":"April 13, 2003"}
{"Title":"Fast 4 megapixel wonder!","Author":"Technology Nut \"Radical\"","ReviewID":"R1QWTGBTJJ4UY6","Overall":"good","Content":"After extensive research on the web ...I chose to upgrade my Canon S20 to a Canon S400.  In someways, this was a step down.  Unfortunately, the S400 does not support verticle alignment of it's panoramic \"stitch assist\" mode as they do on the S40, S45, S50 and other higher priced models.  I found this feature on the S20 to be very useful in capturing more image (greater resolution and consistant panning) when stitching photos together to make a panoramic photo.  Also, the S400 does not support the higher resolution movie mode of 640 x 320, as some digital cameras support.  Hopefully, Canon will address these feature shortfalls with a firmware upgrade in the near future.  As mentioned in a number of reviews, the S400's flash is miniscule and thus is somewhat inadequate to light wide distant shots.Canon has improved the intelligence of the powershot digital line.  Specifically in the S400 the Digic processing makes for fast picture taking and viewing.  The size of the S400 is grand.  It does fit in a pocket and powers up so quickly, you may never miss another shot with this camera (keeping in mind to charge your battery and have enough flash memory for the moment!!!).The bottom line... the Canon S400 is compact, sturdy, and fast.  If you are looking for a very small 4 megapixel camera with nice even colors, low levels of distortion, a basic movie capture mode, fast memory writing and reading, the S400 is a current top pick.  However, if you are looking for lots of manual control, vertical \"photo stitching,\" and more pixels try the S50.One note if considering the S45 or S50 cameras, play with the navigation buttons before purchasing the unit;  I have found the navigation to be somewhat clumsy in-which it is easy to hit \"enter\" when trying to navigate \"up\" or \"down,\" or hit \"up\" when trying to \"enter.\"","Date":"June 12, 2003"}

Both photographic quality and portability are of paramount concerns and I think I found my holy grail with Canon S400.Pros:- Extremely portable, yet very rugged- Beautiful design with excellent overall ergonomics- Typically excellent photo quality in all-auto mode with no redeye- Very fast -- startup time, image processing and acquisition, menu response- Long battery life- Uses widely popular (and inexpensive) CompactFlash Type 1 memory cards- 4 megapixel resolution (2272x1704)- 3X optical zoom/11X max with digital- Useful movie mode with audio (3 minutes at 320x240 or 160x120)Cons:- Minimal manual controls (e.g., no manual focus)- Cheap A/V/digital output cover- Movie mode limited to 3 minutes (and no 640x480 mode may irk some)- Proprietary battery- Some barrel distortion when taking wide angle shotsWhile S400 has some shortcomings, mainly lack of manual focus, exposure, and shutter speed. And some may be bothered by its use of proprietary lithium ion battery, although given its compact size, I think Canon engineers had to implement proprietary battery. On the plus side, the battery lasts a long time, capable of taking several hundred shots before running out of juice (and takes only a couple of hours to recharge).I've managed to fill entire 512MB memory card (32MB is included) on a single battery charge.Did I mention how beautiful this camera is? The photos do not do this camera a justice. At 3.4\" by 2.2\" by 1.1\", the S400 is no larger than most compact cell phones. Inch by inch, it's only a tad larger than my tiny Sony Ericsson T68i cell phone and smaller than (although a bit thicker) my Apple iPod MP3 player.The ergonomics are consistently excellent. Although there are some learning curves (particularly given rich feature set), once mastered (comprehensive manuals make it easy), most will appreciate elegant menu layout and ideal number of buttons and layout.But beautiful design means nothing if it does not accomplish its main functions -- taking beautiful pictures. In full auto setting, which is what majority people might use, the pictures were consistently satisfying, although overriding the white balance to match the lighting condition improved the quality significantly in many shots.This is a great camera.","Date":"April 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"Great camera in a tiny size-even better than higher model","Author":"T. Tom","ReviewID":"RRYD62GLM0Q1U","Overall":"good","Content":"I like this little digital camera. It does everything a point and shoot digital camera should do and more. For me, a point and shoot camera should be small and light so that it can conveniently go with me everywhere. That's the power of any point and shoot camera actually. It goes with you in your daily life and subsequently you get shots that you could not get with other larger cameras either because it would be too conspicous, or too inconvient to carry with you.The S400 camera is barely larger or heavier than a pak of cigarettes and even fits in a shirt pocket with relative ease.I originally had an S50 but ended up getting rid of it because it was too big and heavy and the manual controls on it were cumbersome to use. In the end, the manual controls on the S50 were not worth having to carry around such a brick-like camera.  The S50 often ended up staying at home or in the car and I missed out on shots because I did not have the camera with me.The images out of the S400 suprisingly enough, look even better to me than those out of the S50. I can't really explain why this is considering that the S50 is a full 1 megapixel higher than the S400.I don't miss having the full manual controls that the S50 has at all. When I had the S50, I found that I hardly ever used the manual controls anyway because they are a bit cumbersome. I actually longed for more ease and simpleness, which frees one up to take pictures more spontaneously.  So the small size and convenience of the S400 more than outweighs the lack of full manual controls for me.  And the S400 does have manual mode where you can dial in some settings manually, just not f-stop and shutter speed. Further, you can often achieve the same effects as if you had full manual controls just by knowing how to set the S400. For example, if I want to shoot an outdoor portrait with a shallow depth of field (so the background will be blurry), I would set the camera's ISO to 50 and then meter off of something fairly dark (like the shade) while holding down the shutter down halfway to lock the exposure and recompose to the subject to take the picture.To conclude, I am happy with this camera because it does everything a small point and shoot digital camera should do, yet it is quite small, light, feels sturdy (metal case) and has very pleasant ergonomics both with regard to the layout of the controls as well as to the on screen menu functions.","Date":"June 9, 2003"}
{"Title":"Buyer Beware! Temperature Changes May Kill This Camera!","Author":"\"tilbertwag\"","ReviewID":"R2UMKPDRQ85XNJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought an S400 seven months ago and was very happy with it. Recently, however, it stopped working without warning. When I sent it in to the factory service center, I discovered something very troubling about the camera that had I known earlier would have caused me to not purchase it.It turns out that this model--as well as many other Canon digital cameras, the tech told me--has an aluminum body. If you subject the camera to temperature changes (and it only takes a change of 10-15 degrees, I was told) condensation will form inside the camera, and the camera will start to corrode, eventually rendering it unusable.This is what had happened to me. What misuse had I subjected my camera to that caused this to happen? I took it on vacation to the beach with me. Carrying it from the hot and humid beach into an air conditioned car was enough to destroy the camera!The tech told me that he sees this all the time. He didn't know the percent of all Canon cameras that suffer this fate, but he said a lot of them do. He told me he gets lots of cameras back from people who have taken them on vacation to Arizona, Mexico, and Hawaii. He even saw one that had stopped working because the owner kept it stored in a stuffy closet. When the owner eventually took it out to use it, the temperature change back to normal room temperature was enough to fry the camera.I was told that this damage is not covered under warranty and that the manual cautions users not to subject their cameras to this sort of treatment. Canon will not provide service on cameras that suffer this fate.I hope anyone interested in purchasing a Canon digital camera will learn from my very expensive mistake in purchasing this model.The camera is very nicely designed, but it's poorly engineered. If you plan to use the camera indoors only this is a great model. But if you plan to use the camera both outdoors and indoors, if there is a difference in humidity and temperature between the two where you live, and if you don't want to run the risk of totally losing your investment in the camera, this isn't the model or brand for you.","Date":"May 7, 2004"}
{"Title":"Wonderful little camera","Author":"V. Block","ReviewID":"RZTIS200P01TA","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my 3rd digital camera, having owned two bulkier Olympus models previously. I was looking for a smaller camera that would be easier to carry. After much research I chose this Canon S400, and it's just about perfect. The display is clear and easy to use. The included rechargeable battery and charger are easy to use, very small, and the battery charges fairly quickly after the initial charge. I took it with on a trip to DisneyWorld, where I took about 50 pictures daily. It fit nicely into a small pocket of my waistbag. I purchased with it two 256MB Sandisk CF cards, they have worked flawlessly thus far. Hooking the camera up to my iMac was no problem, I hooked up the included USB cable and iPhoto instantly recognized the camera; the pictures were uploaded in no time. The only thing I'd really like is a decent case to protect it in my bag. The Canon case that can be purchased separately is rather chintzy. I currently keep it in a neoprene eyeglass zip case that I picked up at a sporting goods store.","Date":"October 24, 2003"}
{"Title":"Canon WOW's again!","Author":"Tom the Bike Guy","ReviewID":"R2JZ8083BNHPET","Overall":"good","Content":"Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it does!. I bought the Canon S230 (3.2mp) in January and have already upgraded to the S400. This camera has been in stock for several weeks at online stores I probably can't mention here. I've had mine for a week now. Overall this is a great camera, it's the same size as the S230, very carryable, high quality, improved optics and zoom (3x optical instead of 2x) and the extra megapixels come in handy. There are a few minor points to pick at.1). Certain parts of the camera are now plastic instead of metal as on the S230 (from what I can tell, the zoom ring around the power button, the chrome ring around the lens, and the edges of the lens). The main body of the camera is still metal, however it's a new finish (Cerabrite) which has an odd plasticky look to it. Overall the construction quality doesn't feel quite as nice as the S230, notably the feel of the buttons when pressed, however it's nothing to be alarmed about.2). For some reason Canon removed the 640x480 movie mode option. I never used the movie mode extensively, but this might matter to some users.3). While some people might like it, (I think it's tacky) Canon has added the following useless features: Camera startup sound, shutter sound, camera display theme and startup image. There are cheesy sounds like a bird chirp, or a wolf howl, startup images like a Canon logo, picture of sunset, bird, etc. Due to the addition of these features the camera now has a tiny speaker. One benefit of the speaker/sounds is that Canon has added a self-timer sound which I think is useful.Some other nice additions/changes include the ability to edit the length of movie clips on the camera, a closer focusing distance in the macro setting, and the ablility to record a sound bye of up to 60 seconds to a picture (also useable as a simple voice recorder for recording memos, thoughts, etc) which will play back via the tiny speaker. The microphone has been moved from the front of the camera to the top, this could be good or bad depending, it may record less wind noise in windy situations (especially if facing into the wind), however it may also no longer pick up quieter sounds due to the repositioning.At a minimum I would reccommend the use of a 128mb card, preferrably 256mb or larger. At less than $$$ I would suggest an external memory card reader to be used for transfering photos instead of the Canon software which seems buggy at times. As far an extra battery goes, some people won't live without an extra. With the price of the battery, I'd pass. Canon says the camera is good for 190 photos with the LCD on (400+ with LCD off). I've never taken more than 50 pictures in a day and have always had an opportunity to recharge the battery during some down time in the evening.To sum things up, if you're looking for a high quality high megapixel camera that's easily carryable, and hardly noticed in most pockets, this is it!. The combination of size, quality and features of this camera are unmatched!. If you don't require 4 megapixels or want to save $$$ I'd highly reccommend the S230 which I have also reviewed.","Date":"March 26, 2003"}

I didn't care too much for the software it came with but then again, others might see it pretty useful.  I've used other cameras such as the S100/S110, S200, S400, Sony dsc-p1, Sony cybershot dsc-f717, olympus c-5050.  Of all these, the S400 seems the most versatile with size, quality and capturing shots.Pros-Size being compact is a big plus!  Who wants to yank out a huge camera for a quick snapshot?  If you look at this camera closely, the battery + compact flash memory takes up about 30% of the camera space.  You'll be wondering how the heck they fit  all that in there?-Quick shots with quick focus.  Of all the cameras I've used, this has got to be the best camera to 'capture' with.  The reason I'm saying this is because I've missed so many opportunities of capturing a shot due to a delay. (long focus/range)-Ease of use.  Once you spend a good 30-60 min reviewing the manual and functionalities, you will be zoomin on the interface.  For example, changing the type of photo (sephia/b&w;) setting took 4-5 presses of a button.  The Olympus C-5050 took over 9 presses of a difficult interface just to change the photo settings-Nice indoor/outdoor shots.  I normally do not have trouble taking pictures outdoors. The problem usually relates to indoor shots.  The flash on this baby is pretty powerful!-Price - Like I said, you can spend double the money and you will probably get more manual features to play around with. Aperture, shutter, +/- fine tuning.  Why spend the extra money on features you probably won't even use? (...)Con-Zoom  Every digital camera out there that has zoom capabilities, does not impress me.  Of course coming from the s400, you'll be wondering how they fit all that in such a compact size!  In any case, the zoom has improved since the s100/s110 days so this should be more of a 'pro' than a conIf you want a digital camera that is still considered to be high rez for most consumers (4 megapixel is more than enough), a camera that is easy to use, affordable, acts quickly (takes quick shots), compact and reliable.

CF card that is included if you want to hold more than 20-40 images before up-loading.As for image quality in the auto mode, the red eye reduction does not work most of the time. The flash although very bright in the foreground does not seem to illuminate the background and leaves it pixilated (a common problem with small flashes in digital cameras when photographing indoors). The contrast, brightness, and colors seem to be true.I purchased this camera as a quick point and shoot compact and an alternative to dragging around my 8 pound Nikon D1.If you are looking for a small compact and you do not need National Geographic quality images, this camera would be a good choice.","Date":"November 19, 2003"}

{"Title":"Comparison of S400 and Pentax Optio S","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1M4OXOYBYQPHI","Overall":"good","Content":"I was on the market for a new camera--to upgrade from a 2 MP Olympus we bought a year ago.  I wanted the camera to be small, so I narrowed the choice down to the Canon S400 and the Pentax Optio S.  I ordered both (from companies that offered no-penalty returns) and reviewed them for several days.  After side-by-side testing, I'm going with the S400.  Here's why:1) Controls: the controls on the Canon are better and require less digging into internal menus to do what you want to do.  Very important to me.  The Pentax has some but not as many external options--you have to dig more.  Some examples: Movie mode, panoramic mode.  Also, the little Pentax 4-way-plus-\"okay\" (center push) joystick is pretty small, and although the average user can learn to use it quickly, it is still not desirable.2) Screen quality: Much better on the Canon--brighter, sharper, etc.  Pentax screen is a bit darker and slightly pixely.3) Focus/shooting: With the Pentax, when you press the button to focus, it freezes the frame for a second, where as the Canon doesn't freeze the frame--it allows you to see your subject at all times.  This was slightly annoying at first but became unbearable when I attempted to snap pics of my 1-year old daughter who was crawling!  Also, the Pentax takes longer to focus for most shots.4) Movie mode: Canon's higher quality mode was much better--a sharper, cleaner, brighter movie.  Sound quality is a little better, but not lots.5) Battery door: The Pentax's door is super cheesy, just like all the reviews say, although this is not a major concern for me.6) Overall construction: I think this Canon will take a bit of a beating--the Pentax feels a bit [weak] in comparison.7) Battery charger: This is a small item, but I like the fact that the Canon charger is a little unit with a plug on it--so you don't need any extra cords to plug it in--it just plugs straight into the wall.8) Picture quality: Canon's 9-point focusing system works really well.  The pictures are clean and crisp.  The Pentax takes a bit long to focus at times, and I got a few blurry pics--sometimes it focuses on the wrong thing.  I didn't notice a major difference with the quality between the 3.2 MP and 4.0 MP, but I'm sure if I blew up an 8x12 bigger I'd notice the difference.9) Panorama: I think Canon does the Panorama thing slightly better, although the Pentax does it well, too.Here's what's better about the Pentax:1) Size--super small and light.  Absolutely amazing.  Although, to be fair to Canon, the S400 is virtually the same size as the S200, which is impressive.2) Great battery life.  Can't say it is much better than Canon's, but it is good.3) Super short lag time between photos in review mode (and slightly longer but still short in photo mode)--slightly shorter than Canon's, but I can handle that.4) Colors seem more natural.  In the automatic mode with the Canon, the colors are a bit too bright, almost unreal, BUT you can use the manual mode with the Canon and choose a \"neutral\" setting to deal with the color issue.5) The Pentax has slightly more manual control, like manual focus, for instance.In summary: If you want super small, go with the Pentax.  If you want solid and super high, durable quality, go with the Canon.  The Canon runs about $$$ more (you can find it for less, though), but I think it is worth it.  Read the other reviews on Amazon (and elsewhere) as well, but I haven't heard any major complaints about the S400.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.","Date":"May 26, 2003"}
{"Title":"Tiny Enough To Take With You","Author":"SML","ReviewID":"R2HYJHMYU9NXKH","Overall":"good","Content":"The Canon Powershot S400 is my second digital camera. The first was a 1.2 MP Olympus that was just way too big to carry around. I chose the Canon based on three factors: Size, Image Quality, and Ease of Use.Size-- Size was my biggest concern. It's so tiny!! :) The camera is about the same size as a deck of playing cards. Nevertheless, the LCD screen is of a usable size and the buttons aren't so tiny that you need to use a fingernail to depress them. The viewfinder is a bit small, but atypically, shows a fairly true representation of what your shot will look like. I found the LCD screen to be a much better way of taking pictures.Image Quality-- Wow! I was so pleased! None of my images have needed major color correction. The white balance is right on track. This little camera gets it right even in difficult color situations like bright sunlight. Flesh tones come out nice and natural and whatever Canon has done to eliminate red eye really works. I'd highly recommend this camera to people picky about image quality.  The camera allows you to set the resolution of your photo. I've taken most of mine on \"fine\", but there's also a \"superfine\" resolution. I find that on the superfine, I get 14 shots. I average about 27 on fine. This brings me to my only issue with this camera-- What's up with the 32 MB card?? If you're spending this amount of money on a camera, it ought to come with a bigger card. I went out and bought a 256 MB one almost instantly.Ease of Use-- Ease of use is the category that kept me from giving this camera five stars. It's very easy to learn the basic functions. Taking pictures, zooming in, zooming out, etc. The menus for the more complex functions are a bit less intuitive. They present you with useless options like changing the LCD's splash screen first and make you dig for important things like changing the resolution of the images. If you read the book, you'll get everything after a few rounds of shots, but you do need to read the book.Overall, I am VERY pleased with my camera and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.","Date":"May 27, 2003"}

GENTLY pry the front of the camera off (I used a tiny flathead screwdriver, inserting it into the crack and gently turning it), and then lift the lower right corner of the copper flap (it might be held down by a touch of adhesive).  Gently pop out the little battery.  Reverse to assemble.

{"Title":"Old model, but still excellent","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"R3R0S02QN0BJWR","Overall":"good","Content":"Before you buy the S400, you should know it's already over one and a half years old, so it's in the process of being discontinued -- hence the low price on Amazon and elsewhere, even though this list price is still high.  That said, this is still probably the best consumer-grade digital camera on the market today.  Let me expound.First, 4-MP is the perfect resolution for day-to-day photography.  That is, if you are a pro photographer and need the best resolution, you probably want 5+ megapixels.  But for us normal mortals, 4MP is already more than enough.  You can crop your pictures and still make great 8\"x10\" blow-up prints.  A year ago I would have recommended a 3-MP camera, but right now you can get this 4-MP camera for cheaper than a 3-MP a year ago, so go for this one.Is more pixels always better?  Not necessarily.  More pixels mean bigger files as well as slower save speed, so it's best to strike a balance between resolution and speed, and 4 MP should be good enough.Second, the picture quality on this Canon is just excellent.  Earlier models of Canon (esp. the Digital Elph line) tended to underexpose and yield cold color tones, but the S400 does a very good job of keeping a natural, slightly warmer color range.  The pictures are still a little bit softer than sharp images captured by Nikon SLR's, but overall you'll be pleased by the picture quality, both indoors and outdoors.  The flash range could be longer, but the same can be said of all built-in flash units.The camera is easy to set up and use, and transfering pictures to Windows XP is a piece of cake.  The build quality is top-notch.  I highly recommend this camera.","Date":"March 13, 2004"}

She was one of those \"I like film\" girls...two weeks later it's like, \"What's film?\" She's loves it. I love it. In fact, I love it so much I'm thinking about buying a second one for myself. So obviously I'm recommending this camera. But I have a few suggestions for you folks who are about to hit that Buy Now button. First, this $400 to $500 camera doesn't come with a carrying case of any kind. You can get a great one right here on Amazon for $12 -- the Canon PSC-50 Soft Leather Case for Digital Cameras. Add to Cart. Second, this camera comes with a 32MB CF memory card. We've discovered this is fine for pics, but when you start taking movies (and you will, this is a great feature!) this size memory card fills up in a flash. If I was buying this camera today, I would also buy an extra CF card with at least 256MB of memory. This great camera is limited without it. Finally, while this camera takes amazing pics, it also produces amazing red-eye. Make sure your photo program has a red-eye reduction feature (and most do). Or load on the software that comes with the camera because you're gonna need to do some red-eye zapping.So take into account these few learned nuggets of wisdom and take the leap into the digital age with a Canon S400!

{"Title":"Marvelous!!!!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1X7TEVH1C4BJZ","Overall":"good","Content":"One of the most important reason why I purchased the S400 is because of its size.I've own other digital cameras before and have also traveled with them. After awhile, I would not want to carry the digital cameras because they were bulky and inconvenient. I found myself wasted a lot of money on cameras that I rarely use.The S400 solved that problem right away. I just put this tiny camera in my pants and off I go. My hands are not weighted down by any unnecessary bulk.Moreover, the picture quality is very good. The controls are also very intuitive. It has just enough manual modes that would make me happy. I'm pleasantly surprise how powerful the flash is compared to my other digital cameras. So powerful that I had to adjust the exposure level... I also love the long battery life.The only complaints I have are:1. Auto White Balance doesn't work well under certain conditions. For example in-door with light bulb lighting, the picture is very yellow. I hope Canon would fix this problem with a firmware udpate.2. Unable to delete selected pictures from the Camera.

I had previous owned a Minolta S404, and I have been much happier with the Powershot for the following reasons:1. The autofocus mechanism is much more reliable than the Minolta S404 in my experience. This probably has something to do with the autofocus assist lamp. Even in bright outdoor scenes, the Powershot seems to do a better job.2. Less noise in low light situation than the Minolta S404. None of the flash photos that I've taken with this camera have shown signficant color noise problems like what I saw in the Minolta.3. Very short time between frames. When you turn off the LCD preview, you can shoot images back to back in under 2 seconds. The Minolta would pause nearly 4-5 seconds in most cases.4. It is actually compact enough to be easily portable. Don't fool yourself into thinking that one of the medium sized cameras (Minolta S404, Canon G3/G4/G5) will give you all the control you loved about your old 35mm SLR camera. They don't come close. To make matters worse, they are also no more portable than a full-size SLR. So in one sense, they are the worst of both worlds: too bulky to fit in a pocket, but not geeky enough to make real photo geeks happy. The Powershot is a good compromise in that you give up some manual features and interchangeable lenses, but you have a camera that will literally fit in your pocket.","Date":"June 5, 2003"}
{"Title":"A throw-away after the warranty expires","Author":"Nicole Larkin","ReviewID":"R2RUIY9JUT0LQ0","Overall":"bad","Content":"I spent dozens of hours researching before buying the S400.  I wanted something small and reasonably priced, 4 megapixels, and with excellent image quality.  I got those in my S400 -- for 14 months.The warranty expires after one year, but at the 14 month mark my camera began showing the message \"Memory Card Error,\" no matter what card I put in it.  I couldn't take pictures, nor could I use the camera to upload the pics already on the card onto my computer.  Luckily I had another card reading device and was able to transfer the pictures I had taken before my \"Memory Card Error\" woes began.I contacted Canon, and they said I can either pay $150 to $300 to repair it, or upgrade to a S410 for $260.  I might consider that, but guess what?  I already got screwed on my digital videocam that way.  My Canon video camera worked for two years then started eating tapes.  There were dozens of online histories about the problem and the fact that Canon wouldn't do anything about it, and my case was no different.  Seeing as I'd paid $1200 for the camera, I decided to have it fixed.  $250 later, the videocamera is back but it's already having more techincal problems.  Thus, my lesson is learned -- don't go the repair route.  Not only that, but we have a Canon printer, which actually works, but they stopped producing drivers about 2 years after we bought it.  The only way to print was to run Win95 on our computer.  So I guess Canon may make the best products on the market -- and they consistently get top reviews -- but their products aren't meant to last any longer than the warranty period.One thing I would also like to add: if you decide to risk it and buy the S400, be aware that indoor pictures usually end up with a strong color cast.  This is fixable with Photoshop, but not very easy to compensate for with cheaper photo manipulation programs.  And of course there is lots of red eye (I suggest a free program called Shutterfly Express that does an excellent job removing red eye), but you're going to get that with any ultra compact camera.When all is said and done, I used to be a satisfied customer, but now I'm done with Canon.

Here are things that I didn't know before my purchase.  Hope this helps.Type I CF card:The box came with SanDisk 32MB card, not with SimpleTech that Canon sells on their web site.  As compatibility seems to affect speed of write/read to/from the card, I was a bit concerned about buying SimpleTech.  My 512MB SimpleTech card has so far no discernable difference in performance.  (Sadly, I was actually expecting an improvement from SanDisk CF card based on review at [...]) Amazon's product description doesn't say SimpleTech CF card is Type I or II.  It's Type I that fits with S400.CF card capacity:My S400 says 512MB card can hold 247 pictures at highest resolution and Superfine setting.  (Someone wrote life was too short to bother with settings for lower quality images.  I agree.)  Its manual says 256MB should hold 123 images, as you can imagine.  256MB may be good enough, depending on your usage pattern.CF card reader:I also purchased a CF (only) card reader from SimpleTech (UCF-100).  Windows 2000 says CF card has FAT format as storage media.  There shouldn't be compatibility issues with your PC, in theory.  The software that comes with S400 recognizes CF card reader as a camera.  CF card reader's package says it can transfer data up to 1.5MB per second.  This can roughly mean, for S400, a picture a second.  Actual speed feels slightly slower than that.  (I used my clock to measure time.  Can't be too accurate.)  However, it seems to be three to four times faster than transferring image data from S400 directly.  When you have a lot of pictures on S400 to transfer, this speed advantage can justify having a CF card reader.Leather case PSC-50:I feel S400 needs a case as a protection though I didn't feel a need for my 35 mm point and shoot cameras from Canon and Olympus in the past.  This may be from its relative weight.  Because S400 doesn't come with a case of any sort, unless you know an alternative, buying this one can be a way to have one less thing to worry about in your life.Enjoy!!","Date":"December 6, 2003"}

I wanted a camera that produces high quality images, is very compact and easy to use.I have a Sony digital camcorder. Naturally, I was initially inclined to buy a Sony. Besides, Sony cameras (of the same price range) seem to have more features and more pixels than Canon cameras. But when I went to a store to check the cameras out, the Sony cameras reminded me of the (fairly new) Sony digital camcorder I have: the menu is so clumsy and illogical that sometimes it drives me nuts!In contrast, the Canon cameras struck me as extremely user friendly. Aside from the S400's size, metal body and its pleasing exterior, I couldn't believe how easy it was to navigate the controls. Everything is logically and intuitively laid out. For every menu choice one makes, the LCD screen displays the name of that function in addition to the icon. (One does not need to memorize what icon means what--one can read it on the LCD screen.)I chose the S400 above the other Canons, because I decided that the S400 offers just enough manual controls as a point-n-shoot camera. I figured that if I wanted full control, I'd buy a Sony DSC717; if I needed a camera for extreme high image quality, I'd use my Nikon SLR's. For most everyday use, including printing up to 8x11, 4mega pixels is more than sufficient.There are several things that I am disappointed with (aside from the 32mb memory and lack of a pouch):1. Flash pictures tend to be over exposed. Or else the picture is very dark. One can use the manual control to adjust the exposure compensation, but for spontaneous shots, that seems rather cumbersome.2. The red-eye reduction function doesn't seem to work very well on my set.3. When I installed the software on my  computer (Windows Me), the computer freezes at the end of the installation process. The software seems to work fine, but the freeze bugs me. I tried re-install a couple of times but the same thing happened.I believe that if you have Windows XP, you can simply plug the camera in and the computer will just recognize it as a removable harddisk. I have NOT tried this out yet though.An alternative to installing software is the USB cf card reader (I bought one made by SimpleTech for $16) which plugs in to my Windows Me computer and is immediately recognized as an additional device. The downside to that is that one has to remove the cf card from the camera and insert it into the reader. I am always afraid I'd bend one of those little pins through which the cf card connects to the various devices.Overall, I highly recommend this camera.","Date":"November 12, 2003"}
{"Title":"Middle of the road and repair advice","Author":"Mark D. Malham \"mboxm2415\"","ReviewID":"R3OBQYV9V2WKU9","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera mainly as a snapshot camera. I especially liked the size of the camera. Eventually I started using some of the more advanced features and found it to be fairly easy to use. Unfortunately I never really found the pictures to be all that great. Coming from a Kodak I was surprised at how the Canon failed to deliver better pics than it did. Nonetheless it was a good camera for what I needed.Then, like it seems everyone else has, I encountered the E50 memory card error. After looking online at potential fixes and seeing what Canon suggested and their cost, I found myself looking at new camera's last weekend. Something I really wasn't planning on being in the market for just now.Fortunately I happened across a solution yesterday that did eliminate the memory card error, at least for now. Last night I took 300 pictures and downloaded them onto my PC and no problems.The fix: I turned the camera on and put it in playback/review mode. I held the menu button down until I got a screen that asked if I wanted to restore the camera to factory settings and said Yes. I tried it in picture taking mode instead of review mode and it did not work, but when I did it in review it changed the settings back to factory and like I said, worked like a champ last night. I'll keep pushing it for a while and see if my error returns and report back.UPDATE:Two weeks and at least 1000 pictures later the camera is still working fine. I have four CF cards and after the fix all but one worked. The other I just did the same fix as before and it works as well. .","Date":"February 14, 2006"}
{"Title":"Fantastic!","Author":"Greg Markov","ReviewID":"R2X7BXEZPIXOHN","Overall":"good","Content":"I will purposefuly keep this review nice and short.  I own this camera, and after 1000's of shots I can only say this - it is simpy FANTASTIC!  Yes, FANTASTIC!  I have NEVER had a problem with this camera!  The pictures I take are amazing (not due to my own merits), and when I went to print them (at a local store), I was BLOWN away!  I have NEVER seen such good quality photos from ANY 35mm camera before.  The menus are easy to use and understand, and even the movie feature is neat (which I so didn't care about, I didn't know it had it when I bought it).  This camera has been perfectly compatible with BOTH my Mac OS X (direct plug into iPhoto) and my PC.  Also, the battery life is SUPER.  I was in Europe for several weeks, and never got the low battery light.  I got nervous towards the end, and bought a converter, so I could charge, but may have made it without it.  Of course, the charger is European current (220v) compatible, so all you need is a converter for the plug.  PLUS, I have dropped the camera several times, once in a Russian sub in Seattle, and it went far ... and it seemed to have taken it like a man.  So, it's pretty durable to boot!The only complain, is that it doesn't zoom enough.  But, I have learned to work around it.Be sure to buy an extra storage card (256 MEG +), because you will want to take the highest quality photos you can.  If you need smaller ones, doctor them up later, but take at highest quality and size first.  Don't worry the camera is just as fast to take large photos, as it is small ones.  The small photos look great, but the highest quality ones are AMAZING!I can't think of a camera being any better, other than one that is smaller ... but I am being too ungrateful now, so I will stop.  I stick this camera in my pants pocket, and it never bothers me (much).  =)","Date":"September 23, 2003"}
{"Title":"not for outside use","Author":"Douglas S. Gulick \"dgulick\"","ReviewID":"R23SXNH3HOWHEE","Overall":"bad","Content":"I owned this camera for 4 months and my only complaint was that there is a slight delay between pushing the button and the camera taking the picture, this makes it difficult to catch kids in action. However, my opinion changed drastically when it stopped working completely. We took it camping and left it in a car overnight to protect it from the elements, it was very cool, but in the morning it wouldn't power on. We sent it in for repairs under warranty and it was deemed 'beyond economic repair', meaning the cost of repairs were more than the cost of the camera. I thought this would result in a new camera, but no, it meant you're screwed! I talked to repair department supervisors, bumping it up until I was talking to the repair service head honcho who simply said \"sorry\". Apparently the manual warns you of this and tells you to put it in a plastic bag, yada yada yada. This was our first digital camera and we justified the cost because we would save so much on film development. Well if you have to pay $400 for a camera that only works for 4 months before you have to buy another one, I don't think it works out. By the way, I have a Canon EOS Elan SLR film camera that I've had for 8 years. I've taken it backpacking and have literally had it in waterfalls taking nature pictures, it's blown over on a tripod onto rock, it's bombproof, I swore by Canon, until now. Maybe this is a film vs. digital thing that is the same with all digital cameras, I don't know. Anyway, hope you benefit from this review.","Date":"June 16, 2004"}
{"Title":"Good, but not great","Author":"Greg Hansen","ReviewID":"RL4YOLH0XTVCQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for about 9 months and have taken about 1000 pictures.  It is my second digital camera (my previous being a Nikon Coolpix 950, which I used for about 3 years).Strengths:  Size (obviously), battery life (I've never run out of juice in a single day), speed to turn on (about 3 seconds), ease of reviewing pics, minimovies (more fun than I'd anticipated), image quality (if lighting is adequate).Disappointments:  More shutter lag than I'd hoped for, lack of manual controls (I knew that going in, but I do miss the flexibility I had with my Nikon), blurry pics in even moderate light without a flash (don't know if the shape makes it difficult to hold steady or if it's just a slower lens), more image noise than I'd like in ISO selections beyond 100.I did have to send the camera back to Canon once -- I turned on the camera while there was light pressure on the lens and the whole thing became inoperable.  They returned the camera in less than 2 weeks, which I thought was reasonable.In summary, this has been a nice little camera.  You're definitely trading off some flexibility for the size (Canon's G-4 isn't much more money and their A-80 is priced comparably.)  I find the images to be quite good.  The flash renders accurate flesh tones, unlike my old Nikon.  The biggest single negative for me is the shutter lag.  To capture moments well, you really need to be prepared, with the shutter halfway depressed (to lock in the focus).For a very detailed review, check out dpreview.  They're pretty evenhanded.","Date":"February 15, 2004"}

{"Title":"Excellent Snapshot Camera & Then Some","Author":"\"bdabean\"","ReviewID":"R39TSMFRT2ZKFR","Overall":"good","Content":"I graduated from a PowerShot S100 to the S400.Between the two cameras I've shot approximately 5,000 images.That's the point.You will carry the S400 with you because it's small, and you'll shoot a lot of images because it's easy to use. Over time you will find the major contributing factor to good images is sheer volume. Simply put, the more shots you take the more likely you'll capture a good image.Sure, you can buy cameras that have more megapixels and more features. Unfortunately they come with more heft. Once you've shoved a camera in your pocket, you'll no longer want one hanging from your neck. You can buy smaller cameras. But for me, this one feels just right. It slips into a pocket with ease. It's easy to hold and shoot. And it's not so small it feels fussy and insubstantial when you're taking pictures; it's just big enough that it won't disappear. Judging by my first camera, which has been dropped and repeatedly sat upon (I'm telling you, it's small) and used so much the buttons are almost worn out, build quality is excellent.The quality of your exposures on full auto will amaze you. White balance has been significantly improved since my S100, and whether shooting indoors or out the camera reproduces skin tones very well. (90 percent of everything you're likely to shoot will have a person in it, and if they look funny, the image looks funny. Skin tone matters.) If you're careful (good light, tripod) you can print enlargements to 8x10. Whether you print your own on today's better printers (use photo paper) or send them off to Shutterfly or the equivalent, in most cases they'll pass for film, rivaling even your best point-and-shoot cameras.Don't forget that unlike film, when it comes to digital photos you get a second chance because you can retouch your digital photos on your computer. You can use the supplied software or whatever came with your computer or pop for Adobe Photoshop Elements and \"fix\" many common mistakes, like red-eye. You may also find that you'll like shooting high resolution images to make prints from, then use your photo editing software to reduce the image quality, and hence size, for easy emailing. Despite my best intentions, most of my images live on the computer and not in printed photo albums. At 72 dots per inch (computer screen resolution) they look fabulous. By contrast, paper prints are 300 dots per inch, and far less forgiving. It's also cheaper to email an image--no paper cost, no ink cost, no postage.Film is still better than digital for a lot of technical reasons. The non-technical reason is the pictures look better. Especially if you're making big 8x10, 11 1/2 x 14 prints. But if what you're really going to be doing is point and shoot, do yourself a favor. Hang a full gallon of milk around the back of your neck and just reread this. That pain and the image library I've amassed explain why my very nice, very expensive Nikon film SLR, with its very nice lenses and very spiffy flash have been sitting in a closet for the last two years. And why I wouldn't consider carrying a camera much larger than an tin of Altoids.Two final comments. One, after being inundated with my digital photos and then getting their hands on camera, my wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law all own digital Elfs. Two, with the three minute movie mode this little camera will likely replace your video camera as well.","Date":"February 8, 2004"}
{"Title":"Quality Point 'n Shoot digital Camera","Author":"basketball dork \"dsterner5\"","ReviewID":"R38IE1NI0NW4Z7","Overall":"good","Content":"It's probably still too early to write an adequate and informative review for this camera that I've had for about 3 weeks now, but there were some glaring items that I felt needed discussion.I've been on the prowl for a digital camera for over a year now.  I decided to wait a while because I figured prices would come down and quality would go up.  That seems to be the trend.  I had thought for a while that I was going to end up with either the Canon A70 or the new A80, but at the last minute, I ended up with this nice little point and shoot camera, because that's exactly what I was looking for.  I was trying to convince myself that I needed all the manual features that the A-series offers, with their ability to use different lenses, etc.  But when it came down to it, I didn't really need all of that, simply because I have an SLR camera as well.  The main reason to get the digital camera was plain and simple: convienence.  The amount of features this camera has is outstanding, and you can play around with it for hours.  Even though the movie mode produces pretty fuzzy video, it's probably a feature I will use A LOT!Three critisisms I need to mention though.  I was surprised with how blurry some of the normal pictures can be, especially when the flash comes on.  It seems that when you have the camera in auto mode, and it detects low light, the flash will automatically come one (unless you have turned it off).  When this happens, it takes a little longer to take the picture and any movement of the camera produces a not-so-great pic.  I'm sure I just need to get used to the camera and how it works in each lighting situation, but for a point and shoot camera, I was expecting a little better.Also, accessing how much memory your card has left is a little tricky.  I just came back from a 2 week trip to Sydney, Australia to visit my mom.  I was very excited to use my new toy down there.  The first 3 days down there we spent on the sailboat and watched the fireworks in the harbour for New Years.  It was quite the experience and needless to say, there were some amazing shots.  By the third day I had taken over 100 pics and some video and wanted to know how much memory I had used.  In order to do that, you need to access a screen that asks you if you want to format your disk.  It also shows you how much memory there is.  I hadn't fully read the manual yet, and didn't know what that meant, so I ended up hitting \"ok.\"  Well, this erases everything on your disk, even protected images.  So all of my pictures I had taken were gone!!!!  Seems like a very stupid place to access your memory information.One other trait that I've noticed too:  There seems to be somewhat of a fish-eye effect on some pictures.  Especially more up close pics of people.  But I've heard this is a common problem in little cameras, esp. digital camers.Overall though, I've been very impressed and happy with my purchase.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it, especially when you can zoom into pics you've taken.  Some flower pics look really amazing with how much you can zoom and crop.I got a 256MB card, and an extra battery.  Typically I went through a battery a day on my trip.  The 256MB card is more than I need, though I went through almost two of them on the trip (a friend lent me his 256 card as well).  The camera was set on the highest quality settings though, so that ate up a lot of space.  All in all I had about 250 pics and about 2 minutes of video.I haven't dealt with the software yet, but I've read it's pretty good.Other than some of the bad luck I had with it so far, this is a great little camera.  You can't go wrong with it.  I recommend it.","Date":"January 16, 2004"}
{"Title":"A winner right out of the box!","Author":"\"da-unk\"","ReviewID":"R3PWBSSY1R5686","Overall":"good","Content":"I opened the box, loaded the battery & CF card, and started shooting pictures. The basic controls were easy to figure out in seconds. Some day soon I will read the manual to learn the advanced controls. 3x zoom is very useful. No red-eye. Automatic exposure control works well. A picture of large room was well lit and all parts of the room were easy to see. No dark areas. Like most digital cameras, you have to hold the button down and wait for the shutter and flash to fire. This makes action shots difficult. Cycle time is better than my previous two digital cameras. The only real down side is the proprietary battery. In the past I have purchased and loaded AA or AAA batteries anywhere. Now I have to recharge or carry a spare battery.The bottom line is: I use a digital camera for convenience. I purchased a Canon Digital Elph because its size makes it easy to carry. Therefore, I am more likely to have it with me when I want to take a picture. I purchased the S400 because I was disapointed in the 2x zoom of the S230 and 4 Mega Pixels gives me more cropping/quality options. I'm very happy with my choice.","Date":"April 1, 2003"}

{"Title":"A ziplock bag is all you need.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R89DQZ38GVFHK","Overall":"good","Content":"I can say that the canon was definitely worth the $$ that I spent on it.  Just like all cameras, there are pros and cons.PROS:-DURABLE:I took the camera up on the ski slopes of vermont to  take action shots and it held up to the beating I gave  it when I took a spill.  Now I don't know if I'd  recommend this to anyone else, but I just wrapped it  up in some toilet paper to absorb any moisture and  put it into a ZIPLOCK bag and placed the camera in my  front pocket of my ski pants.  Dangerous I know.  But  nothing broke.  Still works fine.-BATTERY LIFE:Now I don't have a spare battery, but the battery did  last a full week of taking about 100 pictures w/o  recharging at all while I was down in Dominican  Republic.  Granted I didn't scroll through the pictures  that I had taken to conserve battery life only b/c I  forgot to bring the charger with me.  I did have the  lcd on while I took my pictures.-PORTABLE:The camera is small enough to fit inside your pants  pocket and fits nicely in the inside part of your  sports jacket for those occasions that require  suit and tie.  I didn't want to carry my camera  in one of those small camera bags b/c then I would  either have to put it on a belt (which isnt' to my  taste) or it would be too bulky for the pocket.  So  I decided to just use a ZIPLOCK bag to keep the dirt  and water out, which worked out fine when I was  shoveling sand and rocks into the cement mixer.-PICTURE QUALITY:Overall the quality is good.  I've used the camera w/o  the flash several times to get the same light  contrasts that you would see in real life instead of  lighting up the object and having a darker  background (just my preference).  That normally works  out fine, but sometimes I have to lighten the picture  up a little after downloading the picture.  I've had  no problems w/using the flash in my pictures.CONS:-LCD:  This probably occurs w/ other cameras, but just as a  heads up, watch out for the plastic piece on the camera  wrist strap.  If positioned right (or rather not right),  the plastic piece can scratch up the lcd when stored in  the pocket or wherever you store it b/c it could rub  against the screen.-I'm sure there are other cons, but that's all that sticks out right now.-COMMENTS: I normally use the superfine, small picture mode so  that the file is small enough for my friends and  family who have hotmail accounts.  They can get  several pictures w/o completely filling up their  mailboxes.  Downloading to computer is quick and easy.  I haven't  upgraded to a larger memory card, but I would if I  was going to be taking several pictures and videos  before downloading, which I isn't a problem for me.  Videos is where it starts to eat up the memory.  Anyway, hopefully this review helped.  Good luck  shopping.","Date":"March 23, 2004"}
{"Title":"Not for the pro, but great for everybody else.....","Author":"Diane Simon","ReviewID":"R2JGUZ4VUHPFHH","Overall":"good","Content":"After owning countless \"regular\" cameras, including a 10 lb. 35 mm Nikon that gave me neck pain just carrying it (and 2 lenses) around, 2 or 3 Olympus \"point and shoots\" and various other mediocre small handbag-size cameras, I finally was \"born again\" and discovered the world of digital (about the same time I realized AOL was yesterday's news when it took half my life to download photos).  So, I did some research, thought about what was realistic for my life style, and decided to go with this baby.What a delight!  Very, very small and perfect for stashing in your pocket, briefcase, or handbag.  It takes good (not breathtaking) pictures that I suspect could be improved if I spent more time reading the manual. If you've never owned a digital before, this is an ideal model for a first time user.  First thing, get a memory card with a minimum of 128 mb so  you can play around without having to worry about downloading or erasing constantly.  Also, you will need to recharge the battery a lot if you are using the camera regularly.","Date":"September 29, 2003"}
{"Title":"PS400 sets the new standard for compact digital cams","Author":"pm444 \"pm444\"","ReviewID":"RS1DQOIJ4NSOJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I own and have been happy with a Canon ELPH film camera.  What I loved about the ELPH was its compact size.  It really is small enough to carry in your pocket.  Even better, I got some of the best photos I'd ever taken using the ELPH, mainly because I carried it with me much more often and as a result, ended up taking pictures I would have missed had the camera been sitting at home.For me, it was out of the question to sacrifice the small size when I made the move to a digital camera.  Fortunately, the PS400 is extremely compact and produces photos that are much better than the ELPH was capable of doing.A major advantage of a digital camera is being able to immediately see the picture that you have just taken.  This allows you to re-take the shot if someone closed their eyes, or if it's poorly composed, or the flash needs to be adjusted. The PS400 is set to display the image for a few seconds after you take the picture, but you can also switch the camera into view mode and look at it more carefully if you need to.Another big advantage of a digital camera is that you can edit the image after you have downloaded it to your PC.  This makes it possible for an amateur photographer to do what can only be done in a darkroom when you use film.  The download process itself is very fast and easy to do, whether you use the USB cable provided with the camera, or a Compact Flash card reader (which is quicker and will not deplete the camera's battery).  Once the image is on your PC, you can make all sorts of adjustments, using the provided software, or image editing software of your own choice.You may be thinking that you won't want to do much image editing, and it is true that the camera takes pictures that are ready to go without any editing.  However, you will probably find that you are taking a lot more pictures than you ever did with a film camera.  Unlike a film camera, where you take a full roll of pictures and then wait to see the results, you get immediate feedback with a digital camera.  If you like it, it stays on the Compact Flash card until you download it.  If you don't like it, you can delete it and take another one.  Having the ability to shoot large numbers of pictures at no added cost, and experimenting with lighting and composition allows you to improve as a photographer.  I would never have used an entire roll of film trying to get the best possible picture of one subject, but I have found myself re-shooting the same subject from a variety of angles and with different lighting with the PS400. It's fast, it's free, and you can get immediate feedback on what works and what doesn't.The camera can be connected to a TV monitor to allow showing pictures in a slide show.  I haven't used the video mode yet, which to me is a nice extra, but not something I had to have.I have been pleasantly surprised with the camera's performance in low-light situations, always an issue with point-and-shoot cameras.  I have had far fewer pictures with red-eye than I ever had with any other small point-and-shoot cameras. Even shots that were poorly exposed have been quickly fixed using the digital imaging software.The multi-zone focus system works extremely well and I have not yet had a picture that was out of focus.  The viewfinder tends to give a smaller image than you are actually shooting, so I generally use the LCD screen instead.  This can be problematic for outdoor shots, because the LCD screen is difficult to view in direct sunlight.  However, it has not been troublesome enough to detract from my enjoyment of using this camera.Despite its tiny size, the camera is easy to use, even for someone with large hands.  The buttons are actually more substantial than the controls on my ELPH, and the menu system is reasonably well-organized.I haven't had a battery run out on me yet, though I did buy an extra as back-up. The battery charges very quickly and the charging device is small and compact, with an AC plug that folds into the charger itself when not in use.  You can fit the camera, the charger, the PC cable, and the A/V cables, in a very small camera bag, and still have plenty of room for an extra battery, extra Compact Flash cards, and even the user's manual.The camera comes with a 32MB Compact Flash card, which is more generous than what Canon provided with previous PowerShot models, but still not large enough (it will give you about 15 or 16 images at the highest resolution and largest size).  Since each image is about 2MB, you need a card that is at least 256MB. You will also want a case for the camera, since it is not included.  I have found that Canon's PSC-50 case works well with the PS400.  It provides protection but does not make the camera too bulky to fit in your pocket.I know that some users have complained about the ArcSoft software that comes with the camera, but I have found it to be more intuitive to use than comparable editing software I've used in the past (including some of ArcSoft's previous products, which were not very good at all).  I feel that it strikes a reasonable balance between ease-of-use and a more robust set of features, and is well-suited to its target audience.  The Photo Record software that allows you to create photo albums is excellent.I love this camera.  It is changing the way that I take pictures, and what I do with them after I've taken them.  I know that nothing is perfect, but this camera comes close.","Date":"July 4, 2003"}
{"Title":"The most powerful compact digital camera out there?","Author":"Richard Go \"yusakugo\"","ReviewID":"R3FAFTS4I64YQM","Overall":"good","Content":"Canon's S400 is the second 4 MegaPixel compact digicam from a major manufacturer on the market (I consider Minolta's F100 the first).  Overall, the S400 is a winner for anyone looking for a basic point-and-shoot digital camera with a few added picture modes.  While the overall build quality of the S400 is slightly inferior to Canon's 3MP S230 camera... the bevy of features compensates for this.On the plus side is the 4 MegaPixel photo capture, 3x OPTICAL Zoom (which is way more important than what level of digital zoom it has), built-in speaker and microphone, 9 point AutoFocus system, improved user interface with the new FUNC button, DIGIC image processor which speeds up photo capture and improves photo quality, improved battery life over the older Canon digital ELPH even the S230 camera, up to 3 minutes of movie capture in various resolutions, and voice annotations on photos.  All of this in a camera that fits into your shirt pocket.  You also have a few manual settings if you desire with manual exposure control, white balance (with several preset values), some photo effects (sepia shots, B&W;, motion blur), and long shutter settings to name several user adjustable settings.On the minus side, battery life is somewhat short (150-170 in my use on a full charge), the flash is weak especially for low light and nighttime shots, you often will get red eye in your flash shots even with the red eye reduction (although it is greatly reduced), the off-center tripod hole makes it more difficult to have stitched photos, the limited manual controls versus other cameras in this price range, and the price of the camera.Overall, this a great compact digital camera best for vacationing and those who need an easy to carry camera with little operating hassle.  If you desire more manual features and professional level features, look at Canon's S45 4MP digital camera with is the same price as the S400.","Date":"April 6, 2003"}

{"Title":"Excellent compact camera","Author":"Omar Siddique","ReviewID":"R2VZ4W880Y9T32","Overall":"good","Content":"There are plenty of reviews written on the qualities of this camera in and of itself, so I will not go on about its small size, well designed interface, excellent optics, and so forth.I will, however, compare it to the S330, which is the older, 2MP/3X optical model that was the previous top of the line Canon elph.  Versus the S330, the S400:- Has a stepping zoom (7 steps) instead of a continual zoom- Is much more sensitive to camera jitter (shake) in no-flash low-light photography. If you plan to do that sort of photography, you WILL need a tripod.  This is the most sensitive (to shake in no-flash low-light photography) digital I've used yet.  Conversely, if you do use a tripod, those no-flash pictures come out REALLY well for the same reasons of sensitivity.- Has a less-easily scratched exterior material- Has different (better) laid out controls.- Has greatly extended battery life (improved battery and lower power consumption both).- Has a more intuitive menu for controlling features in manual mode such as ISO, whitebalance, etc -- and the menu can be manipulated on the LCD while shooting (without having to switch to the menu and then back to shooting).- And of course, the S400 is 4MP vs 2MP for the S330.What I'd love to see in a future ELPH:- Support for higher-speed flash memory, such as CF2.  Some elphs now support SD memory, but it's easy to design a camera to use both CF1 (what the S400 uses) and CF2 both.- Manual aperture control.- Better compensation for jitter during no-flash photography.Otherwise, this camera is wonderful and hard to beat without spending a lot more money for a bulkier camera.  In its size class, the S400 can't be beat.","Date":"December 23, 2003"}

Video mode is just amazing- that such a small thing can make a video- although when trying to e-mail it- it took a long time and I have not tried to tweek that at all yet - one thing I noted today was that dates dont stamp out on pics but if you buy a certain Canon printer the manual notes the date of photo creation will print out - overall I love this little camera and it about as exciting as your first computer ~ i did learn in my reading reviews of the ofoto.com website for downloading, editing, and getting your photos printed by them and receive thru the mail - that works great -I have a Nikon 35mm which has always taken beautiful photos but now ~ I must say - this Canon really beats it for sharpness and colors.

{"Title":"So small, with such big features","Author":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","ReviewID":"R5O82ZUDIF064","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera recieved great reviews from PC magazine as well recenlty while they compared it to a bunch of other ditigal cameras.  This happens to be the worlds smallest 4Megapixel camera.  Its heavier than it looks, but its hardly noticeable in your pocket.  I purchased a little camera pouch with a shoulder strap that makes the camera vanish behind your arm.  The camera seems very delicate, so I get worried when others handle it.  The LCD screen doesnt come with any protection so you have to be carefull not to scratch it.  The s400 has plenty of features like movie mode up to 3 minutes.  It also takes great panoramic shots.  As a matter of fact, it is possible (and easy) to take 360 degrees of pictures and stitch them together with the bundled software.  There are many features for advanced users, but it is easitly figured out by the thickest consumers.  The buttons, however, are small so they may pose a difficulty for folk with large hands or clumsy fingers.  the 3x optical zoom is great.  The 11x digital zoom is harldy used but handy.  The various flash options, focusing options, and ISO speeds can confuse people.  Im still learning how to take the best pictures depending on the light source.  Of course, there is always the Automatic option if you want the camera to decide for you.  Overall, it may be a bit pricey after you purchase a decent CF card.  The 32 MB card that comes with it is harldy enough room for the size of the pictures the 2400 can take when the resolution and quality are maxed out.  Go buy a 256MB card.  The cards can be developed at a walgreens or the data can be moved to the computer and then to a CD.  The CDs can be taken to be developed as well.  Lastly, the software included is pretty good if you like to edit, print, or arrange your pics.  Always, nomatter how great the camera, it still takes a good photographer to capture a good photo.","Date":"August 17, 2003"}
{"Title":"Great value, especially outdoors","Author":"MadKat \"slacker00\"","ReviewID":"R1X08PZUI84RSG","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera last year after my beloved S100 died after two years of faithful service.  The S100 was a prime example of how more megapixels does not equal better quality photos.  I took some panoramas while skiing in Banff.  One I blew up to 11x14 and it's simply breathtaking, always commented on by people who see it in my apartment.  And that was with a 2MP camera.  The S400 is similar to its predecessors, except for the higher resolution and 9 point autofocus & DIGIC processor.For well-lit situations, this camera simply can't be beat.  You can also use the photo-stitch feature to take huge panoramas.  Enough can't be said about the fact that this camera is truly portable.  It's only a little more obtrusive than a cell phone sitting in your pocket, and it's right there for you if you ever need to capture a moment, either with a still shot or video (which is surprisingly high quality).  The battery is great - easily lasts a day of shooting photos - just recharge overnight and you're good to go.  It uses CF cards, which can be had dirt cheap these days, and work with almost any adaptor.  (This comes in handy if, say, you run out of room while on vacation and need to download to a CD - most internet cafe's will have a CF-cardreader, while the same cannot be said of, say, a memory stick.)Drawbacks of this model are:(1) Slow response time between pressing the shutter button and taking the picture.  It's hard to capture those moments that require split-second response (baby smiling, etc.) unless you use continuous shooting.  To be fair, this is a drawback of nearly any consumer-level digital cam.(2) Poor performance in low light.  For some reason, pictures tend to get grainy when taken in low light.  This can often be made up for using photo editing software, and I've gotten big compliments on wedding photos I've taken in very dark settings.  However, the graininess comes out even in outdoor/cloudy situations.  A drawback.Some things I've figured out after using this camera for awhile:(1) You don't have to use the (included) TV adaptor to watch your photos on TV.  All you need is a stereo headphone jack to RCA cable adaptor, available at any Radio Shack.  Using this solution allows you to show/browse your photos on TV while sitting farther away.  Video goes to the red/right channel, audio goes to the white/left channel.(2) Battery charges very quickly.(3) Included photo software is the best of any I've seen yet at getting out red-eye.  On Macs, is OSX-native.  Pics are easily imported into iPhoto.  Use GraphicConverter for manipulating contrast/brightness/quality/etc.All in all, this is a great camera.  You won't be disappointed.","Date":"April 12, 2004"}

It's a great camera when it works, but Canon has no respect for it's consumers.  They ignore any problems, and furthermore, they want you to pay for their design errors.I have an S400 which was a gift from my sister back in late '03. On my suggestion, after reading rave reviews on the S400, she bought one for herself too ($400 x 2).Since Jul/Aug '05, I am getting the E50 error message and the \"memory card error\" which means I can't take pics. I can't reformat the card with the camera, as the reformat function withint the S400 itself doesn't work, so I bought a multimedia card reader to format the CF card, and that worked for a while, but now the camera is at best unreliable for taking pictures.I Haven't gotten the E18 (zoom lens retraction) on my S400, which is another problem plaguing this and many other Canon cameras, but after doing some research, I wouldn't be surpised if that starts to show up too.I can't believe that after all the problems people are having with Canon cameras, all what seem to be common problems, (E18, E50, E51, \"memory card error\", etc.),that Canon takes such a position to charge for their lack of quality control.For all of the many Amazon users who have bought this camera and/or other Canon cameras with similar problems, there is law firm out of San Francisco, Girard Gibbs & De Bartolomeo, that is investigating consumer complaints regarding Canon PowerShot digital cameras.  Sorry, can't give you phone number, mail addresses or URLs  by Amazon review writing guideliens, so just do a search on any search engine and you will find the info.I think we should all sue Canon for knowingly selling products that are faulty. We should also report Canon to the BBB.  Sue, sue, sue!!!! They only seem to listen when you hit them in the pockets, don't ya think?Put a faulty product out there, and charge for the repair? Now that's a profitable business it seems to me, even if it's not morally correct. Imagine if auto makers did that? Canon knows their cameras have problems and they choose to ignore the consumers complaints.Do not buy this Camera - you will get the MEMORY CARD ERROR eventually and Canon won't help you fix it, but they will gladly charge you for fixing it.

The con's people talk about don't seem like they are real to me. The flash is more than adequate for a normal use. I had a Nikon 775 and the best thing that ever happened with that camera is I dropped in and it died. It went back to service twice and never got fixed right. The S400 has a great macro mode, focus lock, auto exposure lock, long shutter mode... I really like the auto focus mode telling me where the camera focused. The Nikon chronically focused on the background instead of the subject even in portrait mode. Very frustrating. Also, the plastic case on the Nikon was not rugged enough. The Canon has a very solid case that does not flex. The battery life is great and I did by an extra battery for about $35. The Nikon battery life was much worse. The shutter delay and startup delay on the Canon is very short compared to the Nikon. Canon starts up in about 2 seconds vs. the Nikon which is over 8. The Canon also switches very fast between shoot and review mode. Also, the slide show through the video output is much faster than the Nikon.

I bought this camera just one day before I left the states so that I may preserve my experience for my familly.  I've gotta tell ya, of all the things I got in preparation for my year long tour this takes the cake!  The 4.0 megapixel pictures are CRYSTAL clear, and the interface is wonderfull.  I am a Mac user myself and downloading my pictures is a snap.  When I'm not around my computer, but one of my buddies is on his PC - zip, bam, boom, he's got pics just as easy.  The video isn't super 8, but it IS a whole lot better than I expected from a digital camera not much bigger than a deck of cards, and three minutes (with audio) goes a really long way!The extras are nice.  All the sounds the camera makes are changeable, and you can even record your own right there without hooking up to a computer!  It's rugged as hell too.  I spend a lot of time in the dirt out here and the camera has yet to fail me, nor has it taken any damage from all the bumping around that happens in my daily desert exsistance.The software included with the camera might be one of my favorite features.  There is a photo editor, a video editor, and a zoom browser.  I have iPhoto for the mac, but I find myself using the cannon software more often!  The video editor is great.  My wife sent me a little model tank.  When I got it together I had an idea....so I took about 100 pictures and made my own little stop motion animation film, with a soundtrack and everything!  The zoom browser is nothing short of awesome.  It helps you D/L your pictures fast and easily and will also erase your camera's flash card for you so you can start fresh (out here it's hard to find new ones).  It also contains a program called \"photo stitch\" that pieces pictures together for you to create a panoramic picture.All in all I've got to say this camera is incredible.  Whether experienced with digital cameras, or if this is your first, you'll have nothing but fun with it.  Spare yourself frustration...BUY THIS CAMERA!","Date":"February 4, 2004"}
{"Title":"Very happy with this product, though it's not quite perfect.","Author":"Steve","ReviewID":"RVCBL6NM976A6","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great camera, I love it and even though when I bought it a year ago it cost quite a bit, I have never regretted it.I have two batteries for it, one battery was just not enough for heavy usage of it.  I can get about a full day of heavy picture taking with one battery.  Ive gotten over 500 pictures taken with it on one battery, though sometimes i get much less. My premium memory card i bought ive noticed has greatly increased the battery length. Since there is no power-remaining display, it is hard to judge how much power you have left until it's too late.  Two batteries I find works great.  They charge rather quick.The 32MB card that comes with the camera is fine if you dont mind taking lower resoultion pictures with it, but I liked taking pictures at the max settings; I filled up that 32mb card in a few minutes you might guess.  So, I went out and bought a premium 1GB flash card.  I can usually fill it up with about 400 pictures just before the battery dies.The picture quality is great. In light the automatic settings are fine.  In the dark though, unless you use the flash, you will need to learn how to set the manual ISO and exposure settings because the automatic settings (flashless) arent so great in the dark as motions get really blurred.  A long exposure set in the dark also makes things become rather 'grainy', it still takes a rather nice picture.The camera it self is rather heavy for its size i find, but it is a really sturdy design.  Ive dropped it on concrete many of times with only a slight scratch.  AS you can tell i abuse this camera pretty heavily, but it still keeps on working.  The trigger button recently has started to get stuck a bit sometimes when pushed, but i think that is due to my abuse of it.the movie clip mode is pretty simple.  It only can take 3min clips with sound, 3 mins is okay though i wish it was unlimited.  The video quality is ok, but you cant zoom or get it to auto-adjust the exposure while recording.  THe sound recording quality could be improved, especially with being able to pick up heavy bass.  Heavy bass just seems to saturate the sound recording with a loud rumbling garble.  What im trying to say is that you cant use this to record sounds when you're at the movies or at a concert.This camera has a lot more to it then that, but everything else about this camera just seems to be just the way i want it.  It really is a great camera that will do a great job for taking pictures for a long long time to come.","Date":"April 18, 2004"}

{"Title":"Near enough perfect","Author":"A. Butterfield","ReviewID":"R3FNHMIYQ65JP","Overall":"good","Content":"This little Canon is ideal for somebody who likes to let the camera do the work most of the time, but occasionally likes to be a little more creative.It does a great job left to its own devices, with clever metering and focusing. The manual functions don't stretch to full manual control of aperture and shutter control (aperture priority would've been nice, to avoid - light permitting - the extreme differential focus effect you tend to get on close-ups,), but you do get control over metering modes, focussing modes, ISO, EV and various flash modes, as well as a `long shutter' mode that lets you det up to a 15 second exposure and invokes an excellent noise reduction system.I very much like the way you can adjust most of these directly from a button. It encourages you to be creative. Even when you do have to delve into a menu, it only takes a second. Canon's control system is one of the simplest I've seen, and I've had and used many digital cameras. This is a delight to use.It's nice to hold too, and has a big fat shutter button that you can't miss, even with big fingers. It reacts almost instantly if you pre-focus.The display is not the biggest around, but it's fast and clear, and even fairly usable in sunlight. All the indicators are clear and easy to see. The optical viewfinder is pretty good too, for such a small camera, despite the lack of parallax-correction marks.The zoom control is a little bit hit-and-miss though, and you find yourself going beyond the point you intended before it reacts properly.The pictures it takes are the most important thing though, and it's nice to see that the lens is up to the challenge of the 4.0 megapixel CCD. That high resolution is great because you can crop images quite a lot and still print them or view them at a  decent size. The images the Canon takes look at the same time crisp and natural, with little of that `processed' look I've seen from other digital cameras. If anything, the images start out a little flat, but a tweak of brightness and contrast brings them up to scratch. I'd rather this than get images that can't be tweaked in a photo editor without making them worse.Battery life seems quite good. The battery didn't last so long the first charge, but now keeps me going for a few days, even though I use the screen all the time and often review photos. There's no battery-level display until the battery gets low, which is slightly unnerving but doesn't really matter. A spare is a good idea.You can have fun with this camera too. By taking panoramas and stitching them together with the supplied software (works much better than I expected), or by setting the camera up to make different sounds for different functions. You can even record your own sounds using the camera's microphone. Once you start delving into all the things this camera can do, you wonder how on earth they pack it all inside.What don't I like? Well, to be honest, there's nothing worth mentioning other than the slightly clumsy zoom action. That's how good it is. I've changed cameras a lot over the last few years; it'll take something truly amazing to get me to swap this though.","Date":"June 16, 2003"}

But today all of a sudden I saw a memory card error. I am so upset. I am a student and I saved and bought this camera and now it died on me as soon as the warranty expired. Looking at the reviews people have written I found out that it was not just me, a bunch of other people have also faced the same problem. I almost cried when I saw my camera had stopped working. I also see from others that Canon has a sucky customer service. The memory card error seems to be a inherent problem with the camera and its not the consumer's mistake. Canon should repair it free of cost. Its a big company but looks like they dont know how to stay in business. I am never going to recommend any canon products to anyone from now on.","Date":"November 11, 2004"}

I love the menu system, how quickly the camera starts up, its size, how it feels in my hands, even the little sound effects it makes.  Browsing the images is also easy to do, fast, and gives useful information.All the professional reviews say the camera takes fantastic pictures.  My own personal opinion is that it takes fantastic pictures some times, and other times not so great.  Often the colors are too saturated in my opinion.  Many indoor pictures and flash pictures just look wrong, the wrong colors usually.The camera has just a few manual options.  One that's missing is one that allows me to specify spot focusing.  Instead, it figures out how to focus itself (and displays one or more green boxes in the LDC where it actually focused) and if it picks the wrong place(s), you have to release the button and try again.  Sometimes you just can't convince it to focus on what you want.  And ... of course, you need to realize all this is going on and pay attention or else you might end up with a bunch of duds.I still think this camera is probably one of the best quality small cameras you can buy.  We needed something to offset the bulk of the EOS 10D that we bought.  Once we tried that camera there was no looking back: you press the button, it takes the picture, no delay.  You HOLD the button and it takes 9 shots without stopping, 3.3 fps, 6 megapixels each.  But it is too big to carry everywhere...","Date":"November 16, 2003"}

Try it yourself!First I had a Canon A40. My second cam was a Canon S40. The S400 is my third digicam, and I won't sell it for a few years (at least Canon makes a newer and better from this series).What's the difference comparing to my previous digicams? The main: it's smaller and lighter. The second: it is faster. The third: it takes clearer pics like the other two. Also, it records 3 minute videos at 320x160. The manual settings are too few, but I don't miss them. I rarely used 'em on my S40 before. Not a big thing. I have ISO and white balance manual settings on my S400.Belive it or not, the battery of the S400 lasts longer than the one in my S40, though it's smaller and lighter.Reviewing pictures is a pleasure. VERY FAST! Compare it to Sony-P9 and you never buy a Sony after that. Compare low-light shots to any high-end ultra compact cam (eg. Minolta F100). You will choose Canon for that purpose also.What's wrong with it then? There is no battery indicator.

My first was an Olympus C-3020 zoom. I was very excited when i recieved that camera as a gift but as i began to use it i became very unhappy with it.  It is very bulky and doenst have audio capabilities like the S400. It also used 4 AA batteries which didnt last very long and added alot of weight to the already heavy camera. Needless to say i was very happy when it was stolen because i got the money from my insurance company which allowed me to purchase the Canon PowerShot S400.I was immediatley satisfied with the PowerShot S400. I love the audio & video capabilities and the camera is very easy to use. Also, there is no comparison in the size of the S400 to that of the Olympus. I am able to take this camera everywhere because it is so small. Also the Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery is great and lasts very long, even when you use the LCD screen for playback very often. I did a lot of research before i purchased a new digital camera after my first one was stolen, and i couldnt find a smaller camera with all the options that were included in the S400.I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this camera.","Date":"December 8, 2003"}

I bought this camera just before my recent trip to Italy, replacing a somewhat larger 3MP Toshiba that I've owned for a few years.  I wanted a highly portable camera that took great pictures and was resilient.  This is it.  If you don't have the camera with you when you need it, you can't get that great shot.  I kept the camera in my pocket wherever I went, and I ended up with a boatload of really fabulous shots.  Very few clunkers.  Super easy to use.  Color and clarity both excellent, dramatically better than my prior camera.  Backlight adjustment effective.  LCD viewer is small but extremely crisp.  Shots are quick, including shots in succession.  I'm a big guy, but I didn't feel clumsy handling this tiny camera.  I haven't invested a lot of time reading the instruction book, but what I needed I was able to find intuitively.  Software is functional and pretty easy to use for what I need -- downloading the shots to my computer, sorting through them, and emailing compressed versions to friends and family.  Bought a 256MB memory card, which should handle 125+ shots at maximum size and quality.  I picked this over the Minolta Dimage because the latter topped out at 3MP, and over the small Camedia because I didn't feel I needed to go to 5MP and didn't want the somewhat larger size.","Date":"August 7, 2003"}

Pictures are very sharp, and color is excellent (perhaps a little dark on the default setting, but this is adjustable). The camera is principally automatic point-and-shoot, with some manual controls/overrides for more advanced situations. The number of features is amazing for its size. The user interface design is excellent. The silver paint on the case scratched too easily by coins and keys in the same pocket. The macro capability make this a great ideal camera for shooting closeups of small flowers, insects, jewelry.

No  problems have arisen in over three months of use.  I have also experimented with some of the manual controls (macro mode and shutter length), with excellent results.My original conclusion stands; this camera's combination of size, speed, and quality is unrivaled in the digicam point-and-shoot market.I have nothing but praise for Canon on producing such a fine product (which is increasingly rare these days).My original review follows below.--------------------------------------------------------------I purchased the s400 less than a week ago and put it through the paces at a wedding last weekend.  I did wide shots,telephoto'd shots, indoor/outdoor, and even some videos.  It worked flawlessly.  Everything behaved as I expected, and the pictures I took came out well.I recieved a lot of compliments on the camera, with size, startup time, and image quality being the things people commented on the most.  Although I considered all of these things when I decided to purhase the s400, hearing this from other digital camera owners really solidified my conclusions and convinced me that I made the right choice.The bottom line on this camera is that it is very small and takes excellent pictures.  From what I have seen so far, I hardly think anyone could go too far wrong with the S400.The only drawback is the price, hence the four star rating, but IF this camera holds up for the next few months without throwing any kind of a techno-fit, I'll push my rating up to five stars.","Date":"June 9, 2003"}
{"Title":"Superb little guy!!","Author":"Sam \"kurokat\"","ReviewID":"RL6BKSHP2F3MC","Overall":"good","Content":"This little Canon is a dream. Enough manual features to allow your creative side to experiement and keep it interesting. Personally though, I mostly plan to use the S400 in auto mode for most pics though, as the shots are unbelievable for such a small camera in all settings. My former camera was a Fujii FinePix 6800 which is also a fine piece of electrical engineering, however, I prefer the 4.0 megapixel CCD as oppose to an interpolated system delivering 6.0 resolution derived from 3.0. The S400 is also much smaller, and feels more solid in the hand. Another plus is the unit is great at battery conservation, unlike some systems that drain the juice forcing you to not use the LCD. A real neat feature worthy of mention is the \"Mini Movie\" with sound feature which allows for two resolution settings and 3 minutes of capture. The only drawback with this little guy is the rubber cover for the AV and USB ports which in time will probably need to be replaced due to wear. I wish Canon designed a door type device for this purpose, but then again, rough users would probably break the door off. For this enigma, I suggest a CF card reader, especially if you do not use the AV ports like me. I just upload the files, and convert them to whatever format needed to play in whatever device I want, and burn them on optical media of choice, so I can leave the cover in place. None the less this is a camera I highly recommend for all users. The set-up is basically brainless for computer geeks, and simple for newbies. The S400 itself in usage is similar, in that newbies will take great shots in auto mode, and when they progress they will find the manual settings fun to play with. One of the useful manual features is the \"Stitch Assist Mode\" combined with the easy to use included software, \"PhotoStitch\" anyone can shoot awesome panoramic shots. Another neat feature, although fairly benign, is the \"My Camera\" mode which you can alter audio effects to make the camera sound like it has a mechanical shutter. You can even create your own sounds and personal pics to upload with the supplied software to replace factory effects. Lots of stuff in this \"Little Guy\" to keep you amused. Plus it takes superb pictures!PS Digital cameras of this size are a real pain to find proper sized camera bags, so here are two that I purchased for different uses.  The first is a Tamrac Digital Series model #5690 that has a velcro strip along with a clip fastener in front for secure carrying. It also has a small zippered pouch in front that can hold a spare battery and two CF cards in their case.  The second is Lowepro model D-Res 8S with a zippered opening. This is a more fitted case which has an acessory pouch within the bag itself that can hold one spare battery, and one CF card. You could probably squeeze another CF card in, but the fit will be a little tight.  Both bags come with shoulder straps, belt straps, and are made of ballistic nylon that is well padded.  Your Elf will not roll or shake in these cases. The Canon PSC300 cloth pouch is okay if you like the purple dinosaur color, and don't mind the lint it collects.","Date":"April 9, 2003"}

I've used another type of camera, the Sony Mavica, and while it takes 3.5 floppies or CD-RW discs that make it easy to transfer the pictures, what could be easier than simply plugging in a cable into your camera? Windows XP can be set to automatically transfer the pictures you took to a folder, so it's totally automated once you plug the cable into the camera and turn it on! Wow, what a feature.  This camera takes such beautiful pictures, I find myself carrying it with me all the time. It's perfect if you're a guy or a girl. It fits very easily into your purse ladies, or into your pocket men. The height and width are the size of a CREDIT CARD! It's only a little thicker than your big thumb.Some features I LOVE about this camera that you won't find on other cameras include:  **Zooming in on pictures you've taken [this allows you to zoom in to see the smallest details of a picture you took without loading it on a computer at all! good for seeing if someone didn't smile well]  **Ability to up to 6 of the pictures at once [makes finding a picture you took easy, no need to go through 18 pictures to find the one you want, instead see 3 screens of 6 pictures!]  **Panaronamic mode [take a series of pictures then \"stitch\" them together using the software they provide. this allows you to take a 360% picture if you wanted to!]  **Manual mode is loaded with options [adjust just about ANYTHING you can think of to make your pictures come out perfect. take pictures at night by adjusting the shutter speed]  **Macro mode [allows you to take CYRSTAL CLEAR pictures of things as little as 2 inches away! you can see details invisible to the naked eye in this mode]  **Auto-focus [this enables you to focus specifically on 1 aspect of the picture, someone's face for example. this ENSURES the selected area is perfectly crisp!].  You can take this camera's memory card to any photo developer (Wal-Mart is cheapest) and get amazing prints with NO editing at all. The 4x6 prints are of FINER quality than film! I could see individual whisker's on pictures of my cat!  Portability, though, remains my favorite feature of this camera. I can take it with me ALL THE TIME for those unexpected moments when having a camera is such a joy. You'll never miss the chance to capture anything!

You can fix the problem for $300, but for that price I would just buy another camera - not a Canon.  But those of you experiencing the same memory card error I have found a very simple way to fix the problem, which I will share with you at no cost.  I discovered this cure when I figured I had nothing to lose because I was going to throw the camera in the garbage. With the camera off, holding it vertically (like you would taking a picture), slam it down on a book or note pad that is on a very solid surface.  Slam it hard, you have nothing to lose, the camera is worthless, but don't break your hand or wrist.  Once should do should do it.  Turn the camera on, you should be back in business.

{"Title":"BUYER BEWARE of the Memory Card Error DEFECT!!","Author":"A User","ReviewID":"R36GPBKSATVGAR","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased the Canon Powershot s400 on Amazon in April of 2004.  This is our third digital camera- one other Canon and one Nikon- and this was the best of the three. For the most part, I was satisfied with the images, but many required red-eye fixing or tweaking of the levels. Bright light pictures were usually very washed out.  Shot-to-shot and powering up times were good. I would give the camera a rating of 3.5 or maybe even 4 stars if it still actually worked.I started getting a message that said \"Memory Card Error\" after about 14 months.  The message only happened on occasion, and I could power it off and on a few times and eventually the camera would work.  It was annoying- for sure- but at least still (sort of) functional.  Two months later, there was nothing I could do to get rid of the error message and the camera became completely useless.  It made it to the ripe old age of 16 months!  I called Canon, and they said I could send the camera in to their repair shop, and they would mail me an estimate.  When I explained the problem, they said that it would most likely cost on the high end of $150 - $300.  Even the service rep. said that it would not be worth repairing.If your heart is set on buying this camera, please don't do so without buying an extended warranty.  You will most likely be VERY happy you did.  I had to use my warranty (purchased at Best Buy) on my previous Canon, and the customer service was outstanding.  There was no out-of-pocket charge for completely repairing my broken camera.  They even took the liberty of replacing the outer pieces so it looked like a new camera.  My only (minor) gripe was that I was without a camera for almost two weeks.  Because Amazon was offering the S400 at $100 below Best Buy, I decided to take a chance this time and forgo the extended warranty.  BIG MISTAKE!!To those of you who have just purchased this camera, consider selling it before this defect sets in for you and the camera is worthless!Canon- I am SO disappointed in you!  This defect happens more often than not, and you won't recall the camera or do anything to help those of us who made a substantial investment little over a year ago.  I guess you knew what you were thinking when you gave the camera a one-year warranty.If I sound bitter, it is probably because I am...I can't afford to buy a new camera every year. The sad thing is, my next camera will probably be the Canon S2 IS because it is such a fantastic camera and I would like to have the 12x zoom capabilities.  But you can bet that I won't buy it without an extended warranty!","Date":"November 18, 2005"}

When I told them that I had researched this issue on line they said that all cameras have issues with these pins.  I tried to find other complaints on other cameras - nadda.Also was told that if Canon knew something was wrong they would address it.

They RMA'd the CF card and gave me a new one but found nothing wrong with it.  After googling the error I found many sites of many users' complaints of the same issue.I tried to make it work, found a trick where if I took out the CF card and battery and put back in it would solve the problem sometimes.  But the error got more and more frequent and now it's just sitting collecting dust.  $370 down the drain! I throught it would take me further than 2 years.

That all changed when the warranty ran out and the camera started giving the dreaded \"memory card error\" and wouldn't take pictures or let me look at existing pictures.  I tried reformatting the card using a PC but that didn't help, so I finally sent the camera back to Canon, thinking surely they would fix it for little or no charge.  Much to my dismay, I got an estimate for $155, which is Canon's fixed price repair charge.  They said I could buy a refurbished S410 for $195, which was just as outrageous, since I knew those cameras have the same problems as the S400.  I refused to give Canon any more of my money and they sent the camera back.  I am going to try one more thing to fix the problem, new batteries.  If that doesn't work, I'm going to join a class action lawsuit against Canon.  I found the following information on another website:\"If you would like to join the Lawsuit against Canon for \"Memory card error\" OR \"E18\" error CALL ATTORNEY JIM SMITH AT NO COST TO YOU REGARDING THE E18 ERROR.

{"Title":"Memory Card Error","Author":"telematiks","ReviewID":"R18UW4DPDFD5YO","Overall":"bad","Content":"Like clockwork, I experienced the dreaded memory card error after 18 mo (just out of warranty). I recently bought a new battery because the generics had such short lives and were a source of frustration for me. However, even with 2 canon batteries I only seem to avoid the memory card error temporarily. I'm hesitant to buy another Canon camera based on the reports about the 1) Memory Card Error, 2) E18 Lens error, and 3) fragile LCDs on the new SDxxx series that I hear about. Here are some tips for those of you dealing with the experience:1) I used photorescue to recover some of my pictures from my CF ( [...] ).2) At some point you may find it necessary to truly WIPEOUT your card if you are not able to reformat it properly ( [...] )3) Always keep your batteries fully charged, a low battery will increase the chances of the dreaded memory card error and render it useless until you remedy the memory card error (see Tips #1 & #2).I really loved everything about this camera, the 3min movie clips, crystal clear LCD, good quality photos (although I gave to edit the images to remove the extreme red hue in some of my indoor images), and compact size/weight. However, the rampant memory card error is inexcusable, warranting only a 1 or 2 stars. If you haven't or don't experience these problems, consider yourself lucky. ;)Note: I never experienced any of these problems with the s330 model. I had the s330 previously, which I gave to my sister. I'm sad to see that the new Canon models are having a lot of problems.","Date":"June 26, 2005"}

My first year with my S400 was great.  A little after that, I  started to get Memory Card Error problems.  At first, I tried reformatting the CF card using the camera, which sometimes worked.  I then replaced the CF card, and that worked for about 2 weeks.  I Googled Canon S400 memory card error and found lots of other S400 owners with the same problem.  The fix I hear about most is using a USB card reader to reformat the card in FAT format.  I've tried that, but the CF card still needs reformatting every now and then.

We just got our S400.  We've had a Fujifilm Finepix 1400 for about the last 3 yrs, but it is only 1.2 mp and larger in size than the S400.  The Fujifilm camera was a good one to learn on though and has helped us to understand a number of features on the S400.  If you are techno-savvy, go with the S400.  If not get a more simple camera to learn on.  The quick start guide is easy to get you going.  We also bought a case, 256mb simpletech card, simpletech card reader, and extra battery pack.  Don't buy a charger like we did as one comes with the camera.  I followed all the instructions and have had no problems taking pics and downloading.  To use the card reader you have to download the software for it from simpletech's website if you have win98.  The manual is sort of hard to follow for me (a non-techno), but the illustrations are helpful.  Haven't used the movie feature yet.  I would highly recommend a 256mb + card as only a 32mb card comes with the camera.  We use the card reader to save the camera battery.  The reader is only $11.","Date":"December 16, 2003"}

They have really worked out a lot of the irritating little quirks that I had on the S110. It's easy to get to movie mode, and the scrolling buttons when viewing photos are now 4-way instead of 2-way. Menu navigation is easier, and even deleting photos takes less steps. I was concerned about the casing not being as durable as the ones on the S110, and wasn't sure why they went differently with the S400, but the brushed finish just makes it look that way. The rounded corners actually make it nicer to sit in your pocket. The flash is more powerful, just everything. Obviously you pay more for all the upgrades....so if you don't really need 4.0 megapixels, then maybe consider the new SD100. But, the images and their new DIGIC chip are top notch.

The Nikon does a better job on high contrast photos (ie light sky with dark ground).  I've only been using the S400 for a month, so maybe I need more experience with the manual settings.  I do like the audio and increased video capturing time on the S400 over the Nikon.  However, the S400 does no alow for zooming in or out while recording.  It also does not change the apature setting while recording, which is a problem when panning scenes with high contrast(ie sunsets).Overall, it is a very portable camera that is good for general point and shoot pictures, but I will continue to look for a better portable camera for outdoor/lanscape photos.","Date":"July 7, 2003"}

{"Title":"Trick to Improve Shutter Response","Author":"C. Camera","ReviewID":"R3F6ASUZS0LS9L","Overall":"good","Content":"There are enough superlatives for this item in the reviews.  It suits my needs of quick informal photos.  I would like to comment and perhaps help those who report slow shutter response -- the time between pressing down and when the image is captured.I will agree with folks who state there is a noticable delay if you start from \"hands off\" to \"full down\" on the shutter.  I missed several shots the first several attempts.  (My kids are young and are constantly in motion!)  There is a trick which I'm not sure is covered in the manual.By pressing down HALF WAY, the camera will adjust focus and balance settings without taking the picture.  Then, from the HALF-WAY down position, when you press down FULLY, the camera will take the photo IMMEDIATELY.Wait, there's more!  If you release the shutter only to the HALF-WAY point (some practice required) then press down FULLY again, the camera will take another picture at the same focus/lighting settings IMMEDIATELY.  If you keep releasing to the HALF-WAY point, you can take pictures in rapid succession.  If you completely release the shutter then the camera will go through the process of focus and lighting settings again.So now, when I want to take a picture, before the subject is ready, I press down HALF-WAY and wait for the moment, then CLICK -- Gotcha!  Release half-way, wait -- CLICK -- Gotcha again!  For the most rapid successions make sure you set the LCD display \"after shot display\" to OFF.My wife was disappointed/frustrated with this camera until I showed her this trick -- now she LOVES it!","Date":"August 25, 2004"}

Low light conditions require extra light, but when the light is sufficient, pictures are far better than I ever got with my Nikon film camera years ago. It is my second camera to exceed film quality. The last one was a Canon also. The investment in digital is well worth it since you have zero expense after camera, extra cards, and card reader are purchased.

Since my warranty had expired then and Cannon at that time would not repair it for free, I decided that if it is a loose connection, maybe if I shake it violently the circuit will reconnect, and it did!! Everytime the error message comes up (and it does recur quite regularly), I just shake my camera really hard (by the strap), turn it off and on a couple of times, and the magic works.  Tonight I took the internal battery out and will check back in a few months to see if it will permanently resolve the issue. Because of the picture quality and I don't really need more than 4 megapixel, I still enjoy this camera.

The first two were Epson's and ok (the first one wasn't even 1mp).  The second one was 3.2 mp - nice and lots of features - but somewhat bulky for travel and lots of delay not only between pressing and actual taking of picture - but between shots too.This camera is great.  Compact and solid.  Portability is great when toting it around on trips, etc. Though small, it is still extremely easy to operate.  The time between pics is fast.  The pictures themselves are very good.  The display is crisp.The best feature:  photo-stitch.  The ability to take panoramic pics w/this camera is great.  Take a pic, see where it ends, line up the next one  and patch together.  The video features seem nice, but I've rarely used them on any other camera and not sure I will here either.I probably could do w/a 3mp camera - but the price for the 4mp wasn't much more.

{"Title":"nice disposable camera","Author":"shuksan","ReviewID":"R2W6E6BJUXSV1O","Overall":"bad","Content":"I got this camera because of the many positive reviews, the small size and the high resolution.  I was more or less happy with it at first.  It took good pictures in many situations and I'm not sure how many other point and shoot cameras would have done better in the places where it performed poorly.In particular, I was dissapointed by the autofocus in certain situations.  I tried the various focus options to try to work around this, but with little success.Other minor irritations: the camera frequently got quite warm, though not so hot as to constitute a burn hazard; the exterior finish scratches/wears off rapidly; it always starts up with the flash enabled (flash mode is not saved when camera is turned off).But after less than three months, it failed completely.  It would not even turn on.  So I sent it to Canon for repair.  They kept it for quite a while, before sending out a letter saying it would be repaired under warranty.  But then a short time later, they changed their mind, and declared that the camera had suffered extensive water damage and they would not repair it under warranty.  Naturally, since I had not exposed the camera to water, this was a surprise to me.  I also found it suspect that it took so long for them to discover that 'extensive water damage' was the problem and that about the only part of the camera that was still usable was the scratched up case.Bottom line: Canon wants $305 to repair a three month old camera that is supposedly under warranty.","Date":"September 22, 2003"}

{"Title":"fix for \"memory card error\", otherwise a GREAT camera","Author":"S. Brusco \"Sam Brusco\"","ReviewID":"R3CXCRU67ERXLF","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this camera for 4 or 5 years now.  It takes great photos easily.  Small enough to fit it your pocket, but not thin enough to break in your pocket when you sit down.  I've dropped it more times than I care to remember and it still takes great pictures.My only gripe about the camera is that it is FREAKIN' SLOW TO FOCUS.  I'm suprised that my finger has not gone through the body of the camera a few times in trying to get the darn thing to click.  But I say this about all digital cameras that I've used.  This probably depends on how much the battery is charged, but tell that to a 3-year-old who won't stand still or a whale that just jumped out of the water.By now, there are higher-resolution, faster cameras with bigger screens on the market, but I will stick with Canon when this one ultimately dies.  Their optics and electronics are excellent.Thank you so much schmalyn!  Every 2 or 3 years you will need to replace the internal battery to fix the \"memory card error\".  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.  I would recommend buying an extra one ($8 US) and keeping it with your camera stuff.  It would really ruin a vacation if you couldn't find a battery, although any photos that you had already taken should be safe on the card.Not only did changing the battery fix the \"memory card error\", but the function wheel (as I call it) now works too.  I had always assumed it was a physical problem.  The function wheel (with the manual overrides and movie functions) has not worked for 3 years -- maybe it never worked, but now it does.  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.A few comments, there are ELEVEN not nine screws, and I would suggest marking the body of the camera with a thin permanent marker BEFOREHAND.  The screws appear to be of different depths and thicknesses.  Have a big clear flat surface to work on.  As you take out the screws, line up the screws as you take them out.  When replacing the front casing, make sure to put the A/V Out rubber flap back in place.  Before replacing the back casing, make sure you line up the camera/play switch inside and out.I cannot be angry with Canon for the battery going dead, but I can be upset with them for not putting it in an externally accessible place.","Date":"July 1, 2007"}
{"Title":"Solid, Trusty Travelmate","Author":"B. Ko","ReviewID":"RVYM27XH5530W","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my S400 in May 2003 and fit it with a 1GB Lexar CF card.  This camera has been with me across 3 continents -- from -10C up to 40C climates -- and easily 17,000 photos in these 3.5 years.The camera is very solidly built, and has a reassuring heft to it.  The Celabrite finish on the front resists fingerprints and is pretty durable (except in the corners where some of it has rubbed off from roughing it in pockets/purses).  The S400 has a 1/1.8\" CCD sensor, which is larger than most of the subcompact cameras out there -- they have 1/2.5\" sensors -- and translates directly into better low-light performance before noise-reduction and processing can even start to help out.  Because of this, my next camera will definitely have 1/1.8\", regardless of its noise-reduction capabilities.This was also one of the first cameras to sport an \"orientation\" sensor, meaning it \"knows\" which way you're holding the camera when you're taking the shot, and inserts this into the JPG's EXIF metadata.  But while normal images are named IMG_xxxx.JPG, the movie files are named MOV_xxxx.AVI, meaning in a normal listing view, they don't show up in chronological order interspliced with the images.  And I don't believe the movies have datestamps on them besides the file timestamp.  Anyway, for today's standards, the movie quality (resolution and frame rates) leaves something to be desired.The custom white balance on the S400 is quite good, and saved me from having to do a lot of postprocessing to \"un-yellow\" some photos.Focusing on this camera is a little slow, and is definitely audible.  But if you plan to take a lot of photos of the same subject (or at the same distance), you can lock the focus once you have it, and keep shooting without re-focusing.  This also shortens the shutter lag!  Ditto with exposure lock, which is useful if your picture has a wide range of lighting conditions and the best exposure isn't necessarily in the middle or detected by the camera.A second (and third, maybe) battery is a definite requirement if you go for day trips, because like all Canons, the S400 doesn't show how much battery power is left!  You get a flashing red battery sign, meaning you probably have 5-10 shots left; twice that if you turn off the LCD and flash.  I found that on vacation, I would go through two full batteries per day.  Sidenote: my second battery was an aftermarket with slightly higher capacity (900mAh over 840mAh), and it was 1/4 the price and lasted great until recently, when it stopped holding much of a charge.There have been, of course, many complaints about a famous \"memory card error\", but I haven't had it happen to me.  [...].Sadly, some 5 hours before New Year's Eve 2007, my camera refused to power up.  It didn't make it into 2007, but it gave me a great run for the money!","Date":"January 3, 2007"}

Yes, there are smaller cameras on the market but almost all of the smaller cameras lack an Optical zoom lens.  I wouldn't purchase a digital camera with out an optical zoom lens as I use it quite frequently.  Me, being a guy, and therefore not carrying a purse, I found it really easy to carry this camera around in my pocket when traveling.  I have felt so free on vacation now not being burdened with holding a camera or asking my wife to hand my the camera from her purse whenver I want to take a picture.  It makes vacations that much more enjoyable.Ease of use:I find the auto mode useful frequently.  My wife is not a technophobe and enjoys the easy point-and-click ability of this camera and most of the time it works quite well.  I do use the manual mode quite often to optimize for lighting conditions.  I also appreciate the easy ability to disable the flash with a separate button on the back as I frquenty turn off the flash for indoor pictures when there is plenty of light.  I do find the flash to be a little harsh for indoor pictures when there isn't a lot of light.Cons:As several people have pointed out, upgrade the memory card size immediately to at least 512MB so you don't ever end up filling up the camera.  I recommend learning to download pictures on to a computer straight away and burn them on CD for long-term storage.Buy an extra battery.  There really is no warning when the battery is dying.  Once the warning hits, you will be lucky to get one more shot off.  I got burned on my one (and probably only) trip to Mt. Fuji in Japan and ran out of juice half way through the trip.  I do like the small size of the battery charger and it works quite well (no chords!).","Date":"January 12, 2005"}

Mine failed only shortly out of warranty with an E18 error.  Search the net for \"canon e18 error\" and you will see hundreds of similar problems.  A little research seems to indicate that the MTBF (mean time between failures) is about 16-18 months on this and several other Canon models. A high percentage of cameras are failing.  I see no signs that Canon has any intention of doing the right thing, all they will do is try to charge you more to repair it than the camera is worth.While it works it's a good camera and takes decent pics, but this price for a camera that becomes a useless hunk of metal at 18 months is truly unacceptable.","Date":"May 13, 2005"}

My previous camera (Canon G2) did a great job but since I travel frequently I wanted a camera that was more compact and easier to carry.  I \"test-drove\" the latest cameras from Canon, Casio, Kodak, Konica, Nikon, Olympus, Samsung and Sony. This camera blew all the others out of the water by a mile.  My highest recommendation!

{"Title":"Stay Away from Canon PowerShot S400","Author":"Wine Teacher","ReviewID":"R3D1T1QGRPY1DM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had this camera for about a year and a half.  The first problem occurred about 6 months after purchase.  The connection on the camera was no longer in good shape.  The only way that I could download was to use a card reader.  Next, after another couple of months, a screw on the tele-photo switch broke causing difficulty in using the tele-phone switch at all.  I had to hold down the switch every time I used it.  Then, it started burning out batteries.  I ended up having to buy three additional batteries.  One burnt out the second time charging it.  Next, after about a year and a half from the time of purchase, the card error problem occurred.  It destroyed several 256 cards and it was no longer working as a camera at all.  For $500 plus another $300 in extra cards and batteries, the camera is completely dead.  Canon has not been responsive.  It is obviously a \"dog\" as so many customers have complained about the same problems, especially the problem with fouling the memory cards.  This is a complete failure in quality control on the part of the manufacturer (Canon)and a complete failure on Canon's part to back it up.  For as reputable a company as Canon, it is a complete breakdown of confidence.  They should be ashame of themselves for making this, for selling this and for not backing it up.  So many have lost millions of pictures.","Date":"May 23, 2005"}

The white balance adjustment works well and the metering is very accurate. It is a good idea to buy an extra battery as there is no battery meter so you really don't know when you will run out of juice.  The battery is small and carrying an extra battery is easy.  The optional case is very handy.  The camera comes with a wrist strap which is a safe and unobtrusive way to carry this little wonder when you are out and about shooting.I had been looking for a small camera to take with me everywhere with excellent image quality and now I have it.

It is in my opinion, comparable to the Sony P10 in most aspects, except, the sony is longer but shorter in height, thickness about the same, Canon is boxier, but fits in small bags or pockets. Sony P10 is also nice an cute. Sony is better in terms of being 5 MP, canon, only 4 MP for the same price. Canon can stitch pictures together right on the camera, Sony cant. Canon has orientation sensor, Sony no.Compact flash for Canon is a better deal in terms of price per memory,memory sticks are about double the price, but the I opted for the Sony because the Canon lacks the presence of any kind of low battery warning. It only tells you a few seconds before it dies , and then, oops! Sony and the minolta both have battery warning, the Sony can even tell you how many minutes are remaining on your battery life if you get the DSCV1. Sorry, but if I need to take a once in a life time shot, and the battery dies out, I dont think a spare battery nearby will help unless I can change it in less than a second. Otherwise, great camera, highly recommend.","Date":"August 4, 2003"}

It is easy to carry with you anywhere in a pocket or a small case and that's important because a camera only counts if its with you. The outer casing is very sturdy (and attractive) and will protect your camera from bumps and falls.The biggest improvements over my previous canon S230 are the additional megapixels- 4.0 and the 3x optical zoom.  Both these improvements are important to the quality of prints- especially to enlargements.  An optical zoom takes much crisper shots than a digital one and 3x enlargement is superior to the 2x in the S230 and other small digital cameras. The 4.0 megapixels also provides a sharper picture again especially for enlargements. I do reccommend purchasing at least a 256 Megabyte card to accommodate the extra data you'll be storing. And buy an extra battery so you don't run out of power unexpectedly.This is a great camera and so easy to use that anyone can take great photos in no time.

The print image quality is outstanding. The camera, even though it is tiny, has a very \"sturdy\" feel. After weeks of research, the decision was between this camera and the Canon S45. (I had included the Canon S50, but had read reviews by many professionals stating that the 5 megapixel cameras are just not necessary. Except for those who intend to print large.) The S400 does not have the manual features of the S45. If you intend to do more fine arts work, then you should take that into consideration. But if you want a great (so far), small point and shoot then this may be the camera for you.I am giving 4 stars because of the high price and the lack of manual features, other than those points, it is a 5 star camera.Update: January 26, 2004...LOVE the camera.

It has an all metal body, with everything you need to get started.  After I charged the battery (which takes about 90 minutes), I had this camera mastered in about an hour.  Now that can be good and bad. For folks who want a great camera for vacations, the holidays and just for fun, this camera is the one to get. If you are a professional photographer, you won't find a whole lot of manual control. You'll find some, though.  Now, at the highest resolution, which is what you'll want to shoot with, pictures come out absolutely fantastic!  I would suggest getting a memory card to hold these (the one that comes with it only holds 14 pictures). I have a canon s9000 photo printer, and it prints amazingly clear 13x19 shots.  That's big! And it's all due to the outstanding performance of this miniscule camera!I only have two complaints with this camera...Poor red-eye reduction (It comes with tools to fix it but it's a bit of a hassel when 1 out of 5 pictures come out with red-eye)Poor background lighting (when you take close-ups with people the background always turns out dark. This is because the flash doesn't have as big a range as it could have, but I can deffinitely live with it.)All in all this camera is worth the money!

The camera is virtually destroyed because it was exposed to...humidity outside!  This camera wasn't dropped in a puddle, left in the rain, or anything dramatic like that.  I took it outside on warm humid days, and according to Canon's service department, that was enough to render it utterly useless!I see from other reviews that I'm not the only customer who has experienced this problem.

{"Title":"Great camera for a while, then memory card errors everywhere","Author":"Ryan P. Liegel","ReviewID":"R12H58WBZY7Q3X","Overall":"bad","Content":"As everyone seems to be, I also have experienced the famed \"Memory Card Error.\"  The camera worked really quite well (other than one early E18 error covered by warranty) for about 26 months...but now is practically unusable due to memory card errors.  At first, they would just be intermittent...and a format or simply turning the camera off and back on would fix them.  Now, however, \"memory card error\" is essentially permanantly on my screen.I've tried multiple batteries, fully charged, air-dusting the CF compartment, multiple CF cards, re-formatting the card, and nothing seems to get rid of the problem.Other than the memory card error, it was a quality camera though.  When it first came out I was that guy with the really cool new camera, and I still appreciate Canon's attempt to put out a cutting-edge model with good quality in a small size.Now, however, I think that Canon needs to recognize the prevalence of the problem and propose some sort of a solution for camera owners.  Many owners of this camera would certainly have upgraded to a new Canon elph if they had not experienced the untimely death of their camera.  Canon should issue a recall, or at least provide service past the date of warranty.  If not, Canon is really risking the future of their camera sales by alienating their customer base.I've already ordered a new SD500...I'm sure I'll love it as I did the S400, but I only hope I can love it a little longer this time.","Date":"July 7, 2005"}

We are sorry to hear of any issues with the PowerShot S400 detecting a CF card.I do apologize, but Canon USA does not monitor, confirm, endorse, or attest to the accuracy of any information posted on third party websites.

{"Title":"MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH SKIN TONES AND FLASH","Author":"Eddie","ReviewID":"RXIVB4TCX7ODO","Overall":"bad","Content":"Look, a great number of people I know exclaim about how great Canon's are in general, especially the S400. I am going to talk about why the Sony DSC P10 destroys the Canon S400 and to address the gripes of other reviewers.The only advantages the Canon S400 has over the Sony P10 are as follows:1. Flash is more centered over lens of camera to avoid \"shadow\" effect2. Compactflash memory is cheaper3. Double sided memory sticks are \"bad\"4. The S400 has 9 points of autofocus, compared to the P10's 3Yes, I know the flash on the Sony is not centered over the lens, thus in theory it would cast shadows over the subject, BUT in practice, THIS HARDLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. For the most part, I have not even noticed that this was possible, but in those small instances if I payed extremely close attention, I could notice that something small and insignificant placed in a very specific way in front of the subject was casting a slight shadow on the subject in like 1 in 100 of the night pictures I take.This is FAR outweighed by the fact that Canon's in general, and this PARTICULAR Canon, has THE WORST lighting problems I have ever seen. SKIN TONES, COMPLETELY wrong. Canon has a history of problems with underexposing color tones and this camera is no different. Using TWO different A400's, the skin tones of people in the pictures often comes out terrible. People's skin often comes out EXTRAORDINARILY yellow and fuzzy. I am not sure what causes this problem, but this ALONE renders the camera completely useless in mild light conditions. Go develop some night pictures off the A400 before you buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about. The skin tones come out all wrong and it is obvious to almost everybody. Especially if you are Asian! They're not THAT yellow! Compare the pictures side by side to the Sony P10 and I guarantee you can tell.First of all, compactflash memory is only cheaper than memory sticks if you don't know how to shop. Sure, if you buy a Viking Compactflash card then it'll be cheaper, but then again you shouldn't be doing that anyways since Viking makes dangerously terrible cards. Furthermore, if you shop on amazon.com, you can buy a 256MB SONY brand memory stick for practically the same price as a reputable maker of a CF card!I agree, that memory stick pros are not that great since they have that really odd copyright protection, but if you plan to only put pictures on this card, then that should not even be an issue. Also, people have complained about the \"double-sided\" memory sticks and how inconvenient they are. Both me and my dad have one and we actually think it's better than a conventional 256MB stick. First of all, if you have an MP3 player then it would be nice to keep MP3's on one side of the card and pictures on the other. You don't want to mix the two, and it's a great way of dividing it. Why would you not want to mix the two? Say you wanted to format the card to delete all your pictures so that you can take a whole new round of pictures. If you had a 256MB compactflash, you would delete all your MP3's as well, or you would have to delete each of your 100 pictures one by one.With the double sided stick, you can just delete one side at a time, leaving all your MP3's. The same holds true if you are just taking only pictures as well. If you want to keep some pictures or movies on your card for a presentation or demonstration on a TV, then you can keep those pictures on one side of the card, and then continue formatting and taking pictures on the other side freely. And when you do have to switch the sides, it really isn't annoying at all. You just take out the card and move one button. This is far easier than tying your shoes. So one reviewer named tmchow complained on switching sides to the memory stick that it was \"Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it\"He must wear velcro shoes or something, because if you can do simple things like tie your shoes, SURELY you can press one button, really it's not hard at all.And WHY on EARTH would a non-professional photographer need NINE points of autofocus?!? That would mean you would like to focus on an object NOT in the center of the picture and leave everything else blurry. So this spectacular feature would come in handy in the following situation, you are taking a picture of two people at a restaurant but you would like to focus on the salt shaker, but leave the two people fuzzy. USELESS. So basically if you would ever like to focus on something completely outside the center of the picture but leave the remaining 90% of the picture fuzzy, buy this Canon for the wonderful autofocus flexibility.So let's look at why the Sony P10 is clearly better:1. I like people's skin to look like how it does in real life.that ALONE should be enough, but let's carry on2. Sony P10 is 5 megapixel3. 20% longer battery life, VERY important in digital photography4. Takes great pictures in the dark, and even has a solid night modeSome people get completely lost in megapixels and think that more megapixels is better and forget the rest of the camera. Not true, megapixels only matter if you are blowing up your pictures to uncommon and extravagant sizes like 20 X 30. In this case, the Sony P10 takes far better night pictures as well as having more megapixels. But if you really insist on messing up everyone's skin tones, go right ahead and buy this camera.People keep talking about how compact the A400 is. Well, in my experience, pants pockets generally are rectangular, not square. Making the Sony P10 a far better fit when it comes to a conventional pocket.Overall, Canon cameras are completely overrated by all those blind Canon lovers. Don't be biased!","Date":"March 16, 2004"}

Since it has a much-more-than-adequate 3.2 megapixel sensor, I can only conclude that the innovative optics in the camera are not up to the task.I would rate the picture quality about the same as -- or even lower than -- one would expect from an old Instamatic point-and-shoot.  At this price, the Xt should deliver much higher picture quality than that.I have returned the camera, and ordered a Canon digital elph to replace it.","Date":"November 16, 2003"}
{"Title":"Good size and price but disappointing picture quality","Author":"Ben McEachern \"BenMc\"","ReviewID":"R2GEGHITNGFWZG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned a Fuji F401 for over a year and been very happy with it.  I decided to get another digital camera and picked this one due to it's even smaller size and the fact that the video length is only limited by the size of the memory card.  Also, it uses SD memory, which I prefer due to it being cheap and available in sizes up to 512MB.  I've found that in spite of it's small size I have no trouble operating it.  I am very happy with it's features and quick response time when navigation menus and managing (reviewing, deleting, etc.) photos and videos.  I don't mind the small LCD and I manage not to get my finger in the way of the lens. My only major disappointment is the picture quality.  I find it very challenging to take a nice picture.  I get blurred, dark or poorly colored shots much of the time.  While the Fuji doesn't have the control over Exposure, White Balance, etc. this one has, I could just fire away with it and get pictures that were brighter with better color and in focus more of the time.  Many of the pictures I take are indoors, which seems to be a particular challenge with the Dimage Xt. The video quality is worse than the photo quality in low light situations.  Much worse than my Fuji in the same conditions.Also, althought the startup time is short, there is a long delay between when you push the button and the picture actually takes, at least when using the flash.  This has caused me numerous missed shots of my rapidly moving 2 year old.  Maybe I will learn the best settings for each type of shooting I do and improve the percentage of good photos I take, but I'd prefer not to have to do this.  I will only use this 3.2MP camera as a backup to my 2MP Fuji.","Date":"November 15, 2003"}
{"Title":"A tale of woe courtesy of Minolta","Author":"Joseph F Grcar","ReviewID":"R1KQ7VJ2ES5IBQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Wall Street Journal's gadget column recommended the earlier but quite similar version of this camera (Dimage Xi) so I purchased one from Amazon.com for the Holidays in 2003. The small size is a delight and when the pictures are good they are great and very easy to download to my personal computer (this may be because I have a Macintosh). However, my first extended use of the camera was on a trip to Japan. I discovered that almost anyway you hold the camera to steady it will place a finger in your photo because the rather wide angle lens is recessed into the body and does not pop out during use. I told myself that I would get the hang of it eventually but in the haste of a Kodak moment I always seemed to forgot where my fingers were. About half the pictures from my Japan trip were obscured in this way. Things went downhill from there. The next extended use was during a family outing. I was happily snapping away but now taking my time to frame each shot (remember the finger). About midday the battery died. It turns out that the battery has a rather short life, particularly if you leave the camera on for a few minutes with each picture to play with the zoom and show off your photo. So I lost half a day of family memories. But its gets better. We spent the 2004 Holidays in Europe visiting friends we had not seen for many years. Right in the middle of recording our vacation the camera stopped working. At first I thought it was the battery but a trip to the experts at a big Minolta dealer confirmed that it had died. The dealer said it would take over two weeks to repair in Europe and we were flying back in less than that (and we had none of our purchase receipts and warranty material) so we decided to repair the camera back in the USA. Upon our return I called the number in New Jersey and followed instructions to mail the camera to the repair center. Nothing prepared me for Minolta's idea of customer service. A few weeks later I got a bill for $110 (half the cost of a new unit) to examine the camera with a promise of more costs if something really bad is wrong (more about this later). What about the 1 year warranty? Well, the Minolta customer service people tell me the 1 year only covers the time from date of purchase to receipt of the camera in New Jersey. If you are out of the country when the camera breaks (and not likely carrying the warranty documents to tell you what to do) you are out of luck. Finally, the invoice says Minolta is not responsible for damage due to dust in the camera even if it is under warranty. So I did a little checking around. It turns out that the innards of this camera are not well protected. In fact, I gather that when the lens screen is open just about anything can fall inside and do some real damage. So this is definitely not a camera you want to keep in your pocket even though that is its major selling point. For the record I kept mine in the leather belt case that I bought from Minolta. I cannot recommend this or any Minolta camera because at least one of them has some serious design defects and the manufacturer's warranty service is flawed, to say the least. Bottom line: don't believe what you read in the Wall Street Journal (but my friends who swear by the Washington Post have been telling me this for years).","Date":"February 11, 2004"}

Only after a few shots I realized that the pictures were not as good as I had expected.  In fact the pictures weren't even half as good as my 2.5 year old 2.0 MP kodak DC3400 camera.  At first I thought that maybe I did not understand the camera settings.  But after reading the manual and trying to take pictures in different light conditions and settings, I have realized that it is futile to try to make this camera take better pictures.  The pictures are grainy in poor light conditions.  They are soft even in good light conditions.  The camera is also very sensitive and the pictures often get blurred even with the slightest hand motion.The good seems to be the cool factor (which is why I bought it), and the use of SD cards (which I think is the way to go).  But after having used it for sometime now, I have realized that the poor picture quality of this camera outweighs the cool factor, and this camera will go back to where it came from.  I will probably end up buying the canon S50 instead.","Date":"February 10, 2004"}

I bought the Minolta, because of its size. I wanted something to fit into my pockets basicly for snap shots. I have had this camera for a little over a year. I have had problems since the begining. The lens cover stopped working after about a month with the camera. I sent it in and it was fixed under warrenty promptly. A few weeks later it broke again, this time in the down position. I never bothered getting it fixed since I could still use the camera. Lately the camera turns on but no image will show up and I will not be able to turn it off. I take the battery out and sometimes it will work other times not. Since it is no longer on warrenty I am dealing with the problem and looking for another camera. To put money into fixing a bad camera does not make any sense.  The camera took fine photos, was easy to use, extemly slow lag time taking pictures, and the reliablity is non exsistent. I paid almost $400 and expect the camera to work better then it did. The lens cover is just a bad design. I will bet Minolta is fixing this camera a lot.

Reason?  Extremely slow shutter response and blurry photos.  Typically 3 seconds to infinity to take the picture.  I say infinity because about 10% of the time I would push the shutter release and nothing would happen.  Not the photographer's fault, I've been an amateur photographer for over 25 years now.  I know how to hold a camera steady, hold my breath and gently push the shutter release button.  Of the pictures it would take, most of them were blurry.  When it would take a good picture, it was VERY good.  But I want most of my pictures to be decent.  This was a backup solution for when lugging my Canon EOS 10D was impractical.  I didn't expect it to take Canon quality pictures but I did want them in focus and less than 3 seconds \"thinking time\" after pushing the shutter release.  It failed in those areas.  It had a major failure recently with a 512 MB SD card.  I don't know if the camera failed or the card, so I won't point fingers.  All I know is that 300 MB into the card I received a \"system error\" message and couldn't take any more pictures.  Again, unacceptable.  Buyer beware.","Date":"September 4, 2004"}

Wush I hadn't bought it.1. The viewfinder is nearly useless since it does not show the anywhere near the full area of the actual picture taken. So when it is too bright or inconvient to use the display on the back of the camera, framing the subject is guesswork; I nearly always end up cropping the image.2. The automatic exposure for flash is at least one f-stop too little, but OK for non flash exposures. So when taking flash pictures I have to keep going into the custom1 menu to set the exposure compensation to +1.0.  I often forget to set or reset that setting, so I have a lot of badly exposed pictures.3. The little wrist strap that they stongly advise one to use has  a plastic fastener which scratches the display window, with the result that I was unable to return the camera to Amazon as I wished. Should have bnever used it!The small size and the fast action are delightful.

{"Title":"Doesn't deserve to be called a Nikon","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1CLBQZPQFJYGQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"In recent weeks, I put many hours into researching the pros and cons of particular prosumer cameras; finally I settled on the 5400, a camera that was to be an upgrade from my three-and-a-half-year-old Nikon Coolpix 990. The old 990 had proved to be a dependable workhorse; other than some self-inflicted problems that occurred after I spilled some sugary soda on it (I had to have it professionally cleaned to the tune of $200!), it never let me down. Still, I'm getting more serious about my photography, and wanted something with better resolution and more advanced options.I had been really looking forward to receiving the 5400 and was predisposed to liking the camera a lot. In reality, I soured on the thing within 72 hours.First of all, BELIEVE what camera cognoscenti say about the inability of the 5400 to autofocus in low-light conditions. What I hadn't understood until I was shooting with the camera is that 'low light' doesn't necessarily refer to broom closets or dinners by candlelight. I was snapping pics of my two-year-old in the living room today, on a sunny afternoon, with the blinds mostly open. Half the time, I couldn't get the camera to lock no matter what. Moving to the hallway, where there's only indirect light sthat streams in from the living room and dining room, effectively rendered the camera inoperable. I encountered no such problems outside, so if the great outdoors is where you do all your shooting, the 5400 may be for you.Except for one other thing -- and this is a biggie. What absolutely DESTROYS this camera's performance is its pathetic color accuracy. Maybe I got a lemon -- I find it hard to believe that Nikon, the top-of-the heap manufacturer of pro-quality imaging equipment, would release a model that is so wildly off in how the internal chip processes color. But at least with the specimen I have, all the colors come out hyped. I photographed a still life that included some salmon-colored paper; it acquired a distinct, troublesome reddish tint in the picture I took with the 5400. This is a CRITICAL area for any camera; if it doesn't render reds and pinks accurately, it's an almost useless tool, as Caucasian faces, especially, will look ruddy and unappealing. And my 5400 has trouble with other hues, too, first turning a purplish blue shirt into a something much more like ROYAL blue, then pulling the exact same feat with a baby blue yogurt lid in another still life. It makes no sense to me either, but there it is.I spent HOURS tweaking white balance and playing with the camera's saturation settings, all to little avail. Was the 5400's (too-small) display at fault, perhaps, as opposed to its internal color-rendering chip? I wish. After transferring the pictures to my Mac G4 and opening them in Photoshop 7, the same problems were immediately evident on the big monitor. To a degree, the 'off' colors can be corrected in Photoshop, of course. But sorry Nikon, I'm not prepared to do that kind of digital cosmetic surgery on virtually every picture I take.My old Nikon 990 has better color accuracy by a mile; so does a more recent four-megapixel Canon A70 point-and-shoot that a friend was using to photograph the same test scenes on which I trained the 5400.I should note that I am not a professional photographer, and that I'm probably much more forgiving of mild deviations in color and sharpness than a pro lensman would be. But the problems I mentioned are far from mild. They were, in fact, easily picked up and commented on by my wife, who is supremely uninterested in tweaky, geeky stuff, and who would presumably be happy with an old Kodak Brownie if it took halfway decent pictures.I still give the 5400 two stars because the macro pictures it takes are nothing short of astounding (if you can forget about the patently incorrect colors for a moment). A picture of the engraving inside a ring brought out awesome detail, even specks of dust and scratches that were hard to pick up with the naked eye. A photo of a piece of transparent sticky tape I'd pulled off an envelope showed paper fibers in such detail, it seemed that by zooming in just one step further, actual atoms would appear in the image...Still, all told, I'm sorely disappointed, and so this camera is going back to Amazon for a refund. Guess I'll be trying out the twice-as-expensive Nikon D-70 next, hopefully with much better results.","Date":"April 9, 2004"}

{"Title":"Crash & Burn - Caveat Emptor","Author":"J. Hooper \"Hoopla\"","ReviewID":"RUD8J3XLLY36U","Overall":"bad","Content":"Apparently the CCD and batteries used by Nikon on many of their Digital Cameras are manufactured by Sony. The Nikon 5700 is under a Nikon \"voluntary recall\". Kind of like \"don't ask, don't tell\". The 5400 has the same issues but repairs / replacements are much less \"voluntary\" in nature. Lots of bad press about it on the web and two-thirds to four-fifths of the cameras selling on eBay are sold in \"As is Condition & Final\" or \"For Parts\" with no returns allowed. This camera has some great features but can be frustrating to get it to act right in a timely manner. Mine has crashed and burned very recently too. Just turned it on and it was fried, less than 3000 pictures taken. It was not cheap to buy and I also bought many accessories that only work on the 5400 and if I cannot get it fixed I am out even more.","Date":"January 22, 2007"}

I was very excited when it arrived. After using it for a while, though, I realized what a mistake I'd made.  Number one problem: focus.  The camera has no auto-focus assist lamp, and does a TERRIBLE job of focusing in indoor light situations.  Nikon would have us believe that the flash is normally required for those times, but my 4-year-old Canon Powershot S10 handles similar situations perfectly.  In fact, the Powershot S10 outperforms the 5400 in a lot of ways.  Compounding the problem of the 5400's inept autofocusing is the small, grainy LCD.  So even if it looks like your picture's in focus, chances are when you see them full-size you'll realize they weren't.  Too bad I took too long trying to figure out whether all these problems were user-error, or I'd have returned the camera to Amazon.  Now I'm stuck with it.","Date":"March 18, 2004"}

I rarely used this camera because it's so SLOW and inconvenient to use.  Also, one of the times I actually did use it, it fell off my coffee table and onto the carpeted floor and jammed the zoom and totally quit working.  I couldn't believe that it was so fragile!  I sent it off for Nikon to fix and it cost over 200 dollars to fix!  Yet another shocker! It takes nice pictures most of the time, but as others have mentioned, often they turn out hazey in certain lighting.  I'm just disgusted that so much money has been invested in a camera that I've never enjoyed using.  The one I just purched cost 1/4 of the amount that has been spent on this nikon.

This is a big plus for newbees but if you're paying top dollar you'll be in A or S mode anyway. If you use the LCD for composing it's a bit small. Good things are the 28mm wide end (but the Nikon 5000 had that).The extra telephoto end is a little longer compared to the 5000 but comes at a price (smaller f stop).

Unfortunately, my G5 arrived today with a dead pixel on the LCD. Dead pixels are a fairly common problem to digicams, so it wasn't a huge deal. Because of this, I knew I would be exchanging the G5 immediately but decided to take a few test photos first. Photos from the G5 had more of a grainy appearance and the purple fringing was way out of hand. I read this in reviews of the camera on dpreview.com and other places, but thought that the G5 still had to be an upgrade to the G5.It's simply not the case. Although the camera felt nicer in my hands and physically looks better (I'm partial to the black exterior) it was simply not worth the extra cash. I think most new users would be better off spending less on one of the earlier G series models than spending top dollar on a camera that doesn't live up to its expectations.I am so disappointed that I have no choice but to return my G5 to Amazon.","Date":"July 15, 2003"}

Hall","ReviewID":"RMBE71JF09BRN","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera does a little of everything, video with sound as well as images. The pictures it takes can be fantastic. Unfortunately the subject has to be pretty still or in very good lighting to get a good shot. I took this camera to a soccer practice of a bunch of 10-year-olds in the daytime with heavy cloud cover and not a single photograph turned out. That included the few I used the built-in flash on (it couldn't focus). I also tried shooting some pictures at an indoor game that were disastrous because of the quick subjects (10-year-olds again) and low lighting.Even during several outdoor games in bright sunlight it just couldn't hack it. I took several hundred photographs to get 30 or 40 worth keeping. Most of the time I was struggling with the camera trying to get it to focus and snap before the children ran away and out of focus.I also took this camera to Hawaii for a vacation. It did much better when the subject stood still and smiled, but none of the evening sunset-shots turned out.The camera also has a flaw in that the lens blocks out part of the viewfinder. This isn't much of an issue once you get used to using the LED to line up your shots.On the plus side, this camera has a very long battery life and can use the Ultra II compact flash cards. The software was also very easy to use (be sure to read the instructions BEFORE loading it onto your computer, not during).Overall, my recommendation is to spend a little extra for an SLR camera and leave this one alone.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}

You can't even see the name of the picture file unless go to properties and then parse it out of an unfriendly name.  The software was made to lock you into using ofoto to share/print your pictures.

It is not user friendly at all, I lose my pictures, they don't show up in their folders when I go to retrieve them and every photo I download has to go in this software. It prints nice pictures after you finally get them ready. All mine have red eye, so the dock was a waste of $200 as it only gave me about 3 photos and is basically an expensive recharger which takes up space. I also want to use it for auction photos but cannot get good close ups or find my photos later and dislike waiting while each picture downloads again everytime I take a new picture. I have to sit and wait about 5 minutes or more to even get to my new pic for my auction as  have yet to edit every pic. Most end up with red eye and need retouching. They also do not always turn out as I take them. Sometimes the flash is delayed and I don't get the shot i want. i have set the red eye and flash but it does not work properly. I cannot beleive i spent $600 on this piece of junk. If I want to go to the drugstore and print out a picture, the color is good but then what is the point. I want to have a good pic to begin with and/or be able to use the software to edit it and email or put it in an auction. They look terrible in my auctions as closeups are difficult even using the closeup viewer. The auto is better. I still have not figured out the software and wish I had the money to trash this camera and get another one or at least use another software with it.  It does not go into another program but Kodak pictures and you can not find them by date when emailing or browsing. They are not in their folders or by date, they are random and I do not know which is my editd pic and which is the original b/c if i get rid of the original, it erases all of them. You have to save your edited pic in a folder or it is not actually there either.  Anyone know of a better camera with good editing software. Maybe I can sell this one and get something else. The dock holds the charge all day for me so I don't even need any extra batteries but that was not worth $200 plus warranty.","Date":"November 2, 2004"}

{"Title":"Tim Robertson MyMac.com Review","Author":"Tim E Robertson \"Publisher MyMac\"","ReviewID":"R3AJKGDEARTITA","Overall":"bad","Content":"I love doing product reviews. I like to think, while writing one, that I am actually talking to someone, telling them about the product in question. And as a reviewer, there are some companies whose products I love to review. Hewlett-Packard (HP) is one such company. I have had a long and happy relationship with every HP product I have used and reviewed over the last decade. So it saddens me when, after testing the HP Photosmart 435 digital camera, it came time to write this review.The Photosmart 435 is a 3.34MP digital camera that you can also use to take small Quick-Time movies with. While not a large camera, the Photosmart 435 is by no means tiny. It fits easily in a purse, but not in the pocket of your pants. (Unless you are wearing cargo pants.)The camera is not stylish, but rather plain and boxy. This works for me, as I don't always want to call attention to my camera. It does not look expensive, and at $149 (US) it is not. If anything, the design reminds me of a 110 Film camera I owned in my teenage years. It has that feel in my hands, very familiar.Operation is simple. Slide the lens cover, which doubles as the on/off switch, and take a picture. There are a variety of options, from picture quality, shutter speed, flash, red-eye flash, zoom, and most of the other features every digital camera sports. So far so good.The Photosmart 435 has 3.34MP resolution at its highest quality setting. As I already own a 3.1MP camera (The Kodak DX3900) I had an idea what to expect in image quality. In fact, I was expecting somewhat better looking photos with the Photosmart 435, being a higher resolution camera. I was sorely mistaken. The image quality, most times, is decent to good. However, the quality of the pictures is not at all consistent. I found that out of ten pictures taken indoors under normal lighting conditions, eight of the ten photos would be of decent quality, while the other two would be very poor. I don't know why the image quality is so unpredictable with this camera, but after extensive testing, I would personally not use this camera.Also like most digital cameras, the Photosmart 435 has an image display viewfinder. The 1.5-inch LCD is used to set options, review pictures or movies, and can be used instead of the optical viewfinder. For those who hate looking through the tiny optical viewfinder when taking pictures, the image display viewfinder is a much better choice.The problem here is the quality of the Photosmart 435's 1.5-inch LCD display. It is far and away the worse I have ever used. In live mode, the display is a green and blurry mess, all but unusable. In picture review mode, it is somewhat better, but still far and away sub-par to any other digital camera I have used in the past.One of the biggest disadvantages is the zoom. There is no optical zoom on the Photosmart 435, but rather digital. A digital zoom is always sub-par than a optical zoom, and that is true here as well. The 5X Digital zoom works as advertised, but any picture zoomed became pixilated and not at all sharp. After playing with the various settings, I found that if I had to zoom up on an object with the Photosmart 435, it simply was not worth taking the picture.Taking photos of objects in motion, even a slow walking cat, really showed the Photosmart 435's shortfall. After taking pictures of a cat in both normal and action shutter speed mode, the pictures were blurry and unusable.The big test, however, came when I gave the camera to our eight-year-old daughter, Brittaney, and told her to take pictures around the yard of anything she wanted to. The conditions were very cold, around thirty degrees and frosty, but the sun was very bright and the fall colors look beautiful. Brittaney took a total of 17 pictures. One of the first problems I noticed was that every other picture had a nice close-up of a finger. Because the lens on the Photosmart 435 is receded, it is very easy to block the lens with your hand while taking a picture. Camera's that have a lens housing that sticks out some, extends from the camera body itself, usually prevents this. The pictures she took, about ten, that was unobstructed by a finger, came out blurry or the camera had too much light. Different setting made no difference.The Photosmart 435 does come with 16MB of internal memory, so you will not have to run out and buy extra storage. However, today, 16MB will quickly prove too small. It is nice, though, that the 16MB is internal, not a card that you will toss out when you upgrade to a 256MB memory card. This is great if, by chance, you fill your memory card up and still need to take a few pictures. I wish more digital camera's would have internal, built-in memory. Unfortunately, you can use one storage device at a time. If you have a memory card installed, the internal storage will not work. The Photosmart 435 takes the smaller SD / MMC Memory cards, not Compact Flash.The Photosmart 435 ships with its own software solution, HP Director, which you can use to store and transfer pictures. While the software does work fine, I preferred using iPhoto. The Photosmart 435 works perfectly well with iPhoto, as expected. But if you use the Photosmart 435 to take video with, you will need to use the HP Director software to capture that file from the camera, as iPhoto will not work. Also, the HP software does not find the Photosmart 435 when running Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) but does under 10.2. If you do buy this camera, look for an update to their software if you are running 10.3. As I type of this review, there is no update for the HP software. In fact, I have not seen anything on the HP website that indicated you can download updates. The only option I have found is to order a CD-ROM.The video capture feature is more gimmick than anything. The clips are small, grainy, and not worth using to record your important memories with. But it is fun! My kids liked the ability to capture video and audio using the Photosmart 435. I have less worry letting them practice being the next Spielberg with this camera than I do turning over my Canon Camcorder to them. All the video recorded can be used in iMovie, so this is a neat and fun way to let kids learn the basics of shooting video and editing in iMovie.Unfortunately, the Photosmart 435 is a sub-par digital camera. The price, at US $149, makes it inexpensive. Simply reading the specifications in its documentation would sounds like a great deal: 3.34MP, internal 16MB of memory, able to capture video and audio, a 1.5-inch LCD, the ability to use an optional dock, and an optional AC adapter, and more. The reality is that the Photosmart 435 has horrible power consumption (I used three sets of batteries in one week of testing, a total of around 100 pictures!) sub-par picture quality, and a near-useless LCD display.I am disappointed with the Photosmart 435. I expect much better from HP. I am hoping that the next HP camera we review will better meet my expectations of quality HP products. The Photosmart 435 does not feel or operate at the expected quality of an HP product.MyMac Rating: 2 out of 5Tim Robertson","Date":"November 29, 2003"}
{"Title":"Something's Missing?","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2EJTTFP59K2PK","Overall":"bad","Content":"Advantages:Price- For the price, I guess that this could be considered a decent camera. But this camera is definitely a case of getting what you pay for.Size- This camera easily fits into a purse or a coat pocket, which is typically important to the point and shoot consumer.Disadvantages:Photo clarity-it seems that HPs target market is the beginning digital user, however, I am guessing that they also assumed that for the price, this beginning user 1. should not expect much and 2. would not know enough about digital technology to know the difference. The quality of the photos that this camera produces is not nearly as good as the 2.1 megapixel camera that my parents use for taking photos of the grandkids.Zoom: again, given the price, I have to qualify with the fact that one shouldn't exactly expect a state of the art experience. However, HP should have just left the zoom feature out altogether. You may be able to get a relatively decent photo at 1X (even relative to the subpar quality of the photos with no zoom) anything higher than that and you will have to pull out grandma's bifocals to get rid of the fuzz.HP Product Presentation - If HP had just come clean and called the camera what it really is, something for your pre-teen to use to take photos of kids with braces at the movies, then I would not have been as disappointed. The fact that this is advertised as a 3.3MP camera and a camera that will take great pictures could be considered false advertising.This one will definitely be heading back east to the 13 year old niece to use with her friends, where it belongs.","Date":"October 3, 2003"}
{"Title":"3 megapixel piece of junk","Author":"A. Farukhi \"nsp\"","ReviewID":"RVWS4P9E57CQW","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was suspicious of this camera when I read some initial reviews of it online. Now having tried it in person, it confirms all the bad things I've heard.The biggest disappointment was that a 3 megapixel camera could take such poor pictures. Consistency is the key here. This camera cannot take consistently good pictures. You have to constantly change the settings to get a half decent picture. If I wanted the hassle with the guess and check, I would have bought a [$$] digital camera. What this basically means is, wait until this camera drops to the sub [$$$] price range.The pictures always come out over exposed or underexposed, and they're usually grainy and blurry. It's a nightmare trying to figure out what settings will allow you to take good indoor pictures.With other cameras, especially the ones canon and fuji make, if you have lighting problems, you turn your flash off, hold the camera still and hope that the available light will make a good photo. With those cameras, it usually does. This camera has something wrong with the processor or software, and instead of taking the picture, it tries to compensate by delaying the exposure time to 2-4 seconds, which washes out the picture completely. I know it's inanimate, but I still call it stupid.Outdoors, however, this camera is fine. In fact, you should use this camera strictly outdoors and always with flash. It's a daytime camera and does well to have diffused lighting. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. If you somehow end up with this camera, use it outdoors.It is pretty small, but not small enough that I'd want to carry it around. Load time is not quick enough for a snapshot and quality will be bad 2 times out of three. If I want a camera to carry around, I'd get a disposable. It does have a video feature with sound, but the quality is worse than motion captures on similar products. It records in .mpg format, if that's a plus for you, well, good for you.Again, a disappointment if you pay more than [$$$] for this camera.","Date":"November 7, 2003"}

I also know that sliding lens covers protect the lens, but it turns on the camera.

It appears to have about 4 pixels and has got the lowest refresh rate I've ever seen.  It's quite hard to see what you're taking a picture of, and you must stabilize and sit still for a moment before you can use it at all.  The picture quality... Well I only have my own camera to compare it to.  The Elph SD100.. which has the same resolution as this camera.. so I expected the picture quality to be similar.  Not so!  The pictures just seem so lifeless compared to my other camera.  It also seems like it doesn't compensate for lighting as well.  Construction seems cheap.. it weighs about as much as a plastic disposable camera.  I can not believe I wasted about $230 on this junk.  I bought it before it was released thinking it was the latest and greatest from HP.  Little did I know.. this camera was intended to break price barriers... NOT performance barriers.  One thing I will say.  It is easy to use.  Very very simple design and interface.  (too simple.. no good toys for the serious picture taker)  If someone writes up a good review for this camera, it has to be that they've never used a quality digital camera before.  Period.  This thing is a dog!  If you're looking for a cheap camera for a VERY simple point & click type person who doesn't mind buying stock in Duracell.. and none too computer savey.. this camera will do.

{"Title":"Nice camera but has some flaws","Author":"S. Tweedie","ReviewID":"R31NWFF7EDGPB6","Overall":"bad","Content":"If all you want to do is take some quick snapshots, then this camera is sufficient.  If you have it set to take the \"best\" quality pictures, even though you get fewer, the quality is satisfactory.  \"Better\" quality pictures are also decent and gives you several more pictures per SD card than \"best.\"  The digital zoom is rather lacking, however.  I don't use it that often as I've found the pictures are usually blurry and grainy.  Same with the screen on the back.  When the screen is activated, the image is green and very blurry and sluggish.  I rather look through the little hole view finder than look at a sluggish screen.  Plus, the screen is a major drain on batteries.As for the video,...the quality is very lacking.  All the video I have taken has been grainy, blurry, and the sound quality is very poor.  You more often hear yourself breathing than whatever noise your subject is making and if you speak...your voice is distorted and much louder than your subject.I've attempted to use the camera during low light situations and I found that it didn't function that well.  Concert pictures were often blurred even if I stayed really still.  Shots of the moon didn't even come out, even with the zoom all the way out.I now have a 1 year old son who is constantly on the move and that makes it a little harder to have pictures that are not blurry.  The \"action\" setting does seem to help, but not that much.  Forget using the screen on the back...he's out of frame faster than lightning.Also, I've found that rechargable batteries are best and last much longer than standard alkaline batteries.  One complaint I have is that the sliding bar over the lens can be easily opened and can quickly drain your batteries leaving you without a camera.On a good note, it is very easy to upload your pictures to the computer through a USB cable (which it comes with).  You aren't required to have a photo printer or a dock.For a free camera (I won it in a contest), I have to say that it has served its purpose of taking pictures.  I have been happy with the camera, but now that I have a 1 year old, I want something of higher quality.  I have taken well over 2000 pictures on it since receiving it in April 2004.  I recommend purchasing a higher quality camera even if you only want simple pictures.","Date":"March 16, 2006"}

Actually, it is quite a disappointment since I purchased this camera on the day my nephew was born so I could get some shots.  Had I researched it more, I probably wouldn't have wasted my money.Fortunately, I dropped the camera, broke the housing unit and now I get to buy another, better camera!","Date":"July 12, 2005"}

It was impossible to get a clear shot of anything. A lot of pictures taken in loer than normal light had a lot of noise. Overall, this camera is very poor quality for the price. I couldn't believe that it didn't have a macro mode. I found that the Fuji FinePix A205 was a MUCH better camera when it came to the price.","Date":"February 20, 2005"}

The pictures were good and the camera looks beautiful, but it guzzled batteries like there's no tomorrow. I used NiMH rechargables, but within 5 shots, the battery level indicator was at its lowest, and with 8 shots, it had died out! Of course, the software was another issue. It installed all kinds of icons on my desktop. I hate a cluttered desktop, so when I removed the icons, many features of the program just went dead! I returned and got myself a Kodak.","Date":"July 25, 2004"}
{"Title":"buy a 1.3 MP instead","Author":"I used to like HP","ReviewID":"R1VTXKC7VBL3L5","Overall":"bad","Content":"In short, I vote this as the worst product of 2004. Can I give zero or negative stars? I give it negative 5This thing is made by Energizer and Duracell to sell batteries! I take pictures with LCD off to conserve power. With my 2100 mAh NiMH, I took 30 pictures before I had to recharge them. With alkalines, I took 12 pictures before I had to replace the batteries. This is with flash and LCD off, lowest power setting. For comparison, same NiMH lasts over 200 pictures.  (...)The movie and zoom do not work. Since they must have the LCD on, and LCD eats batteries even faster, you have maybe 20 seconds before you have to replace the batteries! I bought 256MB SD and thought I could make some movies, but the most I got was about 15 MB movie before the battery ran out. I don't know why they put SD slot since one cannot fill 16 MB internal memory before one has to replace the batteries. I think they did this on purpose since the movie quality would make the enemies of whoever is in the movie. Yes, it is that bad; my 20 dollar webcam makes way way way better movies.I could not even change the ISO settings after first 5 shots with NiMH since LCD must be on to change the settings. ISO is always on auto when you power up; it forgets the setting each time it's powered down. And one must always change the ISO since auto ISO makes unbelievably bad picture.  (...)At 3 MP setting, pictures are just awful. Colors are not even, and it looks like it was interpolated from 640x480. At 640x480, pictures look about average, slightly worse than my 8 year old digital camera. HP's colors are noticeably noisier, even against a heavily used 8 year old camera.For the problems and features, this camera is not worth the price. If this costs LESS THAN typical webcam, and if it's bundled with AC adapter, it might be worth it. Otherwise, save your money and time. I'm much happier with my 1.3 MP.","Date":"April 10, 2004"}

{"Title":"Pretty shabby","Author":"Jaclyn","ReviewID":"R1742100R5FOSD","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera is alright if it's your first one since it's so easy to use but, after a while you notice what a waste of money it is. Like some other people, I got this camera for Christmas and thought it was great! So, after a month when I dropped it and it shattered, I bought the same one. Bad idea. Sometimes the pictures just show up as static or with a green or blueish tone. The flash barely works and it really does eat up the batteries. I never ever used the LCD screen because the batteries would die in about 2 minutes. Also, you can't access the main menu without the LCD and the LCD doesn't work when the batteries are low. I would still use this camera because I really would rather not spend money on a 3rd one in 2 years however, the USB cable broke and I haven't been able to find one I can buy seperately.Tip: For young kids, it's an alright buy because they probably won't know the difference.

{"Title":"HP should be ashamed","Author":"Nick \"Nick Mazzaglia\"","ReviewID":"R2GAT0L6D1PY5X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I got this little nice camera for a very low price. I was supposed to be happy and eager to used but there is only one word to describe this product: Dissapointment. I started using it and I noticed that you can only get good pictures when you're outside and there's bright sunlight. When you take pictures inside the quality is just awful, and the flash it's not the best in the market. Don't use the Zoom! or your quality will drop to not even 1MP. I don't know really how can this camera be 3.1 MP, it doesn't even get close to that. I have a 1.3 MP Olympus and the picture quality can't be compared. So I would recommend this camera to those only living in desert areas where there's always sunshine and to people who do not take pictures inside, if you match this criteria you'll have a good camera for low price, but if not don't even think about it.","Date":"March 10, 2004"}

I could have got the 635 for the same price, but thought that a 3Megapixel camera w/5times digital zoom must be better than a 2Megapixel with a 3times optical.Less than a week after I bought it I returned it to 'upgrade' to the lesser HP 635.3x optical, 4x digital with more features. Odd. I take better photos with less 'megapixel' than with the higher. Oh well. Live and learn.Batteries are gone in like 20minutes, the screen is slow and choppy, indoor photos are a waste of time.Spend the same money and get the HP 635. You'll be happier.

{"Title":"HP PhotoSmart 435 sucks","Author":"Charlie Q \"CQ\"","ReviewID":"RA0L8KQ85BA9L","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera takes really lousy pictures - one can see granulations even at the highest quality setting when taking any sort of pictures indoors with the flash turned off. The pictures were often outof focus even in strong light. Things are better with the flash turned on but only for closeup shots. Still the colors leave much to be desired. Do not buy this camera if you want to take any pictures indoors. It also ate up the battery that came with it very quickly.Featurewise it looks good - but picture quality sucks royally.This is at best a 1MP camera masquerading as a 3.3MP one ; I agree with the reviewer who said that HP stands accused of deceptive advertising.

I'ts all true- terrible white-scale aberations in low light, fixed focus and it looks like it.  One set of batteries (2xAA) exceeds the worth of the camera, and will only take a few pictures for them to be exausted.  I was the unlucky recipient of one as a gift, I'm giving it to my Beagle as a chew toy.By comparison, I picked up a Vivitar 3610 on a blister-pack for twenty dollars (software, cables, NTSC and Pal movie output [with cable]) and, whilst it's 2MP as oposed to the HP's 3.2MP, it takes remarkable pictures, the Vivitar has it all over the HP.

It kind of disappointed me, but I thought maybe it was normal and I continued using it for awhile. The pictures seemed fine on the camera and on the computer, but when I got them developed they came out awful. A lot of them were dark and blurry, only a few came out good.

{"Title":"HP 433/435 good outside and durable. Bad inside with flash.","Author":"Ave Joe \"Ave Joe\"","ReviewID":"RUX3QC5SVR5J","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought the HP 433, 128MB memory card, and rechargeable batteries for my 11 year old daughter to take on a trip over the holidays; she openned it early and we returned the HP 433 the next day. Outside, the camera works well in daylight and the pictures are sharp. Inside with flash, the color intensity is poor with a light blue tint - skip the movie mode inside, it's very very poor. The battery life seems the same as other cameras; I took 50+ picutes at the highest quality all inside with flash with one set of 1800 mA batteries before I got tired of taking pictures and stopped taking pictures. HP deserves praise for the durability of this product; my daughter slammed the camera on a wood floor when she lost her balance taking a picture and she fell backwards. The battery cover came off; when I put it back on the camera, the HP 433 functioned like a champ - no harm done and I stongly considered keeping the camera because of its durability. I like the fixed focal length for my daughter; fewer moving parts and every shoot appeared in focus and no blur for moving objects. The display on the back of the camera is very poor compared to a Kodak CX6200 and my old Kodak DC5000. We returned the camera, bought a Kodak CX6200, and were are please with the purchase of the Kodak CX6200. The HP 433/435 is easy to use and the perfect size for \"on the go mode.\" I will conside a HP camera similar to the HP 433/435, if HP fixes the picture quality of inside shots with flash, improves/fixes the inside movies (currenty not worth using inside - outside movies works well and good sound quality), and improves the LCD display on the back of the camera. If HP can fix the above problems, this HP will have a home run on their hands - instead of the current strike out; also, weather resistant with infrared remote would be nice and I'd pay a little more for this.","Date":"December 24, 2003"}

I've been much much better quality images from a 1 MP camera. The zoom pixelation is awful, the only clear pictures came when zoom wasn't used.LCD viewfinder shows everything in yellow and moves in slow motion, so you really don't have an idea of exactly what you are taking a picture of.Battery life of this camera is at best 30 mins. Within 5 mins, I was not able to use the LCD viewfinder and could only view the optical view due to lack of battery, then about 10 after that, the battery was completely drained.The only positive to this camera is that the software is easy to use PERIOD.This was going to be a gift for a child who is 14 yrs old.
