He would have preferred a >$2000 gaming rig but given he's in the military, I didn't want to give anyone else itchy fingers, not to mention being in less than optimal conditions. He was doubtful when he received it but came around quickly once he found that it handled WoW easily. In fact, a friend \"triple boxed\" Wow (running three game concurrently) without any trouble! The keypad layout is much better than the configuration of our 17\" and the boot-up time is short and sweet thanks to ASUS for keeping it clean and virtually free of bloatware (yes, I'm looking at you, HP!) All in all, we're very happy with the capabilities and price of this laptop and will be looking to ASUS for our future needs.","Date":"December 31, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dell XPS Meet Your Match","Author":"Justin M. Perry","ReviewID":"R2HD5CTCZIC4DF","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a Dell XPS M1530 November 2008 and it was subsequently stolen November of 2009. In my quest to replace my laptop I was stubborn & hesitant at first to stray from Dell having owned 3 laptops previously from them with no issues and nothing but excellent experience. I went shopping at a local Electronics retailer and stumbled upon this machine which is lesser known in the Southern US, however I have now learned they are the 3rd largest seller of laptop computers in the world and have won numerous awards. This machine is FAST it boots up to start menu in a mere 8 seconds flat which is impressive. Although there are faster machines out there, for the price of this one it is well worth it for under $1000. The screen picture is crisp as no other and is LED HD and has one of the best resolutions out there, great for movies and other video media. The internal sound card combined with alltec lansing speakers provide for an excellent sound also for music, etc. ALthough not as fancy to the eye or as gimicky as a Dell XPS this is as compatible as it gets and at a better price. also interesting is the 1yr warranty that protects you even from accidental dropping of the machine. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, etc.","Date":"December 15, 2009"}

{"Title":"Annoying Screen Flickering Problem","Author":"DealsGuy","ReviewID":"R3YHSA090AEEQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"It started out as a great laptop. After few months, I started to notice the screen behaving weird. It will flicker randomly when I resume it from sleep. Then I sent it for fixing to Asus service center. They sent it back without fixing anything saying they cant reproduce the problem without even contacting me. Now I have to figure out a way how to reproduce it for them to fix, which is very hard as the screen flicker on randomly. I did lot of research online too about the problem. Just google 'asus k61ic' and google will pop up with 'asus k61ic screen flickering' as one of the most searched terms. So I guess many people are having problem with this laptop model. I had high hopes on Asus service and expected Asus to know by now about this problem and also have a permanent fix for it. I have RMA'd my laptop 2nd time and sent it. I am waiting to see if they can fix it or not.Lesson Learned: No matter which brand you buy, reliability can vary widely depending on the model of the laptop - now i think, buying good car is lot easier than buying a good laptop.EDIT: ASUS was able to fix the problem and it is working fine after that. I think they replaced my LCD panel. I agree with the other comment - the dvd drive is finicky and springs out at unexpected moments - funny it doesnt get closed so easily too sometimes - its weird.. anyways, apart from that, the splendid utility wont work right, if you login as standard user - it needs administrative rights - another weird thing. Apart from those few annoyances, if you are persistent with ASUS, I guess they will fix your hardware problems. But its not fun to go thru the ordeal.","Date":"December 5, 2010"}

Had to replace Win7 with Linux, as it gets very slow as you load it with stuff.Pretty decent for common tasks and quite good for gaming, but perhaps not for the latest FPS on max settings. Also works pretty fast with photoshop, although windows does consume a huge amounts of memory.Laptop does stay pretty cool and after 2 months still works very quietly (my last Acer had a scratching and wiggling fan by that time). Battery lasts about an hour and a half on video playback (I guess could be longer if the power saving options are configured properly).The only thing I did not quite like -- the glossy finish of the laptop cover, however, to be fair, it does not show fingerprints as badly and does look pretty cool when clean (for about 15 minutes that is :). Another little annoyance -- plastic around the display is pretty soft and can easily accumulates minor scratches.Another thing I did not expect -- the 16\" display has a 1366x768 resolution, which means that it is more stretched than more \"standard\" 15.4\". Some games playable in full screen on 15.4\" now run in a small square in the center of the screen -- which is not a huge deal especially if you have external display -- but at the same time its great for watching movies.","Date":"February 3, 2010"}

{"Title":"One of the best under $700 notebooks","Author":"Jeff Carroll","ReviewID":"R10326OSJ0RU2J","Overall":"good","Content":"Just received my Asus UL30A-X5 yesterday. After much review, and a try-out with an Acer 1410, I decided that I wanted a full-sized chiclet/island keyboard and the larger screen. I'm already quite pleased with my decision. At the <$700 price point, this is an excellent notebook.Pros- Keyboard. A pleasure to type on.- Touchpad. It drags at first, but once you get some finger oil on it, and change the pointer speed, it's one of the best that I've used. Very smooth two finger scroller. Support for customized two and three finger click.- Screen. Bright and easy to read at 30 degree angles.- Battery life. Yes, it will do over 10 hours.- Weight/size. 1 inch thin and very light.- Body. Love the brushed black metal look on the case.- Asus facial recognition login. Didn't think that I would care, but it's nice to have the computer log in, without touch, when I'm sitting in front of it.- Asus FastBoot (not the BIOS fast boot). This lets you configure which programs load during startup and which load after. Speeds up the boot quite a bit.- Decent speakers. Not ear-destroying, but suitable for the size. Much better than most netbooks.Cons- Placement of touchpad. It still registers my palm as I'm typing even at the extreme setting. Downloaded the new touchpad driver, but that didn't fix.  Still looking for a solution. This is by far the most frustrating problem. UPDATE: The TouchFreeze utility seems to almost fix the issue.- Case still shows fingerprints.- Web cam is low res and has difficulty in low light (haven't tried different drivers yet).","Date":"October 24, 2009"}
{"Title":"Excellent Ultra-Portable Laptop at a Great Price!","Author":"TJ","ReviewID":"R3Q382L1L7Q7DB","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently purchased the Asus UL30A-X5 through Amazon and am very pleased with my decision.  Let me first begin by briefly explaining what I was looking for in a new laptop, as I believe that will give the reader better information when deciding if this laptop is right for them.  I am currently a student on a budget and was looking for the following: 1) Less than $700 in price, 2) Screen size between 13-14\", 3) Windows 7 already installed (I didn't want an older computer with Vista that I would have to manually upgrade to Win 7 myself), 4) At least 320GB HD, 3 GB DDR3 RAM, and a Pentium Core 2 Duo SU7300 equivalent or greater processor, 5) Thin and light, and 6) 4+ solid hours of battery life.  Although a netbook offers a small size and easy portability, I didn't want to sacrifice power and performance for everyday tasks.  On the other hand, I also didn't want a large \"desktop replacement\" laptop that would be a hassle to carry around or difficult to take with me anytime I was away from home.  In summary, I wanted a laptop that offered a good combination of power, performance, and size for my money.  With that being said, here is my impression thus far after 2 days of using this computer:Pros:-Performance: Able to smoothly and efficiently handle everything I have wanted to do to this point.  It is even faster than my 3 year old 15.6\" Dell Inspiron that I originally paid $1300 for at the time.-Size and Weight: Couldn't be happier with the sleek look and light weight. It looks even better in person than in the pictures.-Quality: Some people may think you are sacrificing quality for a laptop with these specs for under $700.  I think this computer is built very well, and would argue it stands up to the much more expensive or name-brand models in the same class.-Warranty: The accidental protection warranty offers an extra piece of mind, which is also something not often included without an additional cost in other laptops.-Keyboard:  Very easy to use, great design!-Mousepad: I love the textured touchpad on this model.  It is difficult to see in the pictures, but the touchpad is actually not a traditional \"pad\", but a bunch of tiny dots that track the movement of your finger.  Also, I really like the extra features such as being able to scroll up or down a page by using two fingers anywhere on the pad.Cons:-The only thing that I am not too excited about is the small (or \"smaller\" when compared to my larger laptop) mouse buttons below the touchpad.  This might be something that just takes a little getting used to, but it is more difficult to click the buttons than on my older laptop.  Again, this is my first 13.3\" laptop so it probably just comes with the nature of a smaller laptop and I will get used to it with time, but it's just something I wanted to point out if you are transitioning from a large laptop to a smaller one.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Sure, there are better laptops on the market as some will argue, but only if you are willing to spend $1000+.  This computer definitely earns \"5 stars\" and I think anyone who is looking for an affordable, ultra-portable laptop with powerful performance will be very happy as well.","Date":"October 27, 2009"}

I really like the finish, it's very thin, less than 1 inch, but by no means is thinner than the macbook air. The casing is very sexy, it looks very nice from all angles. The keyboard is amazing, the only problem is that it has a little flex but its not the end of the world I can type pretty well. The most annoying thing might be the touchpad, whenever you type and you have your hands positioned close to it, the touchpad might register some click while you type. A lot of people are talking about the battery life of this computer that it won't even reach 10 hours, I can confirm I get 11+ hours on this lappie, Windows 7 is much more energy efficient than Vista (note: I tested under wireless off, lowest screen brightness, power saving mode, word 2007).  I really enjoy the price point its less than $700, which is the perfect price for the performance.PROS: - Stylish, very sexy looking. - Keyboard feels amazing. - Multi-touch track pad works well - Fast compared to a netbook (C2D, 4GB DDR3) - Battery life 11+ hours - Smart Logon, very nice cool feature - Big hard drive 500GB - LED screen has nice viewing angles - Very light and portable - The charger is very small and portable too. - Loud quality speakers from small size - Warranty, 1 Year of accidental Damage - Price its a deal!CONS: - Fingerprint magnet (inside and outside) - Loud Hard drive (a little annoying) - Little flex on the keyboard - ASUS bloatware - Intel GMA4500MHD, where's the UL30A-VT? can't do gaming - It doesn't cook, do laundry, or cleans my room.This computer is perfect for students, and travelers.

{"Title":"Display too glossy","Author":"M. Floyd","ReviewID":"R277820YF09ZJE","Overall":"good","Content":"Update 11/14: I've decided that I'm going to return this laptop.  The glossy display is too reflective.  It's not really that noticeable if you are looking at a web page with a white background with the brightness turned all the way up, but in almost every case it's just too glossy for my tastes.  Also, as mentioned blow, this display fails horribly for sharing the screen for something such as watching a movie.  If they swapped out the display and trackpad, this would be the perfect budget laptop.---I was torn between this product and the Acer Aspire Timeline.  I ultimately decided to go with this product because of the battery life claim.  Obviously the battery life claim on ANY laptop is quoted using settings that will not be reflective of the typical user.One of my biggest concerns with this laptop was the processor.  I was not sure if it would be able to handle my daily computing activities.  This machine is by no means a powerhouse, but it is more than capable.  As long as you do not need to do anything such as gaming or multimedia editing, you should be fine with this laptop.  This machine is capable of playing HD videos with a little extra left over for background tasks.Notes:- While you do receive recovery DVDs, if you need to take advantage of them you will need to get an external DVD drive.  I have heard some reports that some external DVD drives do not receive enough power through one USB port and require either a powered USB hub or plugging the drive into two USB ports.  (This is why USB cables for portable HDD and portable disc drives have two heads.)  I am pleased to say that the Samsung USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive for Mac and PC SE-S084C/RSBN (Gloss Black) works perfectly with just one USB plug.- The power brick can get hot.  One review claimed it got as hot as 130 F.  I have not personally experienced temperatures this extreme.Usage: Microsoft Office, Web Browsing, Media PlayerPros:- Great balance between speed and battery life.- The keyboard is fantastic.- Very lightweight and portable.- The laptop does not get so warm that it is uncomfortable in your lap.- The laptop has a very sleek look.- Excellent value for the price.  Even on top of the specs, they throw in one year of accidental damage protection.  That's an incredible value.- The fans are very quiet even when they are on.- Comes with little bloatware.- Ability to play HD movies with no tweaking whatsoever (using VLC).  Keep in mind that Adobe Flash will soon be releasing an update that will push HD decoding off to the GPU.  If the new 1080p at YouTube is choppy for you now, just wait for the new version to come out.Cons:- The screen is very glossy and reflective.- I've really discovered that the viewing angles aren't all that great if you want more than one person to look at your screen at one time for something such as watching a movie together.- The track-pad is less than ideal.  The track-pad tends to move the cursor position while you are typing.  The gestures are nice, but I found that the scrolling doesn't register.  The trackpad utility is greatly lacking in features.- The hard disk squeaks.  It's not terribly loud, but you will notice if you have no other background noise.- The chassis is indeed a fingerprint magnet.  Again, this seems to be an issue with every make and every model laptop these days.- No back-lit keyboard.  This is not necessarily a bad thing since a back-lit keyboard would drain on the battery.","Date":"November 11, 2009"}

It's a beautiful piece of hardware, runs very quick, multitasks great, is dead silent, and I'm getting 10-12 hours of battery life on stock configuration.I've never seen anything like this; you just keep using it and using it and using it. Even when I've got every MS Office program running at once + a bunch of Firefox tabs + iTunes playing music, I still get 6-7 hours.I was pleasantly surprised how little bloatware came with it. The only annoying piece of software I really needed to uninstall was some antivirus program. MS Office Home/Student came preinstalled on a free trial, but I was going to use that anyway so they saved me the installation.Windows 7 runs great on this laptop. Power management and networking features work beautifully. The great sleep/wake functionality in Windows 7 makes startup time largely irrelevant, but even when you do have to start up from scratch it's nice and speedy. There are lots of nice little touches to this machine that let you know Asus is a really class act. Things like attractive on-screen displays for volume and brightness adjustment for example.My only nitpick is that the trackpad is a little jumpy. It's a little hard to land the cursor onto some of the smaller buttons, like scrollbar arrows. This is probably a driver issue, so it likely will be fixed soon enough. The keyboard is very spacious and pleasant to type on.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my UL30A-X5.","Date":"November 4, 2009"}

{"Title":"Amazing Asus ul30a.  Best Lap Top I've owned","Author":"A. Toye \"310art\"","ReviewID":"R3HOT71XJARUMU","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been using laptops for close to 20 years.  This is actually the most powerful and the least expensive laptop I have owned.  The interesting thing that this machine has is the \"express gate\" boot up.  If you don't read the intro instructions you might miss that it has 2 \"on\" buttons. One on the right and one the left.  The left side on button boots up a linux based operating system in about 15 seconds.  It really basic and only offers a web browser, a music and photo program.  This fast boot is great for just checking your email or surfing the web.  Since it is linux based and separate from your windows 7 operating system, it's like a MAC, viruses or spyware has no effect.  What a concept.  Actually, in that web browser, other than saving passwords and bookmarks, it does not let you saving anything or download anything to the harddrive.  You can save it to a memory stick if you want to save attachments or a download.I have also partitioned the 500 gig harddrive to set up a third operating system for my linux ubuntu.  But that is another story.  The windows 7 operating system works great and very stable.The major things I like about the ul30a are:  1. Prefect size of keyboard.  2. Great screen  3. Super fast  4. Super large harddrive  5. My estimate of battery life is around 6-7 hours.  I have never run it down to zero. But I don't think i will get the 10 to 12 hours Asus advertises.  One of the differences between the ul30a-x5 and the ul30a-x2 is the x5 has a 6 cell battery and the x2 has a 8 cell battery.  (also the x2 is silver and has a 2 year replacement warranty.  The x5 has a 1 year warranty)  6. Asus ExpressGate fastboot.  When you want to turn it off, you don't even have to go thur shutdown.  Just close the screen and next time you turn on the expressgate, it is a totally fresh startup,  ie it doesn't waste energy in hibernation or sleep. because it don't save anything.  7. I have not had any problems with the wifi reception.  It has in fact been very strong.  8. Great builtin speakers and great sound.Things I don't like about the ul30a:  1. When i am in expressgate or ubuntu, the cursor jumps around while i am typing.  I don't notice this in windows 7.  (is anyone else having this problem?)  2. It could be a little lighter.  (I wish i could have compared it to the ul20a.  The ul20a is lighter but a little smaller with only a 250 gig harddrive and 2 gigs ram instead of 4 gigs. Has anyone out there used the 20a and the 30a?)  3. The webcam shows an upside down picture of me in ubuntu.I did have a problem with my first UL30A.  The switch in the hindge the causes the laptop to go into sleep or hibernation mode was faulty and the laptop went into sleep mode when the screen was moved.  Amazon to their credit was very good and sent me a replacement within 5 days.  And this was just before Xmas.Update March 13, 2012It ran fine for 2 years.  Then one day it died.  I hit sleep and it never woke up.  I sent it to Asus.  They said i needed a new motherboard and LAN but I declined the repair because it was $460 for parts and $65 for labour.  They did not charge me for the service and returned the computer for free.  I think that it is just a loose connection on the motherboard because the laptop is now working fine as long i remove one of the 2 gig ram chips.  If anyone has any ideas that would be helpful.  I still love this computer but I reduced the rating by one star to 4 because of the problem.","Date":"January 3, 2010"}

I love everything about it! The screen is sharp and bright, the keyboard is well laid out and a pleasure to use, it's fast, light, good looking, has lots of RAM, a large hard drive, plenty of USB ports (3), great speakers for a laptop, exceptional battery life, runs cool and quiet, boots quickly, well priced considering all the features, and seems quite solid. The touchpad is easy to use, although I turned off \"tapping\" (a unless, annoying feature of laptops, IMHO). Its size is perfect for travel, although perhaps a bit small as a desktop replacement. It doesn't come with any software to speak of, which is fine with me as I install my own software. The ExpressGate feature is not of much interest to me -- the resolution is lower than when in Windows, it doesn't do e-mail, and I can wait a few extra seconds to view the web. I haven't yet tried the facial recognition software, so I can't comment on that, but the web cam is adequate (if you care about such things).

This is a great little laptop, but minor niggles and annoying design choices keep it from being the perfect notebook/thin-and-light computer.The pros, as so many others have written it down before me: light-weight, powerful-enough for most purposes (I haven't tried running my Igor Pro codes on this yet), Win7 is pretty cool (I skipped Vista; Win7 = Vista cleaned up?), pretty nice speakers*, long battery life (though I get only 5-6 hours, but w/o battery saving mode or with, but running an external webcam**.)  Small power adapter.  Smart-login (using the included webcam) works on-and-off, depending on the lighting conditions (d-uh!) and on the security settings you employ (I have it on the factory-default.)  Large hard-drive.The cons and niggles, or what in my view prevents this little nugget from being a true contender:1) *Speakers face downwards! So when it's on my lap, I have to be careful not to cover the speakers, otherwise the neat sound gets muffled.UPDATE: From the ASUS website, \"The angle of the speakers also allows audio to be `bounced' upwards from any surface to provide better amplification, delivering a wider frequency range, which in turn produces lower pitches that allow users to hear every reverberation of the drums, as well as every note in pitch perfect quality.\" Ummm... sure.2) The battery was initially tight in it's slot, but has started jiggling (yes, I have locked it properly.)  Duct tape? :-)3) The price of being a sub-4lb notebook: no optical drive.  I just purchased an eMedia guitar learning software pack - which comes as a CD - and had to dig out my old external DVD-writer.  I am hoping that most of my not-on-TV-movie-watching and software will be downloads. [Thankfully, the eMedia upgrade from v4, which I have, to v5 is a download.]4) Dirt and finger-print magnet.5) I tried removing the plastic from the touch-pad, but it started behaving erratically (glue remnants from the sticker?), so I put the plastic back on.  I use an external mouse (trackball) when possible.6) **Webcam is just 0.3 MP, which is barely OK for video-chats.  I use an external, higher-resolution webcam to record my dog when I am away (she's getting over separation anxiety issues.)7) UPDATE: Just remembered: No Bluetooth (available on the Vt series.)

{"Title":"Excellent laptop, not-so-great service","Author":"M. Jean","ReviewID":"R2Z4OP49ES9Q1P","Overall":"good","Content":"This laptop gets 5 stars itself, but ASUS gets 2 stars for service.  Hope that you don't have any issues.About ASUS service:I purchased the UL30A-X5 from Amazon the day it was released.  After about a week of use, I began to have problems with the hard drive (unsure if it was a problem with the drive itself or perhaps the connection to the motherboard).  The HDD is the most delicate part of a laptop, so I wasn't upset because it happens.  I called ASUS and explained the problem, and they told me I could either return the laptop (and pay for my own shipping materials; they wouldn't send a box) or they could send me a new hard drive, but I would have to pay to ship the old one back.  I chose to return the laptop since I still had my Amazon shipping materials.  They also wanted me to FAX a copy of my receipt, and said the department that processes returns could not accept an emailed scan because they didn't have an email address.  They kept the laptop for 2 weeks after receiving it.  I called several times in the meantime, and the CSRs never had any information on the repair status or estimated time to repair.  They have an online tool where you can supposedly look up your repair status with your RMA number, but it never worked for me.  They told me I would be notified whenever it was fixed, but I never was.  Delivery requires a signature, so not sending me a notice or tracking number (so I would know when to be home to receive it) was quite an omission.  To their credit, they did replace the entire laptop, but the entire process was inferior to the experiences I've had with returns to both HP and Dell.About the laptop itself:PROS:-One of the lightest laptops for its screen size.  From the moment I received the shipping box I was amazed at how light it was.-Battery life is very good, although shorter than that of the UL30A-A2 and similar models (it comes with a 4400 mAh battery versus a 5600).  I get about 6-8 hours out of it under normal usage.-Processor isn't a powerhouse but everything runs smoothly.  Windows 7 works great on it. 4GB DDR3 RAM means no stuttering even with many applications going at once.-Keyboard is full size and keys are evenly spaced.  I have long fingers but can still type perfectly, unlike with a netbook.-Plenty of ports, inc. HDMI output-The brushed aluminum lid does look great, especially in black!-Price represents outstanding valueCONS:-Has a high-pitched whine sometimes, I think from the HDD spinning up.  Only noticeable whenever when the room is very quiet, and only because the rest of the laptop (particularly the fans) are so quiet.-No optical drive. You can use Daemon Tools Lite for reading .iso files, but if Windows is corrupted it might make restoring difficult.  The laptop does come with a recovery DVD, although you would have to find an external DVD reader that will work without Windows drivers if you ever needed to restore it.-Screen is really glossy and reflective.-Weak webcam-Comes with a moderate amount of bloatware (including trial media burning and label making software for the non-existent optical drive)Overall I am very pleased with the laptop (now that I finally have a working one after a month!)  I'm not sure I would consider it a desktop replacement, but if you already have a desktop at home/work or your computing needs are light, it makes an excellent travel companion.  It's shortcomings are greatly outweighed by its positives.  It looks and feels like a much more expensive machine, comparing favorably (in my opinion) even to the Macbook Air.","Date":"November 26, 2009"}

So, I been using it for over a month now. WOW! What a great laptop. This is my first personal laptop and I'm very pleased. I used my brother's laptop before purchasing this one. It runs great, and it's very quiet. I love how light it is. I'm a college student and I take it to class almost every day and it doesn't add that much weight to my already heavy backpack.Pros:*Battery life: I don't need to worry about ever carrying the power cord with me if it's fully charged or even at 50%.*Keyboard: The chiclet keyboard is so comfortable to use.*Multi-Touch Touchpad comes in handy.*LED Screen: Perfect size, not too small not too big*Doesn't burn my legs when I use it for long periods of time.*Overall a \"sexy\" laptop. I love the aluminum and the material around the keyboard has blue sparkles on it (not gaudy at all). This is subtle, but it's enough to separate it from all other plain boring laptops.Cons:*Fingerprints magnet: I don't see this as a major problem. I carry a microfiber cloth in my laptop bag, so it's always a quick fix.*The webcam sucks. Luckily I don't use webcams often and I already have a great one by Logitech.I also purchased the ASUS USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive SDRW-08D1S-U to go along with the laptop. It's very slick and goes great with the laptop.I'm a new fan of ASUS!","Date":"December 9, 2009"}
{"Title":"Do Not Depend on the Accidental Damage Warranty","Author":"Steve","ReviewID":"RRXSLUK2S222A","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this laptop primarily because the price was just as good as other laptops with the same specs, but it had the Accidental Damage Warranty provided by ASUS.  THAT WAS A MISTAKE.  DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS WARRANTY.  Horrible customer service experience continues...About 6 months after buying my laptop and registering for the ADW, I dropped my laptop and cracked the screen.  Bummer, but I remembered I had the ADW.Long story short - they never processed my ADW paperwork.  Had to reregister, emailing several documents several times, giving up, and finally FAXING the documents in to ASUS before I could even begin the claim.Sent my laptop in (after 3 weeks of delay due to their paperwork issues) and they now have my laptop essentially hostage.  I have spent COUNTLESS hours on the phone for 2 months trying to get my laptop back.  They will not contact the repair center.  They will not let me speak to a supervisor.  They will not tell me when the part will come in.  They will not tell me when my laptop will be returned to me.  They will not release the laptop, unrepaired, back to me to fix myself.I have now been without my laptop for 2 months.  I do not know if I will ever receive it back repaired.  I've found stories just like mine all over the internet.  I love(d) my laptop when it worked.  Unfortunately, I will not give ASUS my money ever again due to their terrible customer service.

I cannot comment on what it came pre-installed with, because I wiped-it out to install Windows7-Ultimate, because of the language-pack support. I had to go through some pain to do a clean-install of Ultimate without a DVD-Rom, but, a USB-key with WinPE did the trick.I was amazed to find that all the pheripheral had in box drivers or drivers from windows-update.When I got the laptop to work, my colleagues mistaken the laptop for a Sony, for its sophisticated style, the lightweightness, the display, and the overall quality of the keyboard.I was skeptical of the non integrated video card, but, it performed well with iTunes HD stuff (and iTunes is the worst implementation of any HD player out there).","Date":"November 6, 2009"}
{"Title":"Best small laptop there is - don't wait buy it now!","Author":"reverbfreak","ReviewID":"R7CSDIRMBDZ71","Overall":"good","Content":"There are many folks that have written extensively about this laptop.  I'm just going to make my review simple and to the point.  I ordered it here on Amazon for $679 w/shipping.  I see they are now selling it for $[...] - that's no shipping cost and no tax, you will not beat this deal.  I also purchased the Square Trade warranty to cover issues for 3 years.  There's nothing more frustrating than having a display go bad on you after a year or two, so I think it's worth purchasing the extended warranty.The laptop is everything you are going to want, it's fast, it's sleek, it comes only with a few \"bloatware\" products such as Trend Micro AV (uninstall and install Microsoft Security Essentials [free]), and a trial version of MS Home Office (your choice what to do with this one), and that's about it.Some folks complain about the trackpad.  It's quite sensitive and the double-finger scroll is too fast, but these features can be adjusted so it works pretty good.  The display is great, clear and vibrant, sound is quite good but don't expect low bass tones, the speakers are too small, but there's good volume.The drive is partitioned into C: and D: when it comes, and using Windows 7 is not that difficult.  I am a Windows 7 neophyte having used XP for years.  I like Windows 7 - once you get used to how the menu displays, and you can adjust some of the menu features to suit your needs.  The \"find program\" feature just above the start button helps you find where functions/programs are that are not readily apparent when you first start.  Overall the Windows 7 experience for me has been fine, different, but better.  I like it.I also purchased Acronis True Image so I could create drive backups - this is a program I've been using for years and it is the best imaging software available so you have peace of mind regarding your system crashing.  You can set up another boot partition and write a drive image directly to the internal drive, another image to the D: partition, and it can be copied to USB external drive or DVDs.  Check Acronis out, it's great.Overall I am 100% satisfied with the laptop, it's features, speed, looks, ease of use, etc.  It's quiet, cool, and has no flaws.  By the way, don't believe the 12-hour battery life advertising.  If you are running the laptop at full display (default), and you run on the batteries, the indicator says about 6 hours.  I expect if you dim the laptop some that time lengthens.  Either way it's plenty of time to run on batteries, and it charges back up pretty fast.  There's a very good review on [...], besides the one here on Amazon.I have absolutely no regrets on this purchase, and I read tons of reviews, and compared small profile laptops for at least two months before buying the Asus UL30A-X5.  If I needed another small laptop, I'd buy another.One last thing, as you know from considering this laptop, the screen is small when compared to a standard 15\" laptop, so not all web pages display in full view so you have to scroll down a little more, so keep this in mind if you buy this item.  The fact that it is so light, portable, user-friendly, and fast, clear, bright, quiet and a smooth piece of electronic engineering overweighed this for me.Take out your credit card and buy the Asus if you are hesitating, you won't be sorry.","Date":"March 16, 2010"}

It's strange that I DON'T have any issues with touchpad and wireless dropping signal. Some people are complaining that touchpad might register some click while you type.

I was also considering buying Acer Timeline 3810 but after reading all the reviews I decided to go with this one.PROS:- Stylish, very well made,- Keyboard is great,- Multi-touch track pad works just fine,- No heating problems at all.- Very good configuration,- Battery life around 6 hours (if you have WIFI on, surfing the net and watch some videos or listen to the music),- Very light and portable,- Loud quality speakers from small size,- Warranty- PriceCONS:- Fingerprint magnet (inside and outside)- Camera (only 0.3)- No BluetoothDisplay is bright and vivid and a little bit glossy.Overall, this is far the best laptop you will find right now on the market considering the price and performance.","Date":"December 12, 2009"}
{"Title":"Great Value as a Travel PC","Author":"B. Wang","ReviewID":"R2PF0HNSPY0Q7A","Overall":"good","Content":"I spend a lot of time on the computer and also on the road. Needless to say I found myself needing to have two computers (in case one of them goes down). I originally purchased the Asus 1000HA as my travel laptop but found the screen size and keyboard annoying, plus the netbook was just too slow sometimes. The UL30A solves the problems I faced with the netbook and is great for traveling. The keyboard is comfortable and the screen is bright. Windows 7 works very well with this machine setup, and despite the low processor speed, I found this laptop does a lot of the common tasks very well.The only real downside I have with the UL30A is the material construction. The plastic for the main casing feels cheap and absolutely attracts fingerprints to no end. The bottom of the laptop is made from a rough feel plastic and also feels cheap. Overall though this is s very solid laptop for the road warriors.","Date":"October 24, 2009"}
{"Title":"Good Value","Author":"Alex Mueller","ReviewID":"R3HTFH4HD8229F","Overall":"good","Content":"This notebook is a great value and I would recommend it for someone who has a desktop and needs a notebook for traveling (like me) or someone who has a notebook already and needs a second one that is lighter and more compact. Wouldn't necessarily recommend this notebook as your only notebook unless you didn't need a graphics card or an optical drive but if you did, why are you looking at this notebook?This is a thin and light notebook so that means it between a netbook (which is garbage) and a full featured notebook. Thin and light notebooks have a low voltage CPU, no optical drive, no video card (more than likely), long battery life and perhaps a SSD drive. The best thing to compare this to is a Dell Adamo. But an Adamo cost more than twice as much and it's not worth twice as much over this. For those Mac people (yes your are a people) the 13\" Macbook Pro is basically the same dimensions and the same thickness however it has a graphics card and an optical drive. Even though I never owned a Mac I was contemplating it. The Mac does cost 1000, though you might be able to get one for 900 after rebate. Processor is faster too but less RAM and battery life is not as long.Before I give my review some people complained you can't play games. Well you can play games. You just can't play games with high frame rates those would be your first person shooters and auto racing games. I don't play those games so I don't care. I played Tales of Monkey Island (great series BTW) on it for a bit and it played well. Now I won't lie to you, it wasn't as smooth as on my desktop but it played about 85% comparably. The frames didn't lag just the cursor moved slow. Could be because I was using the touchpad, I didn't have a mouse. Played well enough to enjoy the game.You also say you can't edit video and use Maya on the computer, true. But who would want to? You need a 3 button mouse for Maya and who wants to model on a 13 inch screen with a 1366x768 resolution? The horror. Also if you are going to edit video chances are you need an optical drive and you probably would want a bigger screen as well. This isn't the notebook for that stuff. A desktop is way better for that unless you need to edit in the field on the go.The notebook is pretty fast and good at multitasking. Photoshop 64 bit runs well on it. The notebook is also ultra quite, you don't even know it's on. It did make some noise though when I was streaming video online. That was the only time it made noise though. It also doesn't get hot when on your lap, which is great, because most notebooks are like a heating pad. I played some 1080 HD video I shot with my camcorder over an external hard drive. It played it really well no lag time or anything. This is important since I want to get an external Blu Ray drive since no computer under 1800 comes with one built-in. That's why I didn't care if it had an optical drive because no notebook has the drive I want.Battery life test, I went on a flight across country. First flight was about 4 hours and 15 minutes. I used the notebook probably for about 3 and half hours or more. On the second flight I used it for about 20 minutes cause I fell asleep for most of the flight. So total time was probably 4 hours usage. It had about 63% battery left. It probably would go for 9 hours. Important thing to keep in mind is that if you want the long battery life you need to keep the brightness way down. I took it off the built-in settings. In order to get about 9 hours the brightness needs to be about 2 of the slider notches above the lowest settings. So the third setting in from the left. Now that isn't very bright but it is bright enough to see and do things on the notebook. If you make the screen any brighter you will lose battery life. I don't see how you can get 12 hours unless it is on the lowest brightness setting and you don't do much other than surf the web. But what's the point? So don't buy this and expect 12 hours or regular usage it won't happen.Someone said the viewing angles aren't the greatest. Well yes if you stand up and look at the screen it's washed you can't see it. But if you are directly in front of it you can see fine. You can also view it off centered to the left and right and see the screen fine. It's like any other notebook screen. If you have the brightness as high as it goes, the screen is really bright and I do mean bright!The only negatives are, yes it does pick up a lot of fingerprints. But so do all gadgets these days. The webcam really does suck. Not sure why they would put a 0.3MP camera in a notebook made in 2009, but they did. Not that MP is the only thing that matters for quality but still. I'll probably never use it anyway but it is nice to have if you need it. For the life of me I can't use the multi-gesture touchpad. Now I did have problems on a Mac so maybe it's just me. But I can never get it to scroll and when I finally do it is like ultra sensitive and goes all the way in that direction. Not a big deal it's more of a gimmick but maybe I'll get the hang of it.I wish the processor was a little faster but it's still good, so thumbs up by me. For 650 it's well worth it.","Date":"December 25, 2009"}
{"Title":"Great Laptop - I have a full blown geek crush","Author":"R. Johnsen","ReviewID":"R3HS0ERGHEW33O","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this laoptop for two weeks and very pleased with this fine piece of technology. I am a college student (Engineer) and this laptop is perfect for productivity around campus all day, as well as entertainment in the form of music and video. I did fair amount of research before my purchase, and know what I'm talking about.Here is a quick rundown of the specs and my comments on each one.* 1.3GHz Intel SU7300 Core 2 Duo Processor-- Very Fast processor, runs windows7 perfectly. Better processor than all other thin and lights in this price range. Don't be mislead by the low speed specs. This ultra low voltage processor is the key to having great battery life.* 4GB of DDR3 RAM, 2 slots, 4GB Max-- Better quality RAM than most other laptops, 4GB is more than enough for some multitasking. (I currently have 5 firefox tabs open, itunes, and Word to type this review.) Non-upgradeable, I wish there was a little room for future enhancements, not a deal breaker.* 500GB SATA Hard Drive (5400 RPM)-- More space than I need. I've had no problems with the hard drive making noise.* 13.3\" HD LED LCD Display-- Very bright display. It is GLOSSY, don't understand why everyone hates the gloss, I like it, videos look sharp.*Intel GMA 4500MH-- Average graphics card. I am not a gamer, or a video editor, and therefore have no need for the intense graphics.*0.3M Webcam-- Terrible web cam. It is very low resolution. Very slow, grainy, and dark. The facial login feature didn't really work. This is the only hardware on the laptop that is not top notch. oh well.* Windows 7 Home Premium Operating System (64 bit)-- Love windows 7. File transfer was very convenient, took a while using the wireless option, but automatically transferred all of my documents, internet settings, and some preferences.* Aesthetics-- Very sexy machine. Black aluminum outside finish is nice, gets some fingerprints. Interior glossy black plastic looks nice, gets a lot of fingerprints. My macbook toting roommate is envious.*Battery-- Mine gets about 8 hours on the entertainment setting. Make sure you lock the batter in properly, there are two locking slides. Ive read some complaints about the battery not fitting snugly, mine is pretty secure.*Track pad-- Nice, not great not terrible. Much better than HP's trackpad. Not as good as Sony's. Multi touch works great.*Keyboard-- Nice size and keys have a good bounce. Right hand shift key is small and I am still getting used to it. There is a little flex when typing.*No Optical Disk Drive-- Who cares?*Expressgate-- this is a Linux based OS that lets you surf, skype, IM, and view pictures. Have not used it extensively, but can say it actually does boot in 8 seconds. The web browser is sub-par, so if you want to browse for more than, well 8 seconds... Just use Windows (boots in 30-45 seconds).As previously mentioned I am and engineering student, have have installed MATLAB and SolidWorks and both work great. You can be confident that this laptop will run big, processor heavy programs to do any design, simulation, or programming. Oh and it can run Facebook like a boss.At the end of the day, I love this laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for portability, functionality, and some sex-appeal. ASUS knows how to put together a quality notebook. Warranty included adds even more value, Amazon shipped it in 2 days for free.","Date":"December 18, 2009"}

It is a nice laptop that fits well within your laps and its light for everyday portability. Its well suited for someone like myself who needs a light notebook to work on and do daily simple task: email, documentations, spreadsheets, surfing the wed, youtube and typing reports.The ul30a-x5 is not perfect though. Its not as elegant as a mac book pro but consumers you also have to remember that this laptop is not meant to be, not at the sub $700 price point! If you can overlook that fact and that it is not a powerhouse but a dependable laptop then you, along as with me, will be very satisfied with this purchase.The black outer case looks great and does attract plenty of finger prints (which can be also easily wiped down)The battery life is not 12 hours as it claims as i have used it. At most i have gotten 8 hours but i like to work with the screen brightness all the way up and multitasking at the same time. I dont believe in reducing brightness levels to bare minimum to converse battery power because i bought this laptop to do my work so i would like to see the screen as best as can be.The built in webcam is rather disappointing especially during skype video calls.The touchpad is probably the function i hate the most about this laptop, it feels weird, it responds weird with too much responsiveness at times and none at other (bought a notebook mouse but still you shouldnt have to for a notebook)However even with its flaws, considering the price i paid for such a laptop, i am deeply happy with the purchase and would recommend it to other peers.The specs are somewhat up to date and the processor isn't that bad at all.","Date":"May 14, 2010"}

Very nice screen, quiet and powerful enough for daily use. Soft keys, just the way I like them, but mileage may vary with different users. Changing to a SSD is a matter of removing one panel in the back to swap out the drive, should take no more than 3 minutes. Battery doesn't really fit 100% snuggly and has a bit of play when installed, no big deal. In my opinion, it is worth the additional $250 compared to an 12.1\" netbook, since it weights about the same but has a better and larger screen, 4GB DDR3 , a battery lasts forever and other goodies! You can even overclock 5% from the bios. Have a feeling my son will grab it when he comes back from college for Thanksgiving.

{"Title":"Battery life is not as rated...","Author":"Danny H. Kwon \"dkwon\"","ReviewID":"R1TLKZ67XGNIUV","Overall":"good","Content":"Buyer beware. If you're considering this laptop because 10 hr+ battery life is a priority for you, look again. This laptop does not have anywhere near the 12 hours battery life as advertised. The most i've seen the battery life icon give it in Windows is 8 hrs (for just a few seconds before it dropped to 6) but in reality, real life time is more like 4-5 hrs of continuous use (word processing, internet surfing, emails). Decent battery life but not near the 8-10 hrs reviewers have been giving. Why the discrepancy? Here's what I've determined. The UL30A-X5 comes with an 8 cell battery but rated at 4800 mah (65wh). Just looking on ebay, there are 8 cell batteries rated at 5600 mah (85wh) or more for the UL30A which would give it better life. Plus, you can get 12 cell 7800mah (112wh) batteries which I presume would give you perhaps more than the 12 hrs as advertised for about $70 on ebay. But this laptop doesn't come with it either one of those longer life batteries. So long story short, I'm guessing that ASUS has swapped out the battery which gave the UL30A 12 hr battery life with a smaller capacity one that gives you good battery life, but not the 12 hrs as advertised. Nowhere on the laptop itself (you know how they advertise features using stickers) or packaging does ASUS advertise 12 hr battery life for this model. Just in the Amazon product description, the customer reviews, and in older laptop reviews can you find mention of the 12 hr battery life. Very misleading.Otherwise, the keyboard is good for typing. Screen is nice but overall, the computer is too glossy for my liking. Looks cheap. Speed is great for playing even 1080p video streams. Blu-ray compatibility test (cyberlink BD and 3D advisor) tells me this computer can play blu-ray no problem (just need to connect an external BD player). Wireless connection is fast with N connection. Speakers are good for a small laptop. Boot up time is 55 seconds from off to the Windows desktop. There is a nifty 8 second bootup feature which dumps you into DVD player, Internet and skype almost instantly. But the resolution is fuzzy so i don't know why you'd want to surf the web this way. Hard drive speed, while it's only 5400 rpm, is fast and quiet. In fact, this laptop is very quiet and stays fairly cool. And it is thin and very, very light.In conclusion, I was prepared to live with a glossy computer, slower cpu and smaller screen because of the long battery life. But now I'm stuck with a laptop that is an older core duo and I still don't have super long battery life. You can get a much more functional laptop (ie. DVD burner included and at least an i3 processor) which is only a bit heavier with similar battery life to this ASUS for the same price. But here's a thought. If I get an extra 12 cell battery off ebay for $70 and keep the current 8 cell for backup, I should be able to run almost 14-18 hrs continuously before I have to charge. Great for long transcontinental flights. Maybe I'll keep it.","Date":"March 2, 2011"}

{"Title":"Another hit for ASUS","Author":"MW","ReviewID":"R3UZ1BZSZZJMKM","Overall":"good","Content":"Aside from one minor problem, this really is a spectacular laptop.REASON FOR PURCHASE: My old laptop was an ASUS F3SE which unfortunately died and needed to be replaced. This was a heavy 15.6\"/dedicated graphics, thick machine which ended up also being a pain to lug around.  I looked into netbooks and decided that they were really too small for what I needed. I have a desktop but wanted something for travel and around the house.If you are considering between this and a netbook, get this!THE REVIEW:WeightAfter opening everything up Windows 7 finally got configured and I could start using the laptop. First of all this machine is LIGHT! I was surprised when I put the battery in how light it really is. At the same time the laptop feels solid, so you don't have that trade-off between quality materials and weight reduction. Ultra-portable is definitely a great way to describe it.Feel/AestheticsAs I said, the laptop feels absolutely solid. Even thought the inside is made of shiny black plastic, it's not thin. The lid/screen moves easily on the hinges, while at the same time not sliding to the sides or left to right. Also, the screen does a good job of staying where you set it and not sliding down toward the closed position. Speaking of, the lid closes well without any noticeable gaps as some laptops have. The one complaint about the laptop's aesthetics is that is shows off fingerprints like crazy. any time you touch it (the lid or the body) you get a nice fat print of whatever hand was there - this is not a big deal since you can just wipe it down, but still a minor annoyance. Finally, a few people have complained that the screen is too glossy. It is very glossy, but not enough  to make it difficult to use, and this is only an issue when the screen is very dark. Once you star using programs you can't even notice it.Usability/FeaturesObviously you are getting something without a DVD+/- RW so you lose some weight and bulk, but also the feature. Look into the ASUS SDRW-08D1S-U as an external solution, it's pretty solid as well. I got that as a combo purchase with this and it works well. It looks like it goes together. It's noteworthy that you are asked to make a DVD backup when you fist boot up - but they also give you a driver and OS Cd, as well as a recovery partition. (Side note: They actually have 3 partitions, 1 recovery (hidden), 1 OS, 1 Data. I merged the Data and OS). You will probably neve use fast gate btw, it's fun, but not that worth it. (FastGate is their linux program that boots the computer in 10 seconds and does basic web browsing and music playing... maybe that's why they have 3 partitions! Uh Oh.. more on that later.There is plenty of power under the hood here. The 4GB of RAM makes it snappy, although this is somewhat undermined by a slower processor (my desktop has 1Gb Ram (PC5200) and a C2D @ 3.1 Ghz, sometimes if feels faster). Overall things seem to run well. Windows 7 has a lot of services in the background and if you don't uninstall ASUS's features then they will run too. Speaking of, you should uninstall most of them. They are pointless. Keep the Power4Gear though. Also, another way that you are saving battery is with integrated graphics. I was worried about Intel's 4500HD but I did some research and didn't see too much knocking it down. Integrated is never going to compare well to dedicated graphics, but what are you really using this laptop for? If you want graphics, get a different model (Asus has plenty of other great ones). Also, my old laptop which had a dedicated card had a LOUD fan and got VERY hot. This the UL30A- series has stay cool technology which actually does work. While the laptop might get a bit warm, it is never very much and it takes a while of being in the same spot. I can't say I've found it to be truly uncomfortable on either the top or bottom.One other complaint that I have is the sound quality. It's pretty terrible - when you have the laptop on your lap. The speakers are on the underside of the chassis so your legs will muffle it. Supposedly this is some sound enhancing technique that bounces the sound off of a table to give it more definition, but that sounds like a stretch. Nonetheless, the laptop does sounds better when I set it down in front of me, not so much as to 'WOW' me, but enough to interest me and make note.I also tested the HDMI output. I grabbed a HD (720p) video from YouTube and played it over HDMI. There was some slight stuttering (barely noticeable) when played on my TV, but I think this is from VLC (the media player) indexing files as well as the laptop showing the clip both in its own screen and passing it to the TV. I need to try this JUST on the TV, but I think it will be fine. I played some full 1080 clips on the TV as well and they looked fine. I can say that I am confident the HDMI is solid and will perform admirably. I was surprised at how well it handled normal use and the second video - especially for an integrated graphics card.Next, the battery. I saw a lot of questions about what size it is, how many cells, what's the length, etc. Well, it boils down to this - it depends on what you do. I was running 3 or 4 installations and burning a CD and it dropped pretty quickly. I saw 4:10 at only 68%. However, after I was finished, I kept using the laptop (web browsing, music, etc) and was still at 4 hours when the battery decreased to 54%. So it is all relative to what you are using the laptop for. In full disclosure I have tweaked the settings on Power4Gear. I don't need the brightness up in Quiet Office. Since the screen is usually the largest consumer of battery, I felt that it was worth it. P4G also lets you set upper limits on the CPU, so I changed that just a bit. Oh, and the stickers on the laptop say 10 hours, not 12. It doesn't matter because you can only realistically expect 8 hours at most, but I still wish there was more consistency (see the RMA section below too).I don't have a better place to put this, but the webcam is fine. 0./3 mega pixels is low, and I did notice that there was a large lag in what it picked up (try waving), but for quick video chat where you are just sitting there talking - it's fine.RMA!Finally, my problems section.I am RMA'ing this unit to fix the keyboard. I know I just put up a glowing (almost) review of the unit, but this was manufactured and things can go wrong. I hope this helps people who have not seen a review of their customer service. ASUS always ranks high in this category and I agree with that. Someone said that when looking at the same price point most laptops have the same specs, so it comes down to feel, aesthetics, and customer service - great summation!) Ok, on with it. The left side of the keyboard is loose and it makes an annoying ringing/jingling sound when you type. I was in a meeting and had to stop because it was that noticeable. This is not a functional problem, rather an annoyance. When you pay $600 for a laptop, this shouldn't be an issue. So I called them. It was easy, I was talking to a person after only 2 menu's (so 15 seconds or less) and they gave me two options: 1) they send me a keyboard and I do it or 2) I send it in. I chose the second not because I can't but because if they do it, I don't have to deal with warranty problems in the future if they should come up. So I'll be without my laptop for 2 weeks. They also pay shipping both ways, so it's ok. Oh, and I hear different things different places, its a 1 year manufacturers, and a 1 (parallel) year of Accidental coverage. I thought it was 24mos.Pros:LightGreat battery performancePowerfulCheap!HDMI outCons:The KeyboardPre-installed junkSpeaker placementMajor Complaint:I had to RMA the keyboardBottom Line: Get it. I give the laptop a 9.5 / 10. I really wish there were other things in here like an SSD and USB 3.0, but I paid $600 for it. I can't really complain.I am happy to answer questions the best I can if you reply to this post. Good luck!","Date":"April 16, 2010"}
{"Title":"Excellent laptop, and works really well with Ubuntu 9","Author":"Kevin Hutchinson","ReviewID":"R3EYH9ONNOY90T","Overall":"good","Content":"I already own a Samsung NC10 and an Apple MacBook (the old black version) and was looking for something in between - faster than the NC10 and lighter than the MacBook, essentially a very portable (thin and light) 13\" laptop that I could use to work on Ubuntu (dual boot) as well as Windows 7 for iTunes, movies, Kindle book reader, etc. At first I considered buying the more expensive \"Vt\" versions with dual video cards (native Intel and dedicated Nvidia) but I opted for this more basic laptop with the Intel graphics and it's been a really pleasant surprise. Movies and YouTube look great (no jitters), and Ubuntu runs with all its extra visual effects. The screen is very glossy and bright and fine for outdoor use, the 500GB disk is large enough to dual boot Ubuntu and also carry a copy of your iTunes library, and the 4GB RAM is more than I'm ever likely to need.Unlike other reviewers I have not found the keyboard to be bouncy or have any unwanted travel - in fact it's nicer than my old Apple MacBook keyboard. Also, I really love the trackpad and find the 2-finger scrolling to be exactly like my Apple laptop (except it could do with being a tiny bit less sensitive). I'm getting about 6 hours of battery life but I'm not using any energy-saving features. For me 6 hours is enough, but if you need more then check out the \"Vt\" models which include 5600mAh batteries, e.g. the ASUS UL30Vt-X1 which also includes Bluetooth. (I guess not having Bluetooth is a bit of a pain for cellphone connectivity).I also love the multi-card reader which works fine with both my Sony Cybershot and my Canon Sureshot cameras. This is a real benefit because I don't need to travel with all those USB cables.All in all, I'm super-happy with this laptop and expect to be using it for work and play for at least the next 2 years. Awesome!","Date":"March 24, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great Budget Laptop for People on the Go","Author":"Mattforn","ReviewID":"R2VW7TXMYX63GS","Overall":"good","Content":"This laptop has been amazing so far, great design, portable, excellent display, awesome battery life, it was exactly what i was looking for.When you first get this thing and power it up you will notice that it really doesn't come with a lot of bloatware.  Most of it is Asus Utilities that help make using it easier.  I uninstalled most of the stuff i didn't need and the rest really didn't take up too much memory to run.  One thing that bugged me though was the free trial of Microsoft Office without a serial key.  It would have been nice to have that.  I never really used the ExpressGate so I can't comment on that.  I would recommend deleting the huge empty partition and just merging it into the main Windows one.There are only a couple cons to this laptop.  First is the spacebar, sometimes if you hit it near the edge it wont read it.  Second is the mouse button.  For some strange reason it is getting scratched up in the same spot and is ruining the finish on it.  I have no idea what could be causing it, but its a minor detail.Pros:Great battery, averaged around 6-8 hours with fairly heavy use.Great display and graphics, I have the screen to almost minimum brightness and its still crispCool design, both visually and thermally, very lightweightTrackpad, the different actions you can make with just the pad are cool, it definitely saves a lot of time.Keyboard, it seems to be the perfect size for most hands.Cons:Sometimes it can act a little squirrelly, i think thats more the OS fault.Trackpad, It can be really touchy, I would STRONGLY recommend manually updating the drivers for this, Windows Update seems to miss it.Random Flex on the keyboard surface, more of a nuisance than a problem though.Missing or broken drivers, you would think all the drivers would be up to date but oh well, again just annoying.Overall I would recommend this laptop, do make sure to manually update all the nessecary drivers off of the Asus website, it will fix the webcam issue and the trackpad issue.","Date":"March 8, 2010"}

I did quite a bit of research because I wanted a laptop that was light, ultra portable, has very long battery life (+10 hours) and is still fast enough for me to do sofware development (I am an engineer).I am extremely pleased with this device and can highly recommend it to anybody who has a similar purchase criteria. I want to quickly clarify a few things that I read in other reviews.- some people mentioned that the battery life was only 6 hours instead of the stated 10-12 hours. I disagree, as long as you have Wifi off, do not run heavy multimedia applications (like watching movies) and are in the power saving mode, you will get 10-12 hours.- some people said the battery was loose. I noticed this too, when you put the battery in, it only clips in on the right side of the laptop. There is a small switch (next to a read lock symbol) on the left that you manually have to lock. Once done, your battery is fix and does not move around at all.","Date":"January 30, 2010"}
{"Title":"well-rounded feature set","Author":"Valjean Clark III \"vbud\"","ReviewID":"R12RIRGKQB4GPG","Overall":"good","Content":"I would do a huge feature analysis as usual, but there is a huge wealth of external product reviews and features analyses available for this laptop, so I'll just discuss the features I personally use and care about.This laptop is very light, very thin, and really does get great battery life. It lasts about 8 hours for me, and I am I suppose what you would call a \"power user\" (programming, lots of browsers open, music playing, external monitor, etc.), so I am quite pleased.The performance is not at the level of a full-fledged Core 2 Duo laptop, but it is leaps and bounds ahead of the Atom processor (I also have a netbook). The graphics card can indeed play 720p and 1080p movies, but not as smoothly as an Nvidia graphics card. 2-D and 3-D rendering are also not as smooth, and external monitor and TV support is not as good as I would like. Intel graphics cards seem to pump out really high-contrast and high-sharpness output to external displays. Regardless, I was well aware of the fact that this laptop had an Intel graphics card, so this stuff really doesn't count against the review.The touchpad does have issues with registering palm touches. I've heard of utilities you can install to circumvent this issue, I just haven't looked into them yet. I also installed Ubuntu on it, and the touchpad is even worse. It registers ANY touch at all. Sometimes I don't even notice I have touched it. Yet again, I have not looked into a solution (haven't been using Linux much this past month), just thought it would be useful to mention. The multitouch features are very handy though - love the two-finger scrolling and the three-finger right click. From a design sense, I like how the touchpad is flush with the casing, although I do admit my hand will sometimes slip off the pad and I don't notice right away. Not often though. The mouse buttons are kind of hard to press, but I really don't care because I mainly use tapping.If you do use a Linux distribution often, the drivers in the Ubuntu distros for the wifi card are not spectacular. I get lots of disconnects. I tried to hunt down a better version back in October to no avail, although I should probably check again, since it is a newer wifi chipset and a new driver may have been released...The keyboard is really stellar. The key sizes are consistent and well-spaced. Typing is really quite nice on it.The screen sucks, although I am picky. I also don't count this against the review, since less expensive laptops never have nice screens (with the exception of ASUS's 1005HA netbook). Viewing angles are limited, but there is a sweet spot that is pretty tolerable.You can purchase the UL30VT-X1 for $150 more if you want overclockability and Nvidia GT210M graphics. In the end, I wish I would have, as a nicer video card and faster CPU would hit the sweet spot for me (although it wasn't available when I purchased this). However, this is a lot of laptop for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something faster than a netbook with great battery life and portability.","Date":"December 21, 2009"}

On top of the incredible specs of this laptop, the Asus UL is so visually stunning you will make even your friends with Apple products turn their heads and ask what is that!My only two concerns with the laptop were the mousepad sensitivity and not having a backlit keyboard.  I can definitely live without the backlit keyboard, but I am still trying to figure out how to adjust the mouse pad sensitivity, I think I may need to install the latest driver... when I figure out how to do this I will write an addition to my review.Overall, I could not be more happy with this laptop!!!","Date":"November 26, 2009"}

I was planning on reloading it with Linux (Ubuntu 10.04) when I bought it. I also purchased an Intel X25-V SSD replacement hard drive at the same time. While I have no idea what the Windows 7 performance is (never even booted the stock drive), the Linux performance on the SSD is quite impressive. After performing some of the recommended configuration changes to accommodate the SSD, my boot time is under 15 seconds (from switch-on to login). Running productivity related software (office, browser, IDEs) I have never notice any performance lag. I've started using this system to prove that processor speed is not the remedy to performance problems.Battery life has been good in 2-3 hour chunks with WiFi going, but I haven't pushed it to 8+ hours endurance yet. This is the first laptop that I've used where I felt like I could leave the power brick behind when I leave the house.It's still a fingerprint magnet, and it would have made my life a lot easier if they had used a Synaptics touchpad, but all an all a good solid system that does it's job at a good price.

{"Title":"Not impressed","Author":"TP","ReviewID":"R17Y2F1X0IC7OP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this computer because of all the great reviews. I returned it within the first 30 days because I just wasn't impressed with this laptop at all. MAYBE it could be argued that it's worth $600 but I decided that I'd rather take that amount and put it toward a better laptop.Construction leaves a LOT to be desired. It's made out of hard plastic, maybe that's the norm these days, but I didn't find it sturdy enough to be confident that nothing would damage it easily.In all honesty, this laptop was literally NO FASTER (and in some cases slower) than my 5 year old Sony Vaio laptop. I was pretty astonished by this and had expected that technology would have improved more in the last 5 years than this. My vaio has a single core, 2.0 Ghz processor, a 100 GB hard drive (5400 rpm) and 2G RAM. I haven't done anything on either laptop other than the normal web browsing and using common programs like Microsoft office, pdfs, play music and watch dvds.I also found Windows 7 to be INCREDIBLY resource heavy and slow! I even put it in XP mode - looks and functions like XP, no frills. And still it was eating up my memory and this thing comes with 4g RAM!I honestly am not happy with Microsoft, nor was I happy with this product. I'm one of those who never saw a problem with Windows XP in the first place to necessitate an upgrade. I think everyone knows that Vista was a huge fail and really, I think the only reason why people are so excited about Windows 7 is because Vista was so bad that 7 now looks like a life saver in comparison. I'll stop my rant now.If you don't have high expectations than you might be satisfied with this computer. It was very light, I can say that about it, and it did look pretty nice with incredible battery life. But otherwise I think it'd be wiser to take your $600 and put it toward a better system. OR get a cheap 12\" netbook with XP or another less resource intensive operating system like Ubuntu or another linux distribution.","Date":"June 6, 2010"}

But it cleans as easily as it smudges. Yes, the screen does have a limited viewing angle. But how often do you change your vertical position while using a computer. Yes, it does come with an enormous amount of pre-installed software. But it does give you the option of reformatting the hard drive to remove partitions and only install what you want.There is no reason to complain about the trackpad -- it's easy to use and works like a charm.So far, then, so good.

It's portable enough to take to class but still powerful enough to multitask, and the battery lasts long enough that I don't even bother bringing the power cord with me. It's great to have my computer with me at all times without having to lug around some six-pound beast of a laptop.Pros: Lightweight, attractive, and reasonably fast (no, it's not a suitable gaming machine, but it's really not intended to be). The keyboard is surprisingly nice to type on. It's by far the best laptop keyboard I've ever used. I thought it might be a little cramped, but it's virtually the same size as full-sized laptop keyboards. The multitouch pad is nice and very intuitive to use. It also manages to cram in an HDMI port and a memory card reader. The screen has a pretty good viewing angle, even though it does glare a bit much.Cons: Yes, it's a fingerprint magnet. They could tone down the gloss on the screen, too. The touchpad is a little sensitive, as others have said, but it really hasn't caused me much trouble, and I figure it can be fixed by tweaking the settings a bit. I haven't noticed the chassis squeaking that some reviewers have complained about. Also, it comes with a lot of Asus bloatware installed, but that's easy enough to remove. The dual partition setup on the hard drive is a little more annoying, but it can be fixed.If you don't want the drive split in two partitions, just go into the built-in system recovery utility BEFORE you set up the computer by pressing F9 during bootup. Then you can recover Windows to the entire hard drive rather than just the first partition. Yes, it's an annoying extra step to have to go through to have all your data on one partition, but it's better to do it before you transfer all your files over.","Date":"February 25, 2010"}

My personal views, I LOVE the chiclet keyboard, the display, the way the notebook looks and being new to Win7, love that too.  I bought this laptop for personal use during military deployment overseas (needed thin, light, long battery life, big storage, integrated webcam).  My main gripe is with the webcam.  The ASUS SmartLogOn software was a cool feature initially, until I tried to use Skype for a video call with my wife.  Apparently the SmartLogOn facial recognition software runs continuously in the background, which makes it so that no other programs can use the webcam.  Unfortunately it seems like this problem has been brought up to ASUS several times with no posted resolution or software update to the SmartLogOn software.  Until ASUS pays attention, the best solution seems to be uninstalling the SmartLogOn software and restarting your notebook, which worked for me.  What is otherwise a budget friendly thin and light with a great feature set (for what I needed), is hindered by the fact that it doesn't even work with the ASUS webcam image capture software much less Skype, YouTube, GoogleTalk etc out of the box... which is really really sad.  That the product still manages a 4 start rating out of me however despite this disappointing flaw should tell you how happy I am despite the big flaw.","Date":"February 22, 2010"}

Don't look anything else.The color is also nice black. The laptop is everthing that they said to be(except one little fact, I will discuss below)I ordered the laptop for my school use(I am in health professional school), and program didn't run on my previous netbook(LG X130, they are super fast and reliable netbook by the way). UPS, lost my shipment and thankfully Amazon.com acted fast and got my laptop pretty fast(I am always amazed with Amazon's service).First time I unwrapped it, it was beauty. So light without battery, I thought i was just picking up 1-subject notebook. Even with battery it is way much lighter than my 1-subject binder(some papers inside). The screen size is great, sound great, the touch pad works great. Here is some pros and cons.Pros:1. Nice looking laptop2. Very portable(light and thin, weight just about same or less than my 10inch netbook)3. window 7 works fast after some tweak and after remove bloatwares.4. Touch pad works great.5. Mac-like keyboard with great feedback and comportable size.6. Very cool(temperature wise) laptop. put on your belly and never felt heat.7. Very well-built(it's solid feeling. My unit's battery fits perfectly without any empty space(battery doesn't feel lose it all, once you lock it)8. FAST. I don't know about quad core, but for dual core and portable laptop it's faster than you ever needs.(I can't say anything about hard-core game play because I don't play games on my laptop. I play on my Xbox360 or PS3)9. Good HDMI connect with plenty USB plugs.10. Sound is above average laptop speaker.11. Screen is nice except the glossy-feel.(it doesn't really bother me)Cons:1. In US model, the right Shift is smaller than I would like to be (first few times I pressed 'up' button instead of right SHIFT key).- this is biggest cons to me.2. battery does not last as advertised. But they to last pretty long(~8 to 9 hours with lower brightness. Brightness controls most of battery drain in my opinion)3. Angle of view(this is complain from my friend. I personally use this is personal laptop and doesn't want too many people to see what I do on laptop in class or in public. so I like this feature but everyone have different preference)I am somewhat laptop lover and collector(I usually buy laptops every 6month and not really into desktop, that's my dad's specialty), I own about 5 laptops(including 17inch samsung laptop and ACER TIMELINE, Dell xps laptop, etc)and couple of Netbooks(eeepc 901, LG Xnote X130) at this moment(countless previous laptops since the 8-bit and 16-bit computer). I would rather carry around UL30a-x5 than netbook. Netbooks are great but too small and performance is nowhere close to regular laptop. I would probably compare this to ACER timeline, but in most all of spec-wise, ASUS beats ACER(Acer's timeline is great thin laptop but built quality is no where near my standard)ASUS is pretty well-established company, and they know what consumer wants. They have evolved alot since eeepc. I recommended Asus to my friends and they love it. You can't ignore the 'free 1-time replacement' deal.(I have never used it but feels like good insurance).So, if you are looking to by thin stylish laptop, that is for school or personal use, not hard-core game, then don't hasitate to buy this one. You will not regret it.P.S: with Wi-fi issue, I never had any problems(I have to admit, I was worried about this issue before I purchased UL30A-x5, but didn't happen to me). My friends do not have this problem on their unit, also. (i guess they have fixed it somehow or that is issue for UL30A-A2.

After a month of use, I'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase. The chiclet keyboard, performance and overall feel have exceeded my expectations. Bear in mind that I had tried an ACER ultralight and already knew I was willing to give up a built in DVD in exchange for lighter weight. I already had an external LG DVD writer that I used with my netbook, which is now gathering dust.  The screen is bright and vivid with outstanding contrast and excellent response. I have adapted to glossy, reflective screens and do not use it where glare would be a problem. Internet TV looks fine but darker DVD movies don't show well. The hardware can handle the video fine but the screen image is often too shadowy (not sure of the technical term for this). There is a built in utility that is designed to optimize the screen settings for different purposes but I have not experimented with it, since I rarely watch DVD's on my laptop. The build quality is good, though there are a couple of spots where the plastic gives a bit, as though the frame pieces did not mesh exactly. If this were an issue for me, I would have spent twice as much and bought a Lenovo. The touchpad has taken some getting used to, and it does respond to accidental thumb strikes when typing. I plan to try out the drivers mentioned in other reviews. I love the semigloss exterior, which does show fingerprint smudges but not as much a my wife's HP. When my co-workers saw it, they were uniformly impressed and compared it to the Mac Air. It's become a cliche, but my overall sense is that everything seems to \"just work\" -- the power button is right where I would have put it, the keyboard layout seems natural, there is no obvious bottleneck in doing ordinary things, the cool features are understated and don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves, and the balance seems just right when you pick it up with one hand.","Date":"January 24, 2010"}

I got mine a few days ago, and I can tell you it's as close to perfect as you will find in a laptop.  I was a netbook early adopter (EeePC 701, with a roomy 4 GB solid-state hard drive!), and was left unsatisfied by the small screen size (7\") and the severe lack of computing power.  Needless to say, the ASUS UL30A is a step up in terms of performance and features, and one that manages to keep the light weight and small form factor.First of all, the computer is beautiful: thin and polished.  However, I don't think it will turn heads the way the Dell Vostro v13 will.  I especially like the island keyboard and the brushed aluminum cover. And it's not just looks, this computer has a big hard drive, plenty of DDR3 memory, and a good Core 2 Duo processor.But what drew me towards this laptop was the impressive battery life.  Although I'm not getting the quoted 12 hours of battery life (more like 8 hours), I am very happy with being able to go through a day's work or a plane trip on one charge.  The Power4Gear software is a rarity: an OEM software that you'd want to keep.  The default settings are pretty good, and should probably work well for most people.There's a few things I would change, however.  I would prefer to have two mousepad buttons instead of one, and the button could be a bit thicker.  The power cord connector should pull out easily, such that in case someone trips over the cord the laptop doesn't come down crashing.  Finally, I would have liked dedicated volume buttons instead of the dedicated PgUp/PgDn ones.Overall, I think this computer provides a better value than its competitors (the Vostro v13, for example).  A beautiful screen, roomy hard drive, plenty of fast memory, long battery life, and the thin-and-light form factor for $650 shipped?  You won't find that anywhere else.","Date":"January 14, 2010"}

Unfortunately there were several drawbacks that made me ultimately return it.1. The keyboard key's kept jamming and making unnatural sounds.2. The deal breaker was here. My hard drive wouldn't stop making noises no matter what I did. It was very noticeable and loud compared to all my previous notebooks.3. Whenever I lifted up the notebook, it would suddenly start whining.4. The limited display view was also somewhat of a disappointment.Despite the faults, I was still fairly impressed with the notebook and had asked for a replacement.Unfortunately, the replacement I received had a dead pixel right in the middle so I ended up asking for a complete refund.Great service from Amazon as usual, but buying from Asus again is very iffy for me.","Date":"December 18, 2009"}

I'm constantly carrying this between home and school.2) Lengthy battery life: around 6-8 hours even if I'm simultaneously running statistical programming packages (e.g., SAS), surfing the internet, and playing music.3) More than enough CPU to smoothly run all of the above programs simultaneously and quietly.  Processor is still as fast as it was the day I received it.  A bit slower if I add Adobe Photoshop into the mix, but that's expected.4) Display brightness is perfect.  Everything looks extremely clear.5) Chiclet-style keyboard comfortable and easy to use6) The battery hasn't come loose like it had for some of the other reviewers, and I carry this around fairly often.7) Great support from both Amazon and Asus.8) Most importantly, NO technical problems thus far!Main cons:1) As already mentioned, the surfaces (especially the outside) are a fingerprint magnet.  Be sure to have a microfiber cloth with you at all times if you're bothered by this.2) The ASUS warranty system is a bit sketchy, as I just mailed a registration card into them and didn't receive any confirmation.  Though this may have changed by now.3) No optical disc drive, but I'll just buy an external for $50 if I really need one.4) The webcam, although sufficient for video chatting, is nothing to write home about.Overall, this is a fantastic laptop and I STRONGLY recommend it to anyone in the market for a high quality thin-and-light at a great price!","Date":"October 24, 2010"}

If you plan on watching any videos or playing ANY video games on it, the extra $100 is completely worth it.This laptop is incredibly light, the main reason for which is the lack of an optical drive.

I've owned it for a little over 10 months now, and it has worked great with two exceptions: three months in, one of the keys on the keyboard fell off. Getting it replaced was actually a bit of a nightmare, because ASUS wanted me to ship the laptop to them, which I just could not do on my schedule. They eventually sent me a new keyboard and the replacement process was fine, but there were several weeks where I had to type without a letter in place (although I found that a little sticky tape could go a long way). The only other problem I've had is that, for no reason, my hard drive crashed one day (about 9 months in). I managed to recover my important files, but I had to do a recovery to the entire computer and start fresh. The mouse is also not very good - I bought an external one and rarely use the touchpad.However, in general I have been very happy with the machine.

Not only that, Asus sold me faulty hardware and doesn't back up any information when you use the warranty. For some reason, they also have record that I bought my computer a year before I did and now they're giving me trouble for my warranty.

{"Title":"Great laptop--coming from a college student","Author":"Jenny","ReviewID":"R2HS2SO0J9Q1FT","Overall":"good","Content":"So, I was in quite the situation when I ruined my old, slow, 10 minute battery laptop by choking and spitting my drink all over its keyboard. I had to act fast and get myself a brand new laptop since I need one for basically everything I do in life. So the first thing I did was check out amazon to see what kind of laptops they had and their specs and prices. This laptop's description immediately caught my eye. Thin and light? 12 hour battery?! That would be amazing after the fat and heavy, 10 minute battery laptop I used to have. The price looked really good as well. But being the frugal shopper that I am, I decided not to act too quickly and go to my local Best Buy, Costco, and Fry's before I make any decision. Everything they had in the stores did not even compare to this laptop in my eyes. Yes, some computers had the new i3, i4, and i5 processors, and other spiffy specs, but that really did not mean too much to me. As a college student all I was looking for was something that was: 1) very portable, 2) long battery life-- have you any idea how irritating it is to find a darn outlet inside a large lecture hall? 3) ~13 inches--anything bigger is too bulky to carry around 4) affordable 5) any operating system other than Vista. This computer best fit my criteria, and after reading all the positive reviews about it, I decided to place the order.I just received my laptop yesterday, and I have to say. It's beautiful. The first thing I noticed when I took the computer out of its box was that it was very sleek looking, slim, and super light. Great! I open the laptop and I see a BUNCH of stickers and protective coverings. No problem, everything came off clean. The only thing I noticed was that the touch pad area had residual stickiness that made it very difficult to slide my finger across the pad. But the stickiness seemed to just vanish after using it a little, and it works great. I like how it isn't the traditional touch pad, but has little dots that sense your finger instead. Setup was pretty simple. I let it do its thing for about 10-15 minutes, then it asked me to make a username and password, and set up my internet connection and it was good to go. The keyboard is very nice to type on too. One of my friends pointed out that the design looked similar to that of a macbook. It comes pre-installed with a couple Asus programs that I probably would never use as well as some anti-virus program that I had never head of. But that was pretty easy to deal with. Uninstalling programs doesn't take a genius. So far everything has been running very smoothly, no issues to report yet.My only beef with this laptop is that it does not have a DVD drive, and I depended on my old laptop to burn DVDs and CDs as well as hook it up to my TV to watch movies. They don't really advertise this fact on the product description, so I was pretty sad about that. So I go back on Amazon and notice that a lot of the people who purchased this laptop also bought Asus's external DVD drive/recorder, so of course I had to take a look. It was just what I was missing, so I go ahead and buy that as well. Problem solved! I guess the lack of a DVD drive just a sacrifice we have to make in exchange for how light this laptop is.I actually took this laptop with me to work yesterday and my manager really liked it. He then called out a couple more of his staff to take a look. It was amusing to watch them all crowd around my computer and admire it. But anyway, all in all, if you are considering buying this laptop, I would say go for it. Especially if you have similar criteria to mine. Its a great laptop at a great price.","Date":"March 3, 2010"}

It is replacing my more capable, but heavier Dell 1505 (Core2, 3gb, 1440x900 15\" LCD).Pros: Thin, light, ~6-8 hours of real-time battery depending on usage, 2 year warranty, 1 year accidental damage warranty, portableNote: The battery in this model is the smaller 10 hour+ 4400mah 8-cell, not the 12 hour+ 5600mah 8-cell found in the more $$$ UL30a's.  Battery life is not the 12+ hour rating Amazon claims. Asus claims only 10+ hour on their website for this model.Cons: Battery life doesn't live up to Amazon's 12 hour claim, Asus bloatware slows Win7, creaky, cheap plastic construction (flexy palm rest), easily smudges (which transfers from palm rest to screen bezel), blue-ish screen, easily scruffed plastic (ironically, the cloth-like protector that comes as a separator between the screen and keyboard can scratch the screen bezel if used to wipe down the smudges), noisy possibly cheap HDD (I moved the computer once, slightly, while shutting down to hear the HDD clack and screech in protest).I'm normally not one to complain about cosmetics of a PC - heck, I have been lugging around a 6lb+ Inspiron 1505 for 3 years.  But I'm astounded at how crummy this otherwise eye-catching Asus can look after a few smudges and now some scratches.  I'm not abusive to my other electronics, so I don't like the way this computer is showing signs of what looks like heavy wear after just a few weeks use.Ok, so I sound down on this computer, but I'm not.  I'm keeping it.  It just didn't live up to the high praise and my subsequent expectations.  I think the first thing I'll do is to put an SSD in it so I have no worries about the possibly bad HDD, or injuring the HDD.It'll be a good companion on the road for years to come, but just not a replacement for my Dell.","Date":"March 28, 2010"}

The track pad takes some getting used to, but can be disabled and I just use a wireless mouse.However, I just can't get over the fact that this only have a 10/100 NIC in it.  Really?  It's great to be backwards compatible, but no Gb speeds?  Can't say that I would buy another because of this small but serious oversight by ASUS, just to save a few penny's to make the laptop.","Date":"October 13, 2010"}

(OCZ Vertex)All and all a great buy.Problem:- Before you buy it, make sure you look up the widespread problem with the intermittent wireless connections. more later.- It comes with bloadware and the backup cd creator software simply doesn't burn correctly with my external burner, so i have no way to reinstall windows without paying.- the clam shell does not open all the way up 180 degrees, which makes it quite inconvenient.- The edge is rough with plastic seams.Took me quite a lot of pain to read up on the wireless problems.There's a widespread problem with the wireless card dropping connections. I tested many settings and found that there's no problem with Linux, no problem if connecting to 801.11 b/g network but big problem with Windows 7 wireless N network. I got the badly named driver from Asus website which made it stop dropping network connection, but the connection is much slower than the same laptop running Linux, especially upload speed.i wish I knew of a way to drop the connection speed on the wireless driver to b/g only, which could possibly solve the problem.I might just get a half sized wireless driver from Intel and install it.","Date":"May 20, 2010"}

{"Title":"SKYPE LAPTOP","Author":"M. J. Cowdery","ReviewID":"RUR7U9MF34I4Y","Overall":"good","Content":"Ok I'm not going to repeat what everyone else is saying. this is a 5 star laptop in terms of value and performance.What I want to point out is that with 10-12 hours of battery life and a $629 price tag this might make (I haven't tried it out myself but would like to) an excellent skype laptop for those who have or need mobile broadband. Couple it with mobile broad band and bluetooth headphones/headset(with micro bluetooth adapter) and you might find a good way to save money on you cell phone bills (if mobile broadband is important/necessary to you).mobile broadband = $60/monthskype online number = $60/year (=$5/month)micro bluetooth adapter = $16+mifi battery extender (to extend the battery of your mifi modem) = $50-(minus)current cell phone bill($30 -$99/month)the drawbacks are that you'll have to carry your laptop in a bag or something everywhere you go (which I do anyway...) and if you need it for longer than 10 hours you would have to plug it in sometime or you'd be in trouble. You'd also have to learn how to handle the 5gb upload limit on mobile broadband which is pretty reasonable once you learn how to do it. Just don't play mmo's or use torrents and don't use youtube sparingly unless your in a hotspot and you should be well under the 5gb limit.Furthermore you should check out DUO touch which can turn you laptop into a tablet pc. it's actually only awkward looking but in someways better (definitely cheaper) than buying an actual tablet pc. you can turn you laptop upside down so that the screen is where your keybaord should be and manually invert the screen in control panel. Excellent for a thin and light like this. DUO = $120.I'll try these things and if they work well I'll update this review.","Date":"February 28, 2010"}

{"Title":"so many problems","Author":"Donald Clarke \"interested\"","ReviewID":"R1IYAELWO8K8X4","Overall":"bad","Content":"I just erased about 20 lines of problems; maybe such an occurrence is another problem (that I also had with my ACER netbook that I replaced): accidental deletions by chance encounters with the mousepad.  The mousepad is sticky: the fingers don't slide easily (my ACER netbook worked great).  When speaking with an ASUS tec rep, I turned the laptop over to read the model number for him and a tic-tic-tic... sounded for 15 seconds (maybe a fan?).  He didn't know what it might have been.  I bought a security cable only to find out that the ASUS hole is too small for the cable size I bought (the only size I could find).  When I do find a small diameter cable I worry that it will be hard to manage because it is very close to the power input plug.  The user manual that came with the laptop is a few pages only.  I tried to set up Speech Recognition, but it couldn't hear any sound.  I phoned a tec rep to ask where the builtin microphone is and after literally being on hold for almost 15 minutes while he looked for the location, I hung up and rephoned.  This rep, after some time, located the pinhole mike and we established that it was working (but not enough for Speech Recog).  He also told me how to download the full manual.  Before I found out a regular manual exists, I phoned tec support to find out what the 4 symbols mean that are just below the mousebar; another 5 minutes to determine what they represent.  I spoke with 3 men and all had accents very hard to understand (located in Freemont CA) (but I have lost some hearing, so maybe that was the problem); one woman was easy to understand.  Yesterday (I've had the laptop 2 days) the screen went crazy; the battery indicator said 2 hours+ remained, but when I plugged in the power the screen returned to normal.  For a 64 bit dual core, it seems slow, but that could be an Internet problem.  I am no expert with laptops, and I wish ASUS would make things easier for us novices.  I would have returned the laptop but I leave the country in 2 days.","Date":"April 28, 2010"}

{"Title":"A Solid Machine","Author":"Kevin Seeley","ReviewID":"R1TGBIFDF77X49","Overall":"good","Content":"It is important to note that I am reviewing the s6992 model ($899). The only real differences that I have noticed between this model and the more expensive model is the lack of a blu-ray drive and that there is no keyboard back-lighting. If these are important to you, then you should definitely get the most expensive model ($1099).I purchased this laptop about a week ago, through tiger direct, for college use after my ASUS had failed (major hardware issues). So far, I am very impressed. There are better lengthy reviews on this model already (see Mad B's for example), so I shall keep this brief.Pros: - Gaming: I am not an avid gamer, but it was important to me that my new rig could handle any new games that I would want to throw at it. To be clear, games on this machine run beautifully. The 230M is a true performer, and I had no problem playing Team Fortress 2 and  Left 4 Dead 2 (demo) on this machine at max settings. I am confident that you would be able to play more demanding games with no problems. - Windows 7 : Loving it so far. I have had zero compatibility problems with my favorite programs, and if you are buying a new laptop, you may as well get one with the latest OS. - Full Keyboard : Just a nice feature to have, really. - Speakers : Great for just listening to music or watching a movie. These speakers are plenty loud and aren't tinny like most laptop speakers.  (NOTE: There have been some reported problems with these speakers just not working suddenly. Before you assume it is a driver issue, turn off the laptop, take out the battery, and reinsert. This inexplicably seems to fix the problem. This has only happened to me once, but is a common issue with the A505 series.)Cons: - Battery Life : About 2 to 2.5 hours on a low power setting. If you are gaming, forget it. It is important to know this going in. If you don't like to have your laptop plugged into the wall most of the time, then you will want to look into some other options. If you are like me, and this is more of a desktop replacement, then no issue. - Finger Prints! : Don't get me wrong, this laptop is very attractive...just pre-use. I am constantly wiping this thing down with a micro-fiber cloth after use, to keep it shiny. Not really that big of a deal though.Overall, I'd give this a 9/10. If you can forgive the battery life and deal with the finger prints, you can enjoy a laptop that can handle itself pretty darn well.","Date":"November 9, 2009"}
{"Title":"Toshiba Satellite A505-S6992 - good for consumers, 'OK' for the budget conscious technophile","Author":"IT-Guru","ReviewID":"R1X1B8X7MPVZ3P","Overall":"good","Content":"I own this notebook for the past 4 weeks, and used it hard since then. I bought it at FRYS for 750 USD; at that price it's a good notebook, but at the MSRP of 900 USD it's merely average.The good:- 64bit edition of Windows 7- Bright LED Screen- ECOnomy mode- 4 GB of faster DDR3 RAM- 500 GB Harddrive- Nvidia Geforce GT230M videocard- Higher End Multimedia options & connectivity (Firewire, HDMI, eSATA)- sensitive WI-FI card with Draft N protocol- in-built Accelerometer that 'protects' the harddrive better versus data-loss when the netbook gets dropped or bumped- slot-loading DVD-burner - no accidentally breaking-off the DVD-tray- decent Audio-speaker that actually can be loud and do not loose their sound quality; to top it off, the Speakers are housed in their own vibration-padded casing.- OPTIONAL a 12-cell battery can be purchased separately at Toshiba, which becomes a necessity if you're on the go a lot.The bad- Battery Life - a standard 6-cell Battery- Battery Life (again - why? because the battery is dead after 1 hour when watching a movie, or playing a AAA-game)- slow harddrive (takes forever to boot-up from 'cold' state)- no Bluetooth- no inbuilt keyboard back light (so you can see and type in the 'dark')- comes pre-installed with a lot of \"shovel-ware\" (that is; installed software that's not needed because windows7 has them already integrated) that causes to prolong the boot-up process tremendously.- Toshiba deviating from the MXM-standard (Mobile PCI-Express Module) for mobile video-cards - that means, you cannot easily replace the 3D-video-card against a better/faster one, down the road, to prolong the value of your notebook- in-built Processor does NOT support Intel's VT - The ability to run hardware support for Virtual Machines (i.e. Windows XP Mode in Windows 7 Professional & Ultimate)Quintessence:It's a decent system, if you get it for cheaper (as I did) than the MSRP. the Video-card is, as of time of writing, considered a \"high performance\" model, compared what's currently out there for laptops. The lack of BluRay drive I consider not a problem, since the 16-inch screen-size does not really require Hi-Def resolution. Speakers have a good sound, compared to other notebooks out there. What bugs me most is the Battery-Life, it's okay for \"web surfing & word processing\" (about 2 hours, 2.5 hours with the ECO-mode active), but if you're watching movies or playing AAA-rated games, the battery is dead in ~1 hour or less. It's highly recommended to purchase the optional 12-cell battery. What i miss the most - other than the battery life - is integrated Bluetooth (for wireless stereo headsets) and the keyboard not being back-lit (for better typing in low-light/dark). It needs to be noted that the Laptop has eSATA and HDMI connectivity, for high data-rate transfers with external harddrives or other devices, and for Hi-Def audo/video connectivity. the eSATA-port is also an USB-port at the same time, which allows to charge external devices (cellphones, MP3 players and such) while the notebook is in \"sleep mode\", but that is only feasible when the optional 12-cell battery is used/installed.What upsets me the most is that Toshiba deviates from the MXM industry standard of mobile video cards, which would allow to replace the video-card against a newer one to make the Notebook last longer in value - especially if you're a avid computer gamer. But for 90% of all consumers out there this is usually not much of concern.According to a recent survey, Toshiba and ASUS notebooks are currently the longest lasting one, whereas DELL and Hewlett-Packard notebooks have the shortest life cycles; which is also a reason why i bought this notebook.It's worth four stars at my purchase price, but only three stars at MSRP.Verdict:Buy it, if you get it for cheaper than the MSRP","Date":"December 22, 2009"}
{"Title":"Awesome Laptop All Around","Author":"mrooobaa","ReviewID":"R3USJVECTMO27T","Overall":"good","Content":"It's too bad Toshiba stopped making this laptop, because it's an excellent laptop. I'm a full time student who likes to do gaming on the side, and this works perfectly. The laptop has a good, solid feel, and it also isn't too heavy.For starters, this laptop has a TON of features. Firewire 400, eSATA, 4 USB 2.0 ports, VGA out, HDMI out (can easily be converted to DVI if needed), and much more. The applications it comes with are also pretty useful. It has one app that can detect whether the laptop is in motion or not. When it detects motion, it takes the reading head off the HDD, so if it's dropped or whatever, the head won't crash into the HDD, and there will be a smaller chance of the laptop getting damaged. I'm wondering why it has a 56k/fax modem, but it does, so if you need it, this is one of the few laptops that has it built in. They should have put in Bluetooth, but there's some tiny adapters out there, so it's not a big flaw. The keyboard has an excellent feel to it, and it even has a number pad on the side (without having to use \"Fn\" keys). The touch pad for the mouse works well, but it would have been nice to have features like multi-touch for doing two-finger scrolling. The screen resolution is a bit low at 1376x768, but it manages to work. Overall, it's a decent looking display, but 1600x900 would have been more appropriate. The other really, really nice feature of this laptop is the 1GB GDDR3 GT230M video chip. It has its own memory and processor, so it runs games quite well. I was able to max out Left 4 Dead with zero lag. 512MB probably would have sufficed, but if you're using the HDMI to output it to a 1080p display, the entire 1GB will come in handy. The Core 2 Duo CPU is also fast enough for any game, and it will do a great job at any number crunching you can give it. The DDR3 memory also saves a little bit of power compared to DDR2 memory.My only serious complaint about the laptop is the battery life. If you need it to last longer than 2-3 hours, you must use the eco mode. It works pretty well in eco mode, but it's seriously under-clocked (the CPU is run at a slower speed to save battery life), so no serious gaming is possible with it on. It's not a bad idea to pick up a larger battery for this laptop.Overall, it's a solid laptop, and I'm quite happy I bought it. This is exactly what I needed for school, and I'm disappointed Toshiba stopped making it (probably to replace the CPU with an i3 or an i5, but we'll see).Pros:-Eco mode gives ~+1 hour battery life-DDR3 memory saves some battery-CPU is plenty for just about anything you would want to do on a laptop-Dedicated Video card handles all games that are currently out on the market-Nice keyboard-eSATA, Firewire, S/PDIF out, and plenty of USB ports-HDMI out-Solid feeling laptop-HDD monitor is a great add-onCons:-Battery life is a little short, even with eco mode-Screen resolution is a bit low at 1376x768, would've preferred at least 1600x900-No integrated Bluetooth-Camera/mic quality isn't great-No multi-touch for the mouse pad","Date":"September 11, 2010"}

You should never pay more than $900 anyway...PLEASE NOTE !!!! Another Toshiba machine with a higher screen resolution is available at the same price, it's only inconvenience is being bulky and heavy (model: P500-ST68X1), so if you really look for a desktop replacement and mobility is not so important for you, you should think about the P500-ST68X1Back to this machine, regarding to the pros, I think you can get most of it from the machine specs:1. 500GB HDD, 4GB DDR3... Should keep you running for at least 2 years2. 16\" True Brite display... Pictures and movies Looks wonderful with TrueBrite3. Dedicated NVidia graphics memory rather that a shared memory Intel chipset... Should be very important for gamers. I havent tried it yet with gaming, but I think it will work great4. Windows 7 Home Premium: Haven t spent much yet testing it, but it looks more appealing that the stupid Vista... I was totally against the idea of migrating to Vista (after testing it with one of the workstations at work), however, Windows 7 looks much more mature to me than Vista... So, probably I'll keep it and wont downgrade the machine to XPOf course there are some cons, I agree with all described in other reviews, and I like to add the following:1. Be careful, screen resolution is only 1366x768... It looks great with movies and pictures, but if you like working at super high resolutions and you love to read tiny fonts (like me), this screen might be a bit disappointing for youMy other laptop is a Lenovo W500, offering a resolution of 1920x1200... So I miss the feeling of having this global view for my applicationsHowever to be honest, Truebrite still appears to be more vivid than Lenovo's2. Be careful, the 2 memory slots are already used, so you can only upgrade the laptop memory by replacing installed chips3. Be careful, 16\" laptops will probably not fit in 15.4\" cases, so you'll probably need to buy a new laptop case for this machine4. I totally agree that the machine comes loaded with lots of unnecessary software... I've already uninstalled lots of that5. I totally agree that the laptop finish although it appears very elegant, it's still very annoying when it comes to finger prints (they occur very easily, look very ugly, and you'll suffer to remove it)6. Socket loading CD-ROM, it looks fancy, but I feel it's somehow fragile (just a feeling)7. I still dont feel conformable with the touchpad (maybe it's a matter of time, but so far I cant have good control of it, even after changing its settings several times)Another important piece of info, according to Windows 7, this machine has an overall Windows Experience Index of 5.7, which is fair enoughConclusion:Good machine for all purposes, I don't regret buying it at all, it's just that you need to understand all cons very well and accept them, then probably you'll see that this is the best machine you can get within this price range if you look for mobility and power","Date":"December 30, 2009"}

Most of the time it just sits on my room, almost never took it out.I called Toshiba and they said that it's not covered under warranty. They're basically giving me the finger for their own incompetencies creating a reliable hardware.I have had a Dell laptop (supposedly inferior to Toshiba brand) for 5 years and NEVER even once had to send it in. The reason I switched to Toshiba is because I thought Toshiba has better quality, and the Dell laptop hardware is getting too outdated for today's software performance (it's a 5 year laptop.. what do you expect?).This would be the last time I'm getting laptop from Toshiba (had a DVD player and portable HDD from Toshiba.. works fine).","Date":"May 6, 2010"}

When I mentioned in my last call that Toshiba Executives need to know how their customers are being treated and that I CANNOT recommend their computers to anyone in good conscience, I was told \"suit yourself.\" To give you an idea of ALL the headaches I have undergone since I bought my computer....here is a short list:1) My computer came with Windows Vista and kept crashing. Toshiba's Tech. people said that it was due to \"glitches\" with the operating system and said that I would have to back up my data and re-install the OS. Remember people, this is a NEW computer that is supposedly under warranty! Their Tech. people also had the nerve to tell me that they \"did not have the training\" to tell me how to back up my data and once I took it to Best Buy and PAID to have my data backed up, then they could tell me how to reload the OS!2)Also, when I purchased the computer, there was a catalog insert in the Toshiba packaging that offered a 3-year extended warranty for 15% off. However, when I called Toshiba to buy the warranty, AGAIN, their Customer NON-Service people quoted me a price that was almost $100 more than the price in the catalog and told me that they did not know anything about the reduced price offered to purchasers of new Toshiba computers. When I told them that the catalog was sent INSIDE the Toshiba computer box that was sent to me from Amazon.com, they told me that I would need to \"find a Kinkos and fax a copy of the catalog\" to them \"for review\" and they will \"see if the management will honor it\"!!!!!!!!!3)Finally, to add insult to injury -- when I purchased this computer, I was offered a \"FREE\" upgrade to Windows 7, but when I went online I found out that I had to PAY almost $12 for \"shipping and handling\". Okay, I swallowed that insult, but THEN after 25 minutes entering all the order info. the Toshiba site would not allow me to enter in my Credit Card number to pay for the thing. When I called their Customer Service people, they had NO CLUE what to tell me. After 45 MINUTES -- and after talking with 4 different people -- they FINALLY transferred me to a \"Manager\" who ALSO had NO idea what to do and said that \"I guess the website must be having problems, so try again later\"!!!Look, all I can say to anyone who wants to buy a Toshiba is BUYER BEWARE. Their Tech. people have NO CLUE, their Customer Service is INEPT and their Management is DISGUSTINGLY RUDE!!! Dealing with Toshiba is a NIGHTMARE! Consider yourselves warned!","Date":"December 1, 2009"}
{"Title":"my first laptop","Author":"D. White","ReviewID":"R5HJLXMIUHNB2","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first laptop.  I was shopping on black Friday, have heard great things about Toshiba laptops, and they had this one for 499.00 so I said what the heck and got it!  I also ordered a wireless router.  A few days later the box came and I could not be happier.  The best thing about is the the display.  It is very sharp, bright, and clear.  The keyboard is nice as well.  I can't stand the touchpad, but I think that's a common problem with all laptops.  I immediately went out and bought a wireless mouse to use with it.  The sound is not great either, but again, I think that's common with laptops. It seems pretty sturdy, and runs cool.  It does not get hot, and the fan doesn't even run when the ambient temp is around 65 degrees.  Setting up the wireless network was a breeze, and when I started up the laptop, it found the signal immediately, and never loses it.  The computer is very fast and I have not had one problem.  Very satisfied..and wow what a great price I got--this is a well equipped laptop.","Date":"December 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"Wish it had an HDMI output","Author":"D. Sheehan","ReviewID":"R39LXIR3LOLQSH","Overall":"good","Content":"I had looked for a while for a laptop after my desktop died and the Toshiba L505 series was one of my finalists. It has not disappointed me and at the price ($499) for the specs (4g ram/500g HD)it has been the a great machine.One plus with this machine is that it came with very little \"bloatware\"- Norton trial, Microsoft Office 2007 trial, and some games. So, if you buy this machine at a \"Box Store\" don't let them con you into optimization for an extra $50-$100, you can do recovery disks and bloatware removal on your own.The only downside is I really wish it had an HDMI output for streaming movies to my flat screen from places like Amazon, but the VGA or USB output will have to suffice.No HDMI is only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, other machines in this range offer it and hope Toshiba will soon.","Date":"December 9, 2009"}

{"Title":"Another terrific Toshiba!","Author":"Carolina Magnolia","ReviewID":"R1CN8VQQSTEC31","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my 3rd laptop, 2nd Toshiba.  I got one of these on Black Friday for my son, and just ordered another for myself. I love Win 7! There is very little preloaded crap to remove and it is super fast. Having the numeric keypad on the side and an amazing screen add to its sheer awesomeness.  The touchpad is ultra cool.  I must agree with other reviewers that the sound is lacking, but I did not purchase the laptop to be my primary music player so I still gave it 5 stars. I was shocked when I first closed the laptop, being used to ones that latch. This one doesn't latch and the tension hinge (which keeps it closed in lieu of a latch) wants to slam shut in the last few inches, whereas those that latch have to be pushed all the way closed.  It survived that rough close and my 1st Toshiba, four months old and running great for my college student, survived a 3 foot drop onto carpet.  If a Toshiba can survive me, it has my loyalty.","Date":"December 22, 2009"}
{"Title":"Very good, if not great","Author":"J. West","ReviewID":"R39JPYG42JK3RF","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this machine 2 weeks ago to replace an old personal eMachines laptop, I use an IBM Thinkpad for work. This computer stacks up nicely compared to all the other laptops I've used. First, the screen is very bright and vivid. I love the number pad, it's great not having to hunt and peck for the numbers across the top of the keys. Without a doubt, the memory and RAM are great at this price point. Unfortunately, I didn't get the great deal some others did, but even at $579, it's still a good value. I've already loaded up my iTunes and other applications and it runs smoothly and quickly. It was a breeze to set up.The only draw back is the touch pad, as others have mentioned. When I bought it, I'd read some reviews that pointed to the frustrations this thing caused, but I figured people were just being picky. They weren't - it stinks. First it's a bit hard to see, but that's not such a big deal. The real issue is the application. I've gone in and adjusted the settings every which way possible, I can't get it to function as I want. I ultimately turned off the tapping function (way too sensitive at every setting) and I'm still not happy. I find myself using the pad and it randomly adjusts the zoom level of the screen. I've no doubt that this issue can be resolved with some setting, but I can't find it.To summarize, the touchpad is bad enough to take away 1 star, but the pros far outweigh this con, especially if you use an external mouse. Do your research, you probably won't find a machine with this much to offer at a similar price point.","Date":"December 28, 2009"}

I like the desktop wallpaper option that allows you to make it a slideshow of as many pics as you want in different time intervals. this computer boots in mere seconds which is awesome compared to some computers that take up to 10 minutes in some cases like my moms dell desktop which is so underpowered its crazy. she bought it on a home shopping network channel. trust me thats a bad idea on buying computers. anyway my computer is very fast and i like windows 7. its also HD so you can watch movies online or HD youtube videos that are available in HD actually in HD. only one complaint. when watching a streaming movie on DIVX it does have an issue with not completely stretching all the way to full screen on DIVX windowed mode when connected to a widescreen television. at least the one tv that i tried it on. thats not a huge complaint though as I dont usually use this computer for movie watching connected to a tv. I will be using it as my mobile internet laptop for work and elsewhere on the go. I also will be upgrading this computer to 8 gigs of ram although it really doesnt need it as it really is a fast computer but hey its going to get even faster. I love that it can be upgraded to 8 gigs.UPDATE: its only been two or 3 weeks now but now my internal speakers do not work. I redownloaded the sound driver from toshiba but they still do not work. the headphone jack works and external speakers will work to but it sucks that the internal speakers that are on this computer decided to stop working so quickly. I went online and it is an issue with Toshiba laptops.","Date":"January 23, 2010"}

I really like the numberpad.  It connected to my system without any problems. So far, I have nothing to report other than a very good product for a fair price.  Actually Battery life is very acurately estimated!  This is a true exception to the rule with laptops I have used in the past.  They will state x number of hours of battery life on a charge and normally last about half of that time.  This Toshiba states 2 hours and twenty five minutes, but it actually lasts that long!!  It has been my experience that others advertise 4 hours and last less than 2.I see this product rating a 5 after I have had it longer.

{"Title":"Great laptop","Author":"K. Jones \"fly guy\"","ReviewID":"R3SZFF61V6B3OC","Overall":"good","Content":"After months of contemplating to purchase a new laptop to replace my old Dell latitude D600 I finally pulled the trigger. I purchased this one 3 days before Thanksgiving from Amazon. The initial purchase price was $579.99. Before it even arrived I went back to review my purchase the day after Thanksgiving and the price was now $499.99! Being a bit peeved that I just paid $80.00 more for the exact same laptop 3 days earlier I wrote and requested a refund of the difference. Amazon wrote me back and tried to make me feel guilty by saying they don't have a price guarantee but since it was just 3 days that they would go ahead and refund the difference, which they did and of which I really appreciated. The first laptop arrived and died over night! I contacted Toshiba to try and figure out why Windows would not start and was instructed to send it back. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent a replacement.So far this laptop has been working flawlessly.  The Windows 7 is lightning fast compared to XP. It boots right up from a cold start and shuts down fast. The wireless antenna picks up connections from all over the neighborhood. Connecting to my wireless service was a snap. The battery that came with the machine was a bit weak. It didn't seem to last very long so I purchased a 9 hour battery direct from Toshiba which holds a charge for a long time. The 9 hour battery is rather big and bulky but it beats dragging around a cord. The only thing I am not too thrilled about is the speakers. They seem rather puny, I can hardly hear them. Overall, this machine and Windows 7 is a huge upgrade for me. If it lasts half as lond as the Dell did I will be happy.I would like to add that my experience with Amazon has been outstanding with this purchase. No hassles whatsoever.","Date":"January 3, 2010"}

{"Title":"WARNING, read this before buying a toshiba","Author":"N. Ryan","ReviewID":"RBBYLMGZ6D2FT","Overall":"bad","Content":"Think twice before buying any product from toshiba.  I bought a laptop from them this summer, and within 3 months, it stopped powering on.  Per Toshiba's warranty, you MUST send it in to their \"repair depot\".  You cannot get it fixed locally unless you want to pay for it yourself.They promise a 7-10 day turn around, but it has now been at their \"repair depot\" for 10 weeks.  The \"repair depot\" has diagnosed the problem 3 times so far, and each time it waits on a part for an average of 2-3 weeks. If all the toshibas in the country come to a few centralized locations, wouldn't you have the parts in stock? Customer service is a call center in India where they read from a script and they are utterly worthless. You can call their \"repair depot\" directly but you will spend a minimum of an hour on hold.  They refuse to replace the computer or offer a refund. Their only response is \"you just have to wait\".  Their \"case managers\" say the exact same thing.This is not an isolated incident.  Toshiba's laptop forums are full of similar stories. Please save yourself the trouble and buy another brand instead.","Date":"February 15, 2010"}
{"Title":"Crash-tastic","Author":"SXM132","ReviewID":"R1Z7JTJO6QCVCR","Overall":"bad","Content":"I got this laptop in the summer of 2010 for college. It was good for maybe a year, but as of late it's been crashing non-stop and depleting itself of battery in less than an hour. Its main issue is video. If you're thinking of watching HD youtube or just simply anything of finer quality, don't even THINK about getting this product. It freezes, turns black, and reboots with a green screen over the thing you intended to watch with a warning message. This flaw has been present since the laptop was fresh out of the packaging. Even if the video is not HD, or played on WMP, it will has a significant amount of lag and force you to watch things at 50%.If you like making videos yourself, don't get this product. I have Sony Vegas 8.0 installed on it, and it won't get as far as an 8 second render time before flashing a message that the system doesn't have enough memory and crashes. This is when I have 223 GB free of an 287 GB drive.There are also technical things that have been disappointing. One of the USB ports has stopped responding. The sound quality is tinny, and barely audible at its highest volume without headphones. The paint on the left click has completely worn off and looks hideous, and both clickers and touchpad have gone completely disoriented in the past to where you couldn't use them. The battery will only last you a little less than two years. The glossy screen also causes bad glaring.Its redeeming quality is that it gets the basic job done, which is writing and looking at stuff of the internet. Its gaming capacity is poor, and its video capacity is even poorer. If you're someone dependent on digital media like me you're better off tossing this thing out a window. If you're a digital artist, DO NOT buy this product.","Date":"May 1, 2012"}

Nelson","ReviewID":"R3UDUYHTVLUYPC","Overall":"good","Content":"This is our third Toshiba laptop and, mostly, I love it; although I do long for the Harmon Kardon speakers which were in our prior two laptops.Our first Toshiba laptop, purchased July 2005, was husband's work computer for almost five years and the computer was subjected to heavy, every day use (mostly AutoCAD) and lots of travel.  It died January 2010.Our second was purchased July 2006 and was lightly used as my home computer until Jan 2010, when it became my husband's work computer (needed XP).  It is still doing quite well, especially considering it's over 4 years old.This being our third Toshiba, we were expecting it to be reliable and of good quality and are not disappointed.  It has given no problems during the 9 months we've used it.  The only downside is the speakers - they are so quite!  I have googled solutions and work-arounds to amp them up, but they remain noticably quieter than we prefer.  We are fairly quiet people and would set a computer in one corner of a room and play I-tunes, which would softly permeate the first floor of our house.  On this computer - sounds are barely audible in one room.  I sometimes watch a movie while going to sleep (alone in a quiet room) and will often catch myself 'turning up' the sound - after it had already been set as loud as possible.  Next laptop will have Harmon Kardon speakers.Although sound is important, this factor has been the only downside of this laptop.  I really enjoy using Windows 7, having a ton of memory and having a super fast start-up/shut-down.  The laptop's durability surprised me recently when we were puppy-sitting, puppy accidentally popped off 3 key tiles.  I figured they were ruined, but after studying them for a second, all 3 perfectly snapped right back on.We made a great decision in buying this laptop and hope we are able to use it for many more years.","Date":"October 26, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great for all-in-one Laptop, but don't count on the speakers","Author":"L. Bravim","ReviewID":"RL17K66VIE7M0","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my second Toshiba Satellite laptop, the first was purchased 4 years ago and came with Windows XP. I bought another not because of any major problems with the old one, but simply to have Windows 7 on a nice, new machine. Toshiba does a great job in the mid-range laptop market. It's lighter than I expected, came with an expanded keyboard and a wide screen perfect for movie watching. While the Satellite handles video well, comes with a built-in microphone and webcam--sound is a major issue. If you like to use your laptop as a music player, definitely invest in some speakers because the ones in the machine are inaudible from a different room or with even the slightest background noise. Aside from the sound issue (common to many laptops), I found nothing to fault in the Satellite. Windows 7 is a definite improvement over XP and the screen is capable of high-resolution video. Battery life is shortened due to the size of the screen and computing power. I can go over two hours without a charge, more in economy mode. Students who plan on taking this to class may be better off with a more portable Toshiba model that includes a long-lasting battery. Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase and confidant in its lasting another four years.","Date":"January 28, 2010"}

Amazon was great about that..so far.I got a second  laptop and the wireless works about half of the time.  Tech support when I got them suggested the wireless was an issue but then why does it work sometimes?  I will likely send this one back as and will likely get another brand.

Only major issue during that time was the keyboard (keys stick, skip when typing).  But now, only 3.5 years after I purchased it, the battery needs replacing and worst of all the hard drive disk has completely failed.  Got the HDD failure warning late one night, the next morning the laptop died.  No chance for data backup so the next option is expensive data recovery.  I expect the HDD to last longer.  My old Dell which is almost 10 years old still works.  Probably won't buy a Toshiba in the future.","Date":"September 18, 2013"}

I've owned other laptops and desktops over the years, and this has been, by far, the most dependable computer I have ever had! I have absolutely no complaints about the computer. I do, however, have an issue with Microsoft. Why must their operating system constantly download updates? Why must they clutter up my computer with crap that slows down the startup time? When I first received this computer, it would be up and running 20-30 seconds after I turned it on. Now it takes a few minutes....and if Microsoft decides it wants to push updates, which happens a few times a week, I can expect that I won't be able to use the computer for 15 minutes or more! If anybody important from Microsoft ever reads this review, I suggest you make changes before you lose everybody to Apple or Google.","Date":"December 27, 2012"}

{"Title":"The more I use it, the more I love it","Author":"Spinner","ReviewID":"R30UPUPWREWKW","Overall":"good","Content":"I needed to update my home computer and the main decision I had to make was whether I wanted a new desktop, an all in one, or a laptop.  I decided on a laptop (and in particular this laptop) for several reasons. The first reason was the freedom a laptop offers. This beats both the desktop and the all in one.The second reason was the ability to connect it to my television. Again this beats both the desktop and the all in one. Just so you know, my wife doesn't consider a desktop to be suitable dcor for the living room.These positives outweighed the negatives. For one thing with a laptop, all your eggs are in a basket that could be dropped or forgotten on the subway. Also, if the LCD screen goes bad you're likely to drop some serious cash on replacing it.The biggest negative I feel toward laptops is the keyboard and touchpad. The laptops I occasionally use at work have scrunched up keys, and no number keypad. Also, the touchpads need to have their itches scratched in just the right way or they don't move the cursor the way you want them to.In deed, the first step in choosing this Toshiba was going to the big box store and practicing typing on all the models with number keypads. I made the least number of typing errors with the Toshiba. After that, I looked at the features and the price. After that, I read through the reviews and finally, I decided to buy it from Amazon.After using this laptop for nearly a month, I'd have to say the more I use it, the more I love it. I do have minor annoyances with the touchpad. Probably every laptop has this issue and I guess I could mess around with the sensitivity and such, but it's not such a big deal to me.  It's really cool to watch a movie instantly on my laptop or hook up a VGA cable and watch it on my flat screen TV.The last little nick I want to mention is the fact that when I first got online with this laptop, I noticed it slowed down and eventually stopped working. I shut down the computer and immediately saw the problem. There were 10 Windows updates! I could not (and dared not) stop the installation process. The first 4 updates took nearly an hour to install; the rest took about 20 minutes. I couldn't use my computer for nearly an hour and half. It's a bummer when you have a new toy and Mr. Softy doesn't let you play with it.I struggled with the decision to give this laptop 4 stars instead of 5. I truly love this machine, and I highly recommend it. The minor annoyances of the touchpad and a batch of updates for Windows are certainly not unique to this machine, none the less, they do detract from an otherwise stellar machine.","Date":"March 3, 2010"}

{"Title":"Good laptop, but hard drive failed prematurely, Toshiba refuses to help","Author":"Z. Young \"Zachy Boy\"","ReviewID":"R25R6GT5M707X0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good laptop, good features. Runs fast, nothing to complain about. The only issue with this laptop was the hard drive prematurely failing. Within 1 year, the pc started displaying bizarre behavior, much like random slow downs for extended periods of time among other uncommon events. After talking to technical support about this laptop behavior, they recommended I do a full reformat with the recovery discs. Having used recovery discs to do a full reformat and reinstall of Windows 7, the computer again behaved properly. Some short months after this fresh complete reformat, Windows started to display a message in the system icon area regarding hard drive failure probability. I thought this was an insignificant event and thought it was just Windows being over zealous with reporting errors and failures.After receiving these hard drive error messages for a short time, I decided to use Windows built in error checking tool and used the recover bad sectors and fix system errors options. Still having error messages pop up regarding hard drive failure, I decided to do use the error checking tool a few more times over the next month or so as this was all I could think of.Starting up the laptop one day, it suddenly does not want to boot into Windows. It displays an error message after posting, but before completing the first Windows animation. The laptop no longer boots into windows at all after these events. In the error message, it displays options to discover exactly what was wrong with the pc, I go through the process and among the mumbo jumbo as some say, the conclusion it states as the root of the problem is a Bad Hard Drive Disk.After doing this test multiple times and getting exactly the same message and conclusion. I decided to contact Toshiba again. At first contact, they decided to move my issue up to their Case Manager as they call them. They said I would receive a call back within 3 business days. Four business days roll by and I call them back, after discussing the issue with them they decide to tell me that they don't know what caused it, it could have been my fault, and they chose not to do anything about it, even after me politely discussing them what option I might have. Not even me sending it in to them so they can diagnose it at the least, nothing whatsoever.The hard drive failed within 21 months from the date of purchase, I bought this for my parents and all it does is sit on a table not being used all that much.The most disappointing thing about this encounter with Toshiba is the fact that not only did they refuse to offer any possible diagnosing whatsoever, but back around 1990, Toshiba Corp was sued in a lawsuit involving $2 Billion dollars regarding their knowledge of selling faulty equipment, which involves laptops as well. This information was put in the news by the New York Times as well as others. From my experience with them, they were very unsympathetic.The hard drive it came with was a Toshiba brand hard drive 500GB, I had replaced it with a smaller 250GB Western Digital model as that was one of the cheapest I could find at Best Buy. This unnecessary repair had cost me $60 out of my pocket for a defect Toshiba refuses to even consider offering any help whatsoever. I now understand why Toshiba was sued for $2 Billion dollars, I wouldn't expect them to care for their customers anymore after that kind of loss. Thanks Toshiba.","Date":"December 15, 2011"}

I do considerable mods and can get myself in trouble, so my experience may not be the norm.  It does come loaded with a few \"trial\" and junk programs but not that many in comparison with Dell consumer versions for example.The Win7 64 bit operating system, although it is just an overlay of Vista, may still be an issue to you if all your software is designed for 32 bit.  I ran into this with my anti-virus program.My wife loves it to date.

{"Title":"A great product with a trade-off","Author":"A. Mathurin","ReviewID":"R17CSXD76DJ6M4","Overall":"good","Content":"While searching for the ideal laptop for myself, I found that all laptops seem to have huge trade-offs. This one is no exception. I chose it because it packed a relatively fast CPU and a decent graphics card into a very portable PC. Every other laptop I found with discrete graphics was a lot heavier, and most were pricier. The trade-off here (as with all laptops that have fast CPU's and discrete graphics) is that battery life is far from impressive. Unfortunately, there is no 9-cell (more powerful) battery available. Based on the location of the battery on the bottom of the laptop, I don't think there ever will a more powerful (and larger) option.Performance on this is great. Windows 7 is extremely responsive, audio production software runs smoothly, and game performance is even better than I expected - Dragon Age Origins looks beautiful at the screen's max resolution with most graphics settings somewhere between medium and high. I haven't tried editing video yet, but based on what I've seen so far, I don't expect any performance issues. If you're just planning to browse the web and work on spreadsheets, documents, etc. this may be overkill for you. You would probably have no problems on a cheaper machine with a slower CPU, without discrete graphics, and with longer battery life.Speaking of battery life, it is pretty short, but I find it to be usable. Asus added a dedicated button for switching power profiles. Switching to battery-saving mode gives a significant boost over high-performance and entertainment modes. I haven't done extensive testing, but it seems that battery-saving mode will get you 4-5 hours of web browsing and other light work, while entertainment mode might let you watch one movie before you need to search for an outlet. Depending on how and where you expect to use your laptop, this may or may not be a problem. In high-performance mode, hot air blows out of the right side, but the bottom doesn't get hot enough to burn laps.In response to other feedback I've seen:- It's been said that the touch-pad buttons are stiff. I don't find this to be the case at all. They seem quite comfortable to me, my girlfriend, and my mother.- Another reviewer mentioned having issues using the touch-pad scroll. The part about scrolling not stopping without an extra touch is a non-issue. This an intentional behavior that can be changed or turned off in settings. However, the part about having to hit the line is a very real issue. The problem is that the outer edges (maybe 1/4\") of the pad do not respond to touch. You don't need to hit the line exactly, but you do need to make sure you're not right at the edge, which frequently requires a look. This is the most annoying problem I have with the n81vp.- Keyboard quality and noise is fine. It's comfortable to type on. It's not silent, but not noticeably loud either.- The function key is where most people would expect 'control' to be, but after a few weeks with the laptop, I find myself getting used to this.In summary, the Asus N81VP-D2 is great for audio production, multimedia work, gaming, and most other demanding tasks.It's a waste of money for more casual users and no good if you need long battery life.","Date":"December 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Fast and reliable","Author":"Y. Wang","ReviewID":"R314JUJORN7YXM","Overall":"good","Content":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer that this is one superb notebook.  I was also looking for a notebook that is not too large (15\" and above) nor too small and underpowered (12\" and less).  In the 13\" and 14\" range, I pretty much narrowed it down to ASUS and Dell Studio XPS 13\".  I own a two-year old Dell XPS 13\", which had its motherboard replaced twice in two years due to heat issues (this seems to be a very common problem with Dell XPS 13\" line and Dell doesn't seem to acknowledge it or actively try to find a solution).  Bestbuy has Dell Studio XPS 13\" at about the same price as this ASUS, but with only one-year warranty.  As can be expected, I am hesitant to make a purchase due to my past experience.ASUS is fast and stable with Windows 7.  The machine looks and feels well built.  Furthermore, the machine stays cool even under heavy use.  The small complaints I have are that it doesn't come with dedicated media keys/buttons, and the keyboard definitely feels different from that of Dell and takes some getting used to.  Certainly, I am not faulting ASUS for these.  A good thing is that you are getting a bargain buying from Amazon.  I was in Taiwan last December - the same ASUS model sold there for roughly US$1,300 - when you would expect a lower price because ASUS is a Taiwanese brand.  I guess Amazon's trade volume must entitle it to a huge discount.","Date":"January 6, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great Deal!","Author":"C. Costello \"crcostel\"","ReviewID":"RR174SAAGFU40","Overall":"good","Content":"When I purchased this laptop I had several criteria1) Powerful enough to last my family 3 years at least2) Enough gaming power to do light gaming3) Portable - I didn't want a 17\", I wanted 14-15\"4) A maximum of around $10005) A quality name/warranty - this is a laptop afterall1) Power - The \"windows experience\" rating is 5.8 but that is due to the replaceable hard drive. The Processor got 6.4, the graphics 6.7. While the stated max of the motherboard is 4gb RAM, its reported to handle up to 8gb. No this isn't one of the lasted i7 or i5 processors but its a very powerful dual-core and if you aren't doing media editing this will last a long time.2) Gaming - I have Dragon Age running at max details and it doesn't even skip a beat. The specs call the graphics chip a HD4650, the sticker says HD4670. The only difference between the two is clock speed, and this is clocked as a 4650. You could over clock it but I don't see the need yet. This isn't a laptop for hardcore gamers but it can play hardcore games.3) Portable - this is a 14\" laptop with desktop replacement hardware! Of course the downside is the tiny battery can't keep up. I'd suggest buying a spare battery or staying near an outlet.4) When I got this laptop it was 1000 w/ a 100 dollar rebate, its gone up a bit but its still a steal!5) Most laptop companies give a 1 year hardware failure warranty. Asus gives a 2 year hardware and 1 year accidental damage. Oh and Asus laptops are much more reliable than HP/Dell/Gateway ones.Cons:1) Battery2) No DVI output3) Battery4) Typical bloatware5) BatteryBottomline: Get it while you can!","Date":"January 12, 2010"}
{"Title":"Hardware/software issues, poor WLAN card and hard drive","Author":"E. Loehr","ReviewID":"R2QQ3DCXLFJP73","Overall":"bad","Content":"I regret purchasing this computer; it really is not worth the price compared to others on the market now.  I have also had some issues with the computer itself.  If you Google \"ASUS N81 crash\" you will find that many people are experiencing random system crashes, especially when trying to do any gaming at all on this computer.  There is a possible hardware issue that causes the crash, which many assume to be from the ATI Mobility card, but ASUS has not acknowledged it.I sent my machine back to ASUS for repairs due to all the random system crashes I experienced; it was updated as \"Repaired\" and assigned a tracking number the day after received.  I called and they said no issues were found with my computer.  I called several times and left my number several times, but they would never let me speak with a supervisor, and a supervisor would not call me back.  I got my computer back and found that they had removed all the AMD/ATI software from the machine, but didn't make any mention of this on their notes.  There is a problem with either the graphics card and/or its software.  I did a full reformat and fresh install and got rid of all the ATI and AMD software except for the driver, and my system no longer crashes.  The WLAN card included is also really weak.  I replaced mine with a Gigabyte GN-WI07HT-RH that I had in an older machine, and it gets much better connection.  The hard drive is a Seagate Momentus 7200.4.  Just google the name of the hard drive and you see what a piece of crap it is.  It's a noisy, clunky hard drive; I guess I will replace it with a Hitachi drive on my own dime.  No real reason to RMA it for the loud Seagate because it seems like it's the product itself that is a joke, not just mine.This computer has had issues with multi-tasking.  It locks up and requires a full reboot.  When I watch stream feeds, I have to reboot 3-4 times in a 2 hour period.  I have a netbook that performs better than this computer.  It's pretty much a piece of crap.I experienced terrible customer service, a poor warranty/repair department, and unaddressed shutdown issues make this a computer to avoid, in my opinion.  I have purchased three ASUS laptops in the past three years, but after the experience with this one, it will be my last.","Date":"February 9, 2010"}

{"Title":"Superb Quality, Best Bang for the Buck","Author":"E. Rodriguez","ReviewID":"RH19D7BOJTS3N","Overall":"good","Content":"It's amazing how people can be so picky. First of all there's no such thing as the perfect laptop/notebook but to me this comes pretty damn close. I fully researched my options and came to the conclusion that this laptop was the most bang for the buck you can buy in this size range. It's even more powerful than some 15/16 inchers out there plus a lot less expensive. I didn't want anything too large or bulky that would divert from the original concept of having something portable but I still didn't want anything too small that would lack power and performance. To me the ASUS N81VP-D2 is the best combination of performance, power and size. The 16:9 LED screen is crisp and vivid with superb HD quality. The key board is nice and responsive and unlike the other review I didn't experience anything flimsy about it what so ever although it would of been a huge plus having a backlit keyboard but no biggie I can live without it. The 320gb 7200rpm drive is nice to have because it boots up pretty damn quick and there's plenty of storage to go around for the average end user. The trackpad is not the worst yet not the best but it's manageable and not frustrating like others say. I personally disable it and just use a wireless mouse. The battery life is the only minor draw back I can think of but what can you expect when you practically have all the bells and whistles under the hood. Windows experience is as follows: Processor 6.4, Memory 6.4, Graphics 6.7, Gaming Graphics 6.7, Primary Hard Disk 5.9 and that's just out of the box. If you're still having second thoughts, don't. You wont be disappointed by the value and quality you will receive. Try and find a laptop with similar features and configuration as this one and you'll see you can't because first of all the video card on this one is the best you can get in a 14 incher to date and second you get two years global warranty, one year accidental or two if you register your laptop within 30 days of purchase(no brainer) all included when others charge you an arm and a leg for that. Plus ASUS was ranked first in quality by the wall street journal. Luckily I purchased the laptop at the right moment and got it for only 695 with  applicable offers and rebate, free two day shipping and another big plus---not  a dime of taxes!

{"Title":"Mostly great!","Author":"DaddyGo","ReviewID":"R27L2305ZKU1V9","Overall":"good","Content":"The ASUS N81Vp-D2 is a great laptop. It is powerful enough to handle most of today's games (currently playing Dragon Age and The Witcher on high settings)and has handled every business application I have thrown at it without a hiccup. The screen is bright and crisp although viewing angles are a little less then optimal. Not bad though. It doesn't come with 4650 vid card like is advertised. It actually comes with a 4670! Not sure how much better it is but better is good. Boot up is fast as is shutdown. Windows 7 is great although I upgraded to Win 7 Pro using the Anytime Upgrade, which went off without a hitch in less then 10 minutes. The laptop is pretty solid but the lid does have some flex and the keyboard feels \"loose\" in the upper left corner. The keyboard also has the \"Fn\" and \"Ctrl\" keys reversed which causes some headaches but I'm sure I'll get used to that. The built in speakers are excellent for a laptop. They sound much better if you have the laptop sitting on a table then if it is in your lap but, again, for laptop speakers they are great.The biggest issue I have with this laptop is the battery life. I expected it to be bad, considering the specs, but I wasn't prepared for just how bad it is. Just surfing the web on power saver mode I can get just under 2 hours. If you turn off wi-fi and just do business applications or Word/Excel type stuff, you might be able to get 2 1/2. Forget watching movies or gaming. There are no extended life batteries available either. I guess it is not a huge deal for me since I use mine mostly at home or at the office so I can keep it plugged in but it should be taken into consideration if you need to use it on battery power a lot. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase but I will most likely be buying another power adapter so I don't have to lug it around with me.","Date":"January 7, 2010"}

Although Asus has been around for years making component parts such as motherboard and video cards, only recently have they become an aggressive U.S. player in the P.C. market for complete system solutions. I have purchased,tested, and own an eee series netbook, a 24\" LCD Monitor as well as the N81vp-D2 power house laptop. I have easily sold 4 of the N81VP-D2 to clients in the last two months.Asus is one of a handful of manufactures where the paper specifications and product quality match. The laptop is an easy sell for most on the go professionals. The N81VP-D2 is very well crafted, comes with one of the top of the line Core 2 Duo processors, an exceptional 5 usb ports, HDMI, great LCD Screen, high end video card, 7200rpm drive and a warranty double the industry standard (2yrs). Asus also includes a carry bag, lcd cleaning cloth and usb mouse with the unit.  The only disappointment is that the unit does not come with Windows 7 Professional which limits my ability to sell the product. The speed and performance is virtually identical to most of the new i7 Processors which cost significantly more.Two thumbs up on this product and Asus.","Date":"April 10, 2010"}
{"Title":"Very good.  Power.","Author":"G. Fernandez","ReviewID":"R1O8961HZ90JFO","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, let me tell you what I mostly use this laptop for:  gaming.  I'm not the type though, that needs to play everything at the highest settings.  This differences seem minor to me--definitely not worth the $1000 difference for a more high-end laptop, i.e. Alienware.  I did some comparing before I got this Asus laptop and this was by far the best deal (to me).  I looked into Sony, Apple, and Alienware.  To get one of these competitors' laptops I would've had to dish out at least a couple hundred dollars more (for the sony) or over a thousand more (alienware and apple).  If you check out the specs, the differences aren't that great.  This is especially true if you want something that's PORTABLE.  I mean, you could get a 17\" laptop that'll blow this Asus laptop out of the water but I didn't want to lug around a huge computer.  Anyway, on this laptop I'm currently playing Fallout 3, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Star Wars (KOTOR), and Deus Ex and I'm loving it!  All are running GREAT on medium settings.  Deus Ex is older, so that one I have on max settings.  According to other reviews, the laptop CAN play them on high settings but I don't want slow-downs or crashes.  Speaking of which, it does have hiccups at times when gaming but they are VERY few and far between.  If you save often, you shouldn't have a problem.  Also, from what I've read, hiccups are common on PC games no matter what.  As for other things (surfing the web, streaming video, docs, etc), the laptop is flawless:  runs fast, really fast.  No crashes, no getting stuck, no hiccups.  Only downsides I have seen to this machine are:  the keyboard and the battery life.  I don't care about the battery at all.  I always use it plugged in.  The keyboard is not so great.  Some of the keys (on the left side) feel mushy, or springy (I don't know how to describe it).  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.  It's a great machine.  With the speed of technology though, it'll probably be \"old\" within a year.  This Asus laptop looks great too!  A great price for a great machine!","Date":"March 15, 2010"}
{"Title":"Asus N81Vp 14\" Laptop Review","Author":"eRawk","ReviewID":"R2GG78IO69669Q","Overall":"good","Content":"I've now owned this laptop for about 2 months, and here is my review.First of all, it has a great price with the rebate for the power. HOWEVER, Asus' rebate is tricky. If you mail it in, you can either wait for 8 - 12 weeks to get your full $[...] rebate (at least the rebate applied to my time frame), or you can get your rebate rushed to you in 2 weeks for a [...]$ processing fee. Kind of weak, but that's okay I don't expect much from mail-in rebates.This laptop is very powerful for what it is - boots up super fast, shuts down fast, and does great overall. The wireless connectivity is excellent. Here is my list of props:-Powerful computer, handles games with high to medium high settings, processes media and videos seamlessly-Very portable, fairly light weight-Connectivity rocks, lots of ports-Nice looking screen, very bright and non glossy-Comes with Windows 7, which is vastly better than Vista-Comes with a lot of great accessories, and the laptop bag is excellent-Good battery life. I get about 4 hours on economy mode if I don't do anything intensive, and probably can last for 2 hours on \"entertainment mode\" (for a little over 1 movie or so)-Great Asus add-on software. While I installed most of what it came with, some of the utilities are freakin' awesome!-Excellent warranty. If you mail in the warranty card within 30 days of purchase, you get an additional 1 year accident extension on your warranty!This laptop isn't perfect. Here are my cons:-Keyboard doesn't keep up quite as well as I hoped! I type very fast (100+ wpm) and it often lags when I type or skips letters. Also, the keys on the left side tend to make more noise than I feel a laptop keyboard should.-Left click and right click near the touch pad are very loud. You can hear them for miles. Awkward in the library.-Comes loaded with typical bloatware, however the stuff you don't want isn't proprietary and can be removed easily. Made my comp run a lot faster after that!-Control key is swapped with the function key. I have been slowly getting used to it, but it is pretty annoying initially. Stupid decision on Asus' part.-Typical in terms of finger print magnet. I windex it pretty often because it takes them on easily.Overall, this laptop is very deserving of the rating. I would actually give it a 4.5 out of 5, but I can't with the stars. I think some people exaggerate the ability of the battery - mine does pretty well. Of course it won't last long unplugged if you game or watch movies, but very few laptops do. The charger itself is lightweight, small, and has a very long cord which is quite convenient. This laptop is very powerful for it's weight and class.If you are looking for the \"do it all\" laptop, I would recommend this. It is very balanced in terms of power, weight, battery life, and features. It surely isn't perfect, but no laptop is as far as I am concerned. For the price, it's a good purchase, and I am very pleased with mine.","Date":"March 8, 2010"}

{"Title":"Great hardware BUT had to return, TWICE =(","Author":"N. K. Nguyen \"chubbywubby lubber\"","ReviewID":"R1D6EGUYK8KKXE","Overall":"good","Content":"Before buying a new laptop, I had done considerable amount of research online about Asus' line of notebooks.  I had to get a new laptop since my super old Sony Vaio's switchable wifi (a horrible idea -.-) broke and thus it was no longer a laptop but a desktop since I had to connect via ethernet cable.  After looking at different brands, I decided that Asus provided the best hardware for the most affordable cost.  Buying another Sony Vaio with equal specifications would've cost me about twice as much, so Asus seemed like a no-brainer.  As a college student, I was looking for a portable laptop with enough power for casual gaming.  I'm not a hardcore gamer, just into those those generic type MMOs.  Of course this Asus model had more than enough power for casual gaming so I was glad, especially with its 1GB DDR3 VRAM.  With a 14 inch screen, it was perfect for mobility but also for watching movies, shows, and the occasional gaming.  The processing is super fast.  Relatively few bloatware, but easy to remove.  The longest it lasts is 4 1/2 hours without wifi, and 3 1/2 hours with wifi on battery saving mode.  I'm reviewing this laptop based on its specs, which are superb for the price, but I did experience problems with it that ultimately made me return the product.In the end, I received two of these models, both experienced system errors and defects.  The first one kept popping up a window saying \"Windows Explorer Error,\" which closed every application running.  The first time it happened was on the third day after its delivery, but I didn't use it almost at all those first three days because the Internet was down at my house.  I realized that anytime I did a right click on a folder or file, this window would pop up.  Obviously this got to be very annoying, especially when it happened multiple times within a minute.  After hearing such great reviews about Asus, I didn't want to give up on it entirely, since this was my first purchase from them.  I called Asus customer support to try to troubleshoot the problem, but to no avail.  So I had to return this first one for a replacement.  I just thought I was unlucky and got a bad egg, so I was hoping the replacement would be free of any problems.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  Although the replacement didn't have the same problem as the first, it had its own problems.  This time, the new laptop experienced random restarts or shutdowns.  The first time it happened was the very day I received it.  I didn't want to think anything of it since it was a replacement and I didn't want to believe that I received another defective model.  I was in denial for a week, since I wanted to give it another chance, but the laptop kept restarting or shutting down for no reason at all every day.  Sadly, I decided on returning it instead of getting another replacement.  I didn't want to go through the hassle again, especially with the fear of another defective model.  Oh, and I did a full system scan for any viruses, and there was none both times, so I'm guessing its a problem with the internal system itself.Maybe I was just unlucky twice?  Well, even so, all I wanted was a normal functioning laptop.  I don't think that's too much to ask for.  Oh well, but I am giving this model 4 stars because everything else about it was fantastic.  My first experience with Asus obviously didn't go so well, but I'm not giving up on it yet!  Presently, I'm waiting for the release of the UL30Jt.  Actually, before deciding on the N81Vp-D2, I had a hard time choosing it over the UL30Vt.  I'm too anxious about ordering another N81Vp-D2, so this next time around I'll be ordering a different model.  Asus does give you the most bang for your buck though, which is largely what's influencing me to give it another shot.","Date":"February 3, 2010"}

{"Title":"Terrible laptop, terrible brand","Author":"Dhruv","ReviewID":"R3CGYKRO9YDDKS","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this laptop towards the end of 2010. At that time, Lenovo was bundling the laptop with Windows 7 OS. When I upgraded with the Windows 7 OS copy that Lenovo sent to me, my battery stopped working.I contacted Lenovo several times to resolve the issue. Their technicians at first denied the existence of the problem (even though many people have encountered this issue), then later upon subsequent calls stated they did not know what the problem is. They ran me through circles of updating firmware, power drivers, etc. but nothing worked. All this time I could only use my laptop while it was plugged into an outlet, no real mobility could be achieved with it. Whats the point of a laptop then?Luckily for the miserly geniuses that work at [communist] Chinese owned and operated Lenovo,  my warranty expired shortly thereafter. I call again later hoping the evil geniuses have 'figured out' the problem and they now want to charge me approximately $60 to diagnose as I am out of warranty.Please take a moment to read their forums before you purchase.My laptop has buttons that have popped off, a hinge that is broken, and trim work that is broken. Its truly a piece of crap laptop and I'm an IT expert that has used: Toshibas, Dells, HPs, Macs, etc. and have NEVER, EVER seen such a poorly built laptop. Even the keys feel cheap. I should have not purchased this without testing it out at the store first, I got performance/price greedy and liked the hardware specs.NOT WORTH IT. NEVER BUY A LENOVO.","Date":"August 12, 2012"}

In general this computer has never been stable enough for me to trust it for any other use but web browsing and the ilk.I still like the thinkpads (this ideapad sucks all around though), but this is my last lenovo for no other reason then they sell crippled hardware - not cool, I paid for the cpu let me use it.","Date":"March 8, 2012"}

{"Title":"Don't Buy This Laptop.","Author":"Jae H. Han","ReviewID":"R5YP4QTRNIHJP","Overall":"bad","Content":"Before I launch into my vindictive diatribe, I would like to say that perhaps I am in error. Perhaps I did not take better care of my computer (although I doubt it, since my previous laptop from Acer lasted me a good 4.5 years, all through my undergraduate career, and had been subject to much more battering than this laptop), or that I should have been more sensitive to this computer's needs, but at this point, I am very convinced that I will never buy a laptop from Lenovo again. This is my first review, possibly my only review ever, but my experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I think you deserve a warning.Service Issues:1) Lenovo messed up my online order. I'm not even sure how this is possible. First, they said my CC did not get authorized. I called my bank. They said they authorized it. Lenovo denied it again. Lenovo told my bank to call them so they can work things out. Convoluted things happen. They do so, and I receive my laptop. Unfortunately, I'm charged twice for the same laptop, and Lenovo sends me a two copies of the same laptop. I try sending the first one back, but they do not give me a warning when the person will come to pick it up. Because of the nature of my job, I cannot simply just wait around all day waiting for the mailman. I hold unto the laptop. (my mistake)2) I finally call Lenovo again to send in the extra laptop. They give me a code. I put it on the box, go to the UPS store and ship it in. A few weeks later, I get a notice saying that the shipment never arrived. I call, they look into it; apparently, they received a box without anything in it. At this point, exasperation ensues. How is that even possible? They file a missing box/shipment. The issue is, to my knowledge, still unresolved.Now, onto the laptop itself.1) Webcam breaks within 3 weeks. It picks up light, but monochromatically. Not worth using. (It was good when it worked though)2) Battery breaks down within 5 months. Laptop recognizes that battery is plugged in, but does not use it. I've been told that because the battery isn't part of the warranty, I have to pay for it myself. Fine. I'll do it once I finish my project and don't need a laptop. (FYI, you need to send in this computer back to Lenovo so they can fix it. You will be laptopless for a while, not sure how long since I cannot send it in until after one of my projects is completed. But, still a major major inconvenience.)3) Sound quality is terrible. The laptop sound system crackles often, and although it is loud, the incessant sound fuzz is just enough to just have me plug in my iPod instead directly into the laptop itself. I am not an audiophile, so people with more refined auditory systems might be really repulsed by the sound.3) As a minor pro, in contrast to the major cons, it IS a fairly light laptop. However, there is a great sense of fragility to this laptop, and does not feel at all sturdy. After my webcam and battery breaking, I'm just afraid that this machine is going to break down completely. I've stopped carrying it around as much, and have relegated it as a desktop-laptop, which of course, completely gets rid of the very idea of having a portable laptop in the first place.Conclusion:I wish my experience with Lenovo had been more positive, that they could get the order right in the first place, and that this laptop was not so fragile. Overall, there seems to be better options available, so I recommend you look elsewhere first. I wasn't suckered into buying this laptop; I thought it would be genuinely good. I do like that they put in Windows 7, that the processor is fast, the RAM quick, the keyboard \"clicky\". But, my personal experience with Lenovo has been so bad that I just cannot in good conscience recommend this laptop.","Date":"April 15, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great value!","Author":"J. F. Monaghan","ReviewID":"RRVAVJU7N043G","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, I am a Mac person. I don't know that much about PCs. The reason for buying this particular model was money. I would have had to pay $1700 for a comparable laptop from Apple. I could not see spending all that money for a computer that was to be mainly used for word processing and web browsing. While made of plastic, this laptop has a solid feel to it. When opened, it doesn't seem like it will split into two pieces or that the screen is flexing. The keyboard is not flimsy and it should be able to take a lot of use. (I've only had the computer for a couple of weeks.) This model comes with Windows 7 and so far I like it. Very easy to set up. Connecting to my network was a breeze. Installing a couple of programs was also easy. Updates are simple. I have had limited experience with Vista and did not care for it. Windows 7 is a much better, user friendly, operating system. As I said previously, I have had this laptop for a short period of time, but so far I have no complaints and no regrets. A lot of computer for a little bit of money.","Date":"November 18, 2009"}
{"Title":"A pretty good laptop overall, unless you need accurate color.","Author":"A. Forward","ReviewID":"RZ2UB6YZK92WN","Overall":"good","Content":"The LED backlit display that I thought would produce better colors thinking that LED backlit was all the hype in LED LCD HDTVs like Samsung, Sony, etc. produces a slightly purplish color cast to the image. I thought getting the LED backlit display at such a low cost was a great deal, but I guess you really get what you pay for. In this price range, I'm almost thinking a traditional CCFL backlit LCD would have looked more accurate in terms of colors. If you're using this for photography, I would stay away. If you're using it for web surfing or word processing, it won't matter. For my desktop I have a color calibrating Samsung display, so right away I can notice the purplish color cast on the Lenovo. I did attempt to correct for the hue by running my color calibrator on it, which helped, but didn't completely fix it.","Date":"April 19, 2010"}

I called and had a response within 2 minutes.  I had a minor issue regarding the features on the notebook and was assisted and off the phone in ten minutes.Perhaps if something serious goes wrong you may find it annoying.  For example, we have an HP notebook and it took 3 technicians and a supervisor and over 3 hours of our time to get them to ship us a replacement battery for a brand new computer.The margins are very thin on these machines, so don't expect them to come to your door.  If you buy a $400-$500 computer you cannot expect them to provide you $400 worth of support time if you are inept in computing and not hardware savvy.This notebook is an absolute steal for the money and very well made.  My only complaint and it appears in HP as well is the notebooks run a tad hot.  I have not had any problems as a result, but it may be a good idea to get a cooling pad for while you use it at home.  If you are a road warrier, traveling coolers are available as well.The notebook has excellent battery life, an astoundingly nice display and a well designed keyboard.  All touchpad's stink, from the HP to Dell.  So, get a notebook mouse.Great notebook for the money!!","Date":"December 26, 2009"}

I am writing this in 2014 and if you are reading this, you are considering buying a used G550. What you need to know -- they were a middle of the road value when new and they are a middle of the road value now. The specs are more than enough to run Win7 (the early G550s shipped with XP) and keep you computing at a reasonable pace for years. Hard drive swapping is very easy hardware-wise, assuming you know the procedure (Hint: get a $20 \"universal USB cable\" one of the free cloning utities, and you're good to go). The Lenovo service issues are all real -- Apple they are not -- but as a used buyer you don't care. THE ONE KEY ISSUE IS THE TRACKPAD. It stinks and the fault is Lenovo's for going with the cheaper supplier. There is no driver fix. Don't be fooled. So if normally use an external mouse, you're fine. If you rely on the trackpad, you could go quietly mad with this one, it misses command after command without warning,  and you should look elsewhere. Final top: used Thinkpads cost more but are better built overall.","Date":"April 19, 2014"}

{"Title":"Lenovo - avoid it","Author":"Suresh Subramaniam","ReviewID":"R13FKRLOMOJUWC","Overall":"bad","Content":"My purchase from Lenovo left a bitter taste in my mouth.  I purchased a Lenovo G550 inNovember 2009.  I was looking for a basic laptop for my daughter who only browses, chats anddoes her homework on the computer.  I did not really need all the multi-media and high endgraphics so touted by all computer sellers.  My search narrowed to Dell and Lenovo.  Ialready had a Dell and it was working fine after 3 years. I did some research and talked tosome friends and some of them recommended Lenovo.  My company provides Lenovo laptops forits employees to use.  I normally find that at least one of my team members have to go thetechnical support to repair their laptops every week and I dont have a very large team.  Inspite of all this adverse information regarding Lenovo quality, I still took the plunge andordered a G550.  The deal was good at $449.One of the first things that gave me a pause was that Lenovo advertised the laptop as\"Intel Dual-Core Processor\" leaving out the word \"Pentium\" (they have corrected this hence,maybe due to feedback from customers).  I thought in the beginning that it was a Intel Core2 Duo processor and was delighted to get one at this price.  Later after some more researchit turned out to a \"Pentium' processor which is inferior to Core 2 Duo.  Some blame shouldalso go to Intel for this similar naming, but other computer sellers include the word\"Pentium\".I ordered it and they shipped it (Customer Number: 4969111, Order: 2E1LJR).  It took about15 days to arrive which was normal as per the lead time published on their site.  But, whiletracking the package, I found that the laptop was shipped from China, and passed throughKorea and Japan before reaching Alaska and I was wondering how Lenovo could afford to shipan individual package from China to US and still be competitive.The laptop arrived and we opened and installed it.  An irritating setup feature was thenumerous preloaded advertisements in the laptop asking you to subscribe to some service orthe other.  It was like doing an online survery.I liked the face recognition feature.  The laptop was solid enough, a little heavy and bulkybut I had known that.  After 2 days my daughter reported that the laptop was not shuttingdown.  When you try to shut it down, it goes to the One Key Rescue Screen.  When you try toexit the One Key Rescue, it gives you two options - either you can reboot or shutdown.  Ifyou choose Reboot it would restart again.  If you choose Shutdown, it would go off andrestart again and go back to the One Key Rescue screen.  You are stuck in an infinite loop.I called Technical Support and the nightmare started.  I had to hold for more than 30minutes to speak to a Technical Support person.  I explained the problem to her.  After apause and some background conversation she again asked me to repeat the problem.  Again shewent off and there was some background converation.  I could hear a male voice and somegiggling in the background.  She came on again and asked me repeat the problem.  By thistime I was mad and told her that I had repeated it twice before and was she not takingnotes? I repeated the problem and she was attentive this time.She put me through all the steps of getting the order number, serial number and trying totroubleshoot the problem like taking out the battery and reinstalling it and so on but noavail.  Then she gave me a case number (Case # wn147498)  and told me to call Sales and givethe case number and they will help me.  I told her that if I called again I would have tohold for another 30 minutes, but she said that she cannot transfer me and I would have tocall the 800 number again.So the next day I called the number again and after a hold of 40 minutes I got Sales.  Igave them the case number and the customer support person said that she wanted the Ordernumber and not the case number (which was in contradiction to what Tech support said).  Itold that I had called tech support and I had a case number but she was adamant that shewanted the order number.  I told her to hold on so that I could get the order number fromthe box, and she disconnected the call.  By then I was again mad.I called again next day and choose the option for Returns thinking that it could be easier.A recorded voice said that since they had 'unexpected high call volumes' the hold would bemore than 30 minutes and the call was disconnected.  I persisted and called again this timechoosing the 'Sales'option.  This time there was no recorded message.  It was clear thatthey wanted to discourage returns and only wanted to talk to people who were trying to buy.After a hold of over 40 minutes I got a customer support person.  I explained the problem tohim. He went through all the normal routine of how sorry he was that I had this problem andasked me to hold on.  He conferenced in a technical support person who seemed to be Chinese,from the accent.  I again explained my problem to this person and he asked me if I had donethe steps of taking out the battery, etc and I said yes.  Then he announced that I wouldhave to return the laptop and Lenovo will replace it.  I asked him if I had the option ofreturning it for a refund and he said no.  The only option was replacement.I was fuming again by this time and asked him why refund was not an option.  He justrepeated that I could not get a refund.  This made up my mind.  Till now, although I had arough time with their customer service, I was willing to give Lenovo the benefit of doubtand had only wanted a replacement.  When the technical support guy said that refund was notan option, then I decided that I dont want a replacement and wanted no association with thiscompany.When the customer support person detected that I was getting angry he broke in and told thetechnical support guy to can it and told him that he will handle it.  Then the customersupport guy told me that I could return it and get a refund if I wanted it.  I said yes andhe gave me a RMA number.  He also sent me an email providing the details.  I think thisperson repaired some of the damage his company's reputation had suffered in my eyes.After that it was smooth.  I sent the laptop back, they gave me the refund.  I was halfafraid that they would find some excuse not to refund the amount fully but it did nothappen.I bought a Dell the next day.","Date":"December 23, 2009"}

{"Title":"Software = Good - Housing = Bad","Author":"Michael Alston","ReviewID":"R1GH0Q851ERCGF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned this laptop for about 2 years and I would have to say that overall it suited our needs, but its also lacking a lot in physical integrity.The Good:I owned the T9400 Version of this laptop so it was very fast and performed great when watching Movies and playing games. It's also fast enough to run Adobe After Effects, which is a very high demand video editor. I've only had to completely restore the computer once, mostly for maintenance reasons. Otherwise just having a decent anti-virus program and keeping away from junk sites or downloads has kept it running just fine. I loved the huge screen! Also it has an excellent selection of external ports, just about everything you'll ever need. Plenty of USB Ports, VGA port, and my favorite was the Flash Card Port. Also the HDMI Port was great for quickly hooking it to a LCD or Plasma TV for great picture and sound. Lastly it has the upgraded version of Windows movie maker which is just about the best \"User friendly\" Movie editor other than \"I Move\" on Mac.The Bad:All that said I would have to say that my biggest complaints are about the housing and mechanics of the laptop. For one, anywhere some oils from our hands got on it, like the mouse pad or sides of the monitor, little marks started to appear and spread. Its as if the oil is corrosive and eats away at the finish. This has greatly reduced the resell value and overall appearance of the laptop. Also the Monitor Hinges are very poorly designed. Not long after purchasing it started to come loose and now we have to manually push it back into place on the left side. Other parts of the laptop are starting to snap out of place constantly. Also this is a very heavy laptop, perhaps its just the model I have. And like mentioned before the speakers a crap, but this is my first laptop so maybe its normal. The Media controls are nice but are very hard to see until after you touch them. Couple that with an UN-lit Keyboard and this laptop is terrible in the dark. Like I said most of my complaints are regarding the physical integrity, but we were pretty hard on it since we travel a lot.Summary: All in all I would say Dell did a good job on the software, but not so much the housing of the laptop. This would probably be a great item for a person that is not very mobile, but doesn't want a full Desktop PC. Less movement would solve the housing problems, and external speakers would solve the sound problem. So, Keep it in one place, and you're good to go!","Date":"April 23, 2011"}

The battery life is amazing, the display is awesome, and the fact that it already came with Windows 7 was really convenient. And it's so lightweight! As a web design major, I carry this thing around everywhere. My previous Dell brickbook nearly dislocated my shoulders. I'd recommend maybe getting a different color if you're worried about fingerprints, though, as they're quite noticeable. The only negative thing I have is the touch pad gestures. I thought that the \"pinch\" zoom in/zoom out features would be really handy but while browsing the web it would often zoom in and out on me without me doing much. But I just disabled that feature and it's great otherwise. :) It's a great buy, I'd recommend it to anyone.","Date":"January 12, 2010"}

I had a tough time deciding if I was going to get this particular laptop as there were a few very negative reviews regarding their service.  I decided to give it a go despite the negative reviews and although I have only had this laptop a day, I am extremely happy with it.  The screen is bright and clear, the keyboard is easy to use and not cramped and difficult to navigate, the laptop weight is the most surprising thing to me.  I thought it would be much heavier!  All in all, I am very pleased with the entire experience.  Especially how quickly Amazon got it to me.  Normally Dell makes you go through a laundry list of \"personalization\" steps, and then it takes a long time for them to \"build\" it.  I guess a lot of people want or need to personalize their laptops, but this one was perfect for me and I love how simple it was to buy.","Date":"January 12, 2010"}
{"Title":"Worst Laptop...EVER!","Author":"R. Bertoluzza","ReviewID":"R2T6D9S8GEJ2HP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this laptop after 3 months of very extensive research. For the price and the specs it seemed like the best possible choice. Boy oh boy was I wrong. After only 3 months I started to have problems with the charger. The laptop would only work if plugged in, it wouldn't charge and if the charger was even bumped, the computer would shutdown due to lack of power. So, called Dell and after a lengthy discussion to many other problems I'd been having as well, turns out the motherboard needed to be replaced, the whole charging housing, the hard-drive and the wireless card. I will say, I had great customer service and my laptop was returned quickly, but I did have to send it in. But, when I got the laptop back, they must've put in a different charger housing because my original plugin barely fits the hole, which was octogon before and is now round.It has now been 1 year that I've had it and the screen is going out. There's something wrong with the hinge and it makes the screen do very funny things and I have to jiggle it until the screen is clear. So, this is the worst laptop ever made. It's just kind of cheap as well. The plastic on it is awful.","Date":"August 24, 2011"}

{"Title":"The beast","Author":"D. Freeman","ReviewID":"RQGPAGCE5WYWJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been very happy with this laptop.  I have had the laptop for a year now, and it is a great laptop.  I paid the extra to get more memory and a good CPU and I haven't regretted it.  It is a good laptop with many great features.The Pros:  It is a fast laptop with a very good picture.  The sound is pretty good for built in speakers.  Good battery life (although I upgraded to a 9-cell to get even more life).  It will run a good many processes at a time.  I work in a marketing and design firm and there are times that I have IM, email, several web browsers, Excel, and music all running and it does not slow down.  I have never had issues with the keyboard like others have mentioned.  I have used this to type many long papers and reports and it works just fine.  I like having a number pad on the side of the keyboard.  It makes it easy to do calculations and to enter numbers in Excel.The Cons:  It is a large laptop. This would not be a good laptop for someone who will be walking around carrying it.  It is not too heavy, but big enough to make it cumbersome for a classroom setting or a board meeting.  I have enjoyed having multimedia buttons at the top of my keyboard, but it would be nice to make them separate from the F1-F12.  Fingerprints can be an issue if that bothers you.Overall: This is a good computer for your average user.  Someone who does a lot of gaming or who travels a lot would probably find this a little disappointing.  Anyone else would find that this computer is a great machine.  It is big, but it can do what you ask it to do.","Date":"February 6, 2011"}
{"Title":"Decent laptop, with nuisances","Author":"Phil (San Diego, CA)","ReviewID":"R1UT8X0DR66X73","Overall":"good","Content":"The very first week we had this, one USB port went bad, the internal jack simply lost its physical bonding to the external casing and stopped working. Dell Support shined here, they were fantastic. We were able to cross ship so we were never without a computer, and they sent us an identical model.All in all it's been a decent laptop. The generous display is impressive. A plus compared to smaller laptops is that you get the full number keypad on the right side of the keyboard. All keys are flat, so if you're a touch typist who is used to being able to feel the difference between keys by their being concave, this can either slow you down or contribute to typos. In such matters manufacturers shouldn't sacrifice usability in the name of trivial cosmetic sleekness.Before purchase I was aware that this model only had three USB ports. Unlike other laptops though, the jacks and connecting ports for power and devices and connectivity are on the sides of the unit. This model, having a 17\" display, is already wide so having to connect things on both sides extends the wideness even further. This can be cramped when sitting in an easy chair or on a flight with someone sitting in the next seat. We place it on a lap tray but if a USB device is connected on the right side, the mouse has to navigate around the protruding cords. Having a wireless mouse helps alleviate clutter although it'll still take up a USB port. If you get a lap tray, go for one that has a built in cooling unit. Like most laptops this one can get hot after a while.My biggest annoyance with this Inspiron 1750 is that in a contrived effort to provide added value Dell has imposed some defaults and utilities that obstruct the competent computer user. If you're familiar with using the F-keys for quick keyboarding to get things done, forget it. Dell has decided that these commands should now require the use of the Function key as well, e.g. Fn+Alt+F4 to close a window. Perhaps if you're a guitarist or a concert pianist, having to play a three note chord every time you want to use the F-keys might be okay, but for my use this interference renders the F-keys unusable. This is configurable but by the time I had time to bother with sorting out how to accomplish returning this to standard functionality my wife had become accustomed to the Dell defaults on this, our shared laptop. An additional hazard of Dell defaulting to Fn key usages rather than F-key standards is that it's relatively easy for a key combo to be bumped, or for something to fall on the keyboard, and suddenly the wireless connectivity is mysteriously disabled (Fn+F2) or the next time you bring up YouTube, audio output is muted (Fn+F7).If you're used to grabbing a window by its title bar to move it around the screen, or even clicking on one of the tabs across the top of your browser, the Dell Dock utility will block your intended use. Move the mouse cursor to the top of the screen, start to click on something, and as likely as not the Dell Dock will suddenly pop into view to capture your click and hijack the next thirty seconds of CPU cycles on behalf of some unintended process such as bringing up a webcam. When you have an operating system that allows for shortcuts on the desktop this is just stupid. This can be disabled, but it should be an available option rather than the default setting. It lends itself to the consideration that if this is the best value add that Dell can come up with, devices like laptops truly have become a commodity and beyond reliability ratings there's no reason to pay a premium for a particular brand.We've had this for two, maybe three years. Just got a notification that the battery was nearing the end of its expected life. That's a very handy notification and explains why the laptop powered down after just an hour or so of listening to audio while doing household chores. Shortly after purchase we contacted Dell to acquire a second power cord so we could have, in effect, two \"laptop stations\" in different parts of the house. If I recall correctly I think the extra power cord ran something like sixty bucks as an accessory. If you want to add accessories unique to this model it might not be a bad idea to search around for generic alternatives.Bottom line, a decent laptop intended for the computer-averse, not such a knockout that it would give Dell any advantage the next time I shop for a laptop. Another vendor could easily get my business next time around by offering the Professional edition of the OS rather than the crippleware that Home versions seemingly are.Update: priced out replacement batteries. The popup warning from Dell that appears on the screen to warn of the battery being near end of life also provides a direct link to purchase replacement batteries. A six cell runs around $150, a nine cell is currently $180.As I think about it, shortly after this laptop's original purchase, along with an extra AC power cord I ordered a nine cell through Dell's online chat to keep as a backup. With chat the problems of trying to understand the offshored support person isn't really a factor. But the replacement battery the person determined this model needed protruded from the back of the laptop such that we were unable to open it when the battery was installed. We returned it and just used the six cell we had; the typical life of the battery runs about two to three hours. To Dell's credit, the nine cell battery presented this time through the warning's link has the same shape as the existing battery and looks like it would fit without extending beyond the backplane. At $180 for a battery, though, it seriously makes you consider just ditching the laptop, spending another couple hundred and getting a different brand. I've looked at generic nine cells for this model here on Amazon but in spite of the deep discount, the images look exactly like the battery that didn't fit and had to be returned.As a quick side note, a glance at other current prices direct from Dell confirm my memory of this model's AC power cords being priced around $60.","Date":"July 19, 2011"}

{"Title":"Dell Inspiron laptop","Author":"Tamara Weidenfeller","ReviewID":"RMWT8QPQ6N8DJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently upgraded from a Dell Inspiron 1525 to this 1750 model.The differences....I defiantly like the BIGGER screen. (getting older I guess) The Volume control / speaker improvement with greater volume capacity is totally awesome. I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of this unit being so much bigger....it doesn't feel much heavier then the last one I had OR I am simply comfortable with the weight of this one. Also, the hinged portion of the unit <where the screen opens / lifts> is a HUGE improvement. The previous generations were cheap and actually pinched the wires that run through the hinge causing haze on the screen. This unit scores a TREMENDOUS improvement in this department from me.On the flip side....Dell still hasn't figured out how nice it would be for the cord (AC adapter) to be located in the back rather then the side. An improvement in that department would be nice but not critical to my daily use. I utilize the lap as little as possible and love the versatility of a carry along. Also, the keys on this unit are much different which I have found very difficult to adjust to. The previous lap tops I have had came with a beveled/raised keys whereas this unit is all flat. I am not a typist - I peck the keys with my index fingers and these keys seem to cause me fits....more errors. I never knew there was an option or difference in the keys but will certainly pay attention next time around.Over all....I give this new model 4 out of 5 stars....there still is room for improvement.","Date":"March 3, 2010"}

I noticed on the Dell website that the estimated shipping date was 12/18. I thought, great, just in time for Christmas. My order was confirmed within a day with an estimated ship date of 01/11. Three weeks after the estimated ship time on their website.The real problems began when I called customer service to cancel the order. Four phone calls were made on 12/12 totaling over an hour to cancel the order (unsuccessfully). I was repeatedly transferred and eventually was told that the people that could help me had all gone home for the night. My second attempt to cancel the order was on 12/14. I asked for a customer service manager and was placed on hold for approximately 45-50 minutes. A regular customer service rep picked up the phone and told me that the order could not be canceled because it was \"in production\". I told the rep that the computer had not been manufactured yet (shipping one month from now) and that I needed him to cancel the order. I was placed on hold again for a few minutes and the rep told me again that he could not cancel the order. When I threatened to call my credit card company to refute the charges eventually the rep relented and told me that he could now cancel the order.I wasted two hours of my time just to cancel an order.In the event of an order cancellation, is it Dell policy to place someone on hold until they give up? I am disappointed in Dell after having good experiences with them over the years and I ended up giving HP the business instead. Dell has been known for good customer service, but after reading some reviews and having a bad experience myself I feel like this may no longer be the case.","Date":"December 14, 2009"}

I do a lot of 3D modeling and this has made my life so much easier compared to my old machine.- Second headphone jack makes it perfect for watching DVDs with your buddy while you're stuck in Afghanistan- Windows 7 works like a champ and looks great- Facial recognition software (FastAccess) makes login fast, easy, somewhat fun (not sure if Amazon config has this). May not work if the room lighting is weird.- Attractive design, battery has fair life and doesn't stick out like the badonkadonk my wife's HP.- Laptop speakers that don't suck. Awesome.

Best used in combination with a Zalman ZM-NC2000 Notebook cooler. The cooler runs off USB (but you don't lose a port because it has some on it), keeps the laptop from getting warm, and fits perfectly. I suggest the black one.- Somewhat hefty.

{"Title":"Great notebook for the price","Author":"Nathan Beauchamp \"ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...","ReviewID":"R241G72PTMH5U4","Overall":"good","Content":"I have a variation of the 1555 Studio configuration which consists of:1) P8700 Processor2) 4Gb Ram3) Full 1080x1920 screen4) 500gb 7200rpm hard drive5) ATI HD4670 1GB GPU6) BlueRay driveI bought it around Black Friday directly from Dell for just over a grand.Based on some of the comments/negative reviews of this computer, I'd like to say that I have owned and used Dell computers for over 10 years, and aside from one really crap Optiplex220 workstation, have had nothing but good experiences with them across a diverse range of computers including everything from a Dell Mini 10 to a couple XPS gaming machines (before I got wise and started building my own gaming computers about 5 years ago). As a brand, Dell is frequently maligned for being either cheaply made or offering poor service. I can say that in my experience, neither is true. (And to put that in context I work in a an office with about 8 dell workstations that I am responsible for maintaining, in addition to the Dells I've owned personally). I've gotten great service from them including an overnight battery replacement (under warranty) when it really counted. So, while I recognize that any company as large as Dell is going to have some misses, my personal experience has been excellent.I'd also like to say that I own 5 computers (counting my wife's) including an HP, a custom built gaming computer, and even an Apple. I work with a whole host of computers on a daily basis (Macs included) and am not a fanboy of any brand or manufacturer, nor do I engage in the stupid PC vs. Mac debates. I love technology in general, and will go wherever I can get the features I want for the best price to enable me to finish the task at hand. I bought this Studio 1555 to replace my workstation since I wanted to be able to work remotely more easily.Now on to my actual review:First off, there is one thing I really dislike about this notebook and that is the keyboard (which I'm using to type this review). It's not a tactile thing, or responsiveness, my typical complaint against keyboards in general. The keyboard squeaks. Not all the time and not loudly, but certain keys on the right side, including the backspace key, make a slight chirping sound that I find very irritating.What I love about the notebook far eclipses that one irritation, and the screen alone more than makes up for it. As one of the very, very few 15\" notebooks that offers full 1080x1920 resolution, it is also one of the cheapest. If you're going to buy just ONE upgrade for this notebook, make it that one. Having that much real estate on such a beautiful screen is worth every penny. SONY is the only other computer maker I could find with 15\" notebooks with full 1080p resolution, and they are on average $500 more than this dell. You could argue they are better (less weight, possibly more stylish, etc.) but the bottom line is that the Studio 1555 with a 1080p screen for around a grand is a GREAT deal. Especially considering the screen is beautiful.The feature set on the Studio 1555 series is also quite good with the newer, faster P series processors leading the way. With their architecture they also use less power, which means a P series notebook will run longer than an identical T series notebook, all things being equal. Windows 7 64-bit being standard is awesome, and once coupled with 4gb (or even 8gb if you want to pay through the nose) of ram, make this a very speedy machine. Boot times are great, and I can easily multitask with several demanding applications with no slowdown.Aesthetically, the notebook is good, but not fantastic. I elected to get the 'chainlink black' version since I use this notebook for work and didn't need a fancy lid. The layout is functional and logical without being superior (this is where SONY excels--they're probably the only company with a sense of style that rivals Apple). The port configuration is great, with everything you'd expect (HDMI, 3-USB, Esata, SD card reader, VGA) and then a few bonuses (FireWire800, and TWO headphone jacks--fantastic for sharing a BlueRay with someone on a flight, etc...)The Build quality is average to good. The aforementioned keyboard squeak lowers this category significantly, as does the heat build up on the panel below the keyboard which makes my wrists sweat a little bit. Thankfully Dell did make some solid improvements, including a really good hing for the screen which is heavy duty enough to make me believe the screen will open&close; without losing any firmness for years. The charger is adequate, but with a strange layout that defies logic--the power cord (the end that plugs into the wall) is very short at about 3-feet. The single power cable that runs to the ntoebook itself is fairly long, but I'd really like to see dell make a power adapter more like HPs with a nice long cable on both ends (from the wall to the adapter and then from the adapter to the notebook).Battery life is fantastic and better than I expected. Even when taxing the n-band wireless while streaming videos or downloading files (which uses a lot of power) I can still get 3.5-4hrs out of the notebook. If all I'm doing is word processing, e-mailing, and other light tasks, I can get upwards of 5 hours. If you set your power profile to the minimum, it is possible to get Dell's claimed 7 hours, but you'll have to live with a very dim monitor and no wifi usage to achieve those numbers--not many real world applications where that would work.PROs:1) Excellent and truly top-notch screen (1920x1080 HIGHLY recommended)2) Great feature set for the price, especially with a few well chosen upgrades3) Functional design that while not convincingly beautiful, is very well suited to getting work done.4) Quality components for the price5) Very solid battery lifeCONs:1) Squeaky keyboard2) Strange, less than stellar power adapterFINAL THOUGHTS:I bought this notebook to replace my workstation in my office. It's more than exceeded my expectations overall. With a better keyboard I'd happily give it 5 stars, but that one element is distracting enough to downgrade the Studio 1555 to 4 stars. If you want a very strong feature set for the price, you have to at least consider the Studio 1555 series from Dell. Check out the comments section of this review for some thoughts on configuration/prices if buying from Dell.4/5 Stars. Recommended for those that value quality screens over pretty aesthetics.","Date":"January 10, 2010"}

I wanted to get a laptop for school, and shopped around a little bit, I almost got a dell insperon, but Dell was having a sale, and this computer was $100.00 off! So I bought it, and I love it.The 15.6 inch screen is really nice, you can see a lot, and 720p resolution is actually really good looking on this laptop. I like the glossy screen, but if you are sitting next to a window there might be too much glare.The HDMI output is a very nice feature because you can hook your computer to your TV and watch movies, or play games.I dont know if the one on amazon has the included backlit keyboard, but it is a very nice feature. The keys are very hard to see in the dark without it.It is really fast with 4 gigs of ram, it can convert movies to another format in an hour with the 2.2GHz  dual core processor.This laptop gets warm when you use it, but I have never had it get too hot. It has good battery life. I have gotten 5 and a half hours out of it just surfing the web, and I have watched 2 movies back to back on an airplane, the movies were not dvds (I copied the dvds to my computer beforehand because the optical drive takes a lot of power).Overall I would recommend this laptop.

{"Title":"Overheats and Continuously Fails","Author":"MommyTips.com \"Have fun being a mom!\"","ReviewID":"R3LLBIN3AA5WP5","Overall":"bad","Content":"Dell has a serious flaw in the design of this and their newer laptops/notebooks. They are making computers thinner and lighter which ends up restricting the airflow. This causes internal parts to overheat. The typical result in my computer is that the graphics card will overheat and cause the system to lock up.I have this Dell Studio 15\" with factory upgraded ram and other goodies totaling about $1000 investment. Since the new box arrived at my door a year ago, it has continually crashed and locked-up. Dell support has tried everything under the sun, short of giving me a new computer. This includes sending techs to my house and replacing internal parts like the graphics card, motherboard, etc. Alas, nothing changes. The fan always runs at full throttle within moments of start-up. If I try to watch a video or even if a web-page has anything using flash, immediately graphics card failure occurs resulting an over-sized cursor and a total system lock-up. My only option is to do a hard system shutdown. Disabling flash or other scripts only delays the inevitable.I have owned several Dells in the past and WAS a huge fan of Dell; however, this experience has left me very frustrated and disappointed. One tech advised me to purchase a Toshiba as they are not having this issue because their laptops are still a little bulkier providing better airflow.","Date":"June 6, 2011"}

I think this a great lap top and it gets the job done. I kept reading all the negative reviews and i have no idea why there's so much bad press. I have never once called customer service and i ordered my laptop at Dell directly through their website. I have no reason to contact customer service and i never experienced any problems at all with any of my Dell products. I get so baffled when i read all these negative reviews. My Dell products which i have had for years including a Dell desktop and a recently purchased new netbooks have never been a problem. The desk top i have is more than 6 years old and I never have any problems. It runs great. It can definitely benefit from an upgrade in some areas.The Studio line is Dell's midrange laptops. The Inspiron being there low end range for consumers that just need a standard laptop. The Dell Studio laptop is completely plastic and it's a bit on the heavy side in my opinion. Maybe because i am so use to my light weight Dell 10 min netbook that i have been spoiled. This is a good lap top. However, i think the flaw in Dell is that their products can get very pricey very quickly. Especially when you are adding in high end features like 6GB RAM rather than 3GB RAM or 2.99GHZ instead of 2.33GHZ etc. You can get the same thing at HP for probably around a hundred dollars less and their quality feels a bit more refined, polished, and sturdy. That being said if you check Dell's website they do have deals going on all the time especially on holidays. But for some reason the price never seems as low as it should be. If you check periodically you will find yourself a deal. I go to that website religiously and build the exact same laptop that I have and it always comes up to more money. I got mine on a special promo.I really regret getting the green covered case. I didn't realize how bright it would be and once i opened it out of the box - I really wish i purchased the Dark Blue or Dark Purple colored case. It's really way too bright. I like the personalization options of the different colors, but i really do regret getting this bright Caribbean green color. My laptop also includes the backlit keyboard which is great for typing in the dark. It also has touch sensitive controls towards the top of the keyboard near the speakers and i think that's a great plus. The DVD is also an optical drive, so there is no door that slides out for you to pop in your DVD. It's like a Playstation 3 slot. You slide the DVDs in & out.Pros:15 inch screenOptical DVD slot4GB RAM750 GB Memory2.66GHZBacklit keyboard4 UBS slotsHDMI outportSleak shiek designDifferent colored casesWi-FiWebcamCons:Windows Vista (Super Whack)A bit pricey in my opinion (That's Dell for you)A bit on the heavy side","Date":"January 4, 2010"}
{"Title":"Durable and satisfactory","Author":"csi_speedchick","ReviewID":"R36QHLDEHW55N5","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had my Dell Studio 1555 since September 2009. I've used it to play games, do college work, and other minor things. Anytime I have had an issue with something on the laptop the Dell support has been readily available to help me out and solve the problem quickly.I've seen a lot of reviews on here that say that this laptop overheats easily. I find this FALSE. (caps used for emphasis) Mine has never crashed because of becoming too hot, but it has become hot enough that the bottom was uncomfortable to touch.I have also read many reviews saying it has a terrible battery life. Mine is 3 years old and by setting it on \"Power Saver\" form the Power Options window, I get about 4-5 hours of battery life.For those of you who don't know or are curious, if you look in the bottom right corner of the screen there should be a battery icon that you can right-click on and select \"Power Options\" which will open a window that you can choose one of three different ways for your battery to use its juice. There's one that devotes most of the juice to high performance, but this drains the battery quickly. There's another that saves power (which is what I use), but says that it doesn't give very good performance - for doing college work, surfing the internet, playing games, and streaming videos/movies I find the level of performance to be very adequate for this option. The third level is a balance between the two...well, it says balance, but it devotes slightly more juice to performance than battery life (it's like a \"55-45\" ratio.)Now, here are the things I find unfortunate about this laptop...1. No number pad - this isn't awful, just inconvenient.2. No indication of whether or not Caps Lock is on unless you're on the log in screen. - Slightly annoying, but it's not too hard to type a letter and see the result.3. The grips on the bottom of the laptop come off easily if you slide your computer around on your desk. I lost all of mine over the course of the 3 years I've owned it, but unless you're always working on a slanted surface you really don't need them.Overall, I think this is a nice computer to have despite other reviews. I purchased mine from a Best Buy in 2009. I run Windows Vista and have not/will not \"upgrade\" to Windows 7 because Vista works for me.Oh! I have dropped the laptop repeatedly, but one time I dropped it hard enough to mess up the disc drive and Dell sent out a repairman ***to my house*** and he repaired it without any questions. It was very nice.I hope this review has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this product.UPDATE - 9.11.13I still have this laptop and am not having ANY issues with it! Runs great! When (or IF) it dies I will definitely purchase another one of these! I love Dell!!","Date":"January 25, 2012"}

The original Dell Studio continuously overheated and the left side plastic hinge and monitor frame broke.  Unfortunately, the new one didn't overheat, but the left side hinge and frame broke again.  The first and second time, the computer was covered under an extended warranty.  However, it broke for a third time now, and it's off warranty.  My wife and I have been careful and conscientious with this computer, and it keeps breaking.Now, there's also a power issue with the laptop - you can only use it after putting it in sleep mode.

{"Title":"I have owned this laptop for exactly two years now, and it's not going to last much longer","Author":"CommandoMirando","ReviewID":"R3AO6PO70L2IN1","Overall":"bad","Content":"To start, I use this laptop casually. I bought it for college for writing papers and surfing the internet. Occasionally for movies as well. When I first bought it, things were smooth, everything functioned right, it was put together nicely, no external noises, just vague amounts of overheating. As time goes on the battery starts to die out, but that's expected.Jump forward to the point where my year warranty is up.The laptop begins cracking, the frame is snapping apart and I snap it back into place constantly. The charger is also broken completely exposing wires that eventually broke apart and I had to buy a replacement. This is all from wear and tear of me just opening the laptop mind you. Up until this point the laptop is deteriorating. Processing wise, it's awesome. But it was not engineered correctly. It is at the point of replacement as the \"AC adapter can't be recognized\", and the screen doesn't line up with the laptop when closed exposing wires and the metal hinge which is misaligned. The power button becomes hard to press because of it's horrid location. I bought a new battery thinking that would fix the problem with the AC adapter, but it just won't charge. If I unplug it, it instantly shuts down, which is hard to avoid because of how loose the actual adapter is in the socket, causing me to lose work.I don't recommend this product or any newer dell products. I recommend trying Lenovo.","Date":"August 8, 2011"}

Seemed like it would be exactly what I needed.  Sadly, this has not been the case.  Initially, out of the box, everything was good and had no problems. Past 18 months has been a major pain.First problem:  Anywhere across the bottom of the keyboard can act as a touch pad at times.  Try writing a paper and all of a sudden your cursor is somewhere else and you have to go back and fix it.Second problem:  Could no longer adjust the sound.Third problem:  Screen disappears for no reason and then reappears when you move the cursor.  This also just happened while typing this.Fourth problem:  Overheating!Fifth problem:  I could go on, but you get the picture.Had it to the computer repair shop twice with some things being corrected and other things showing up.

{"Title":"Horrible, but Industructablly awesome","Author":"Adan","ReviewID":"R2U4KBIZHDH98J","Overall":"bad","Content":"First the bad:I bought this laptop just about 4 years ago when I was heading off to college. Worked great for about 3 months, then keys started falling off with everyday typing, the touch buttons along the top of the keyboard stoped working, the sound doesn't function consistently... ect (those were the big ones anyway). When I would shut my laptop without turning it off (goes into sleep mode), the laptop would turn itself back on randomly while being closed. This meant it would be on for hours without me knowing, and get incredibly hot to the touch. This issue has provided some good stories though... Occasionally ill be playin music or watching a movie with the laptop and shut it without turning anything off. It would kick back on in the middle of the night and scare the crap out of everybody in the room... Ah, Good times. I've sent in my laptop to dell on one occasion to try and fix the issues, they did replace the keyboard, but nothing else. Needless to say, this did not fix any problems (except for my missing keys!). Since I am a man and threfore can never be wrong about my purchacing decisions, it has to be dell's fault. After using about $50 more minutes than my cell phone plan offers, I got Dell to send me a new refurbished laptop. The keys have stayed put on this one, but all the same problems as the last one.Now the good:Once you find all the quirks with the computer, you learn to live with them. Its the computer I bring to school with me because I'm too concerned about breaking a nice laptop. This thing refuses to die no matter what happens to it. It fell out of the back of my truck, I accidently shut it in the car door, ive dropped it in snow, soda and vodka have both been spilt into the keys, still refuses to die. One occasion, so much water was spilled on it, i literally tipped it on its side and poured water out of the USB port. After drying for a few days, only my wireless card got fried and therest works great. I have friends that have had one of these things happen to their laptop and had to get a new one. This is a downright horrible laptop, but at least I only had to buy one in 4+ years.","Date":"July 20, 2012"}

This computer EASILY overheats. Sitting on my lap with one World of Warcraft window will eventually overheat it to the point of force shutdown. A good cooling board fixes this. Maybe it's just mine, but the eject key no longer works (manually telling it to eject still does work). Even with a 6-cell battery (what mine originally had) it's a bit on the heavy side.Physical cons: Power cord insertion cap broke (easily fixed with glue and electrical tape. Pads on the bottom of the computer come off easily if you slide the computer (if you find them, again easily fixed with glue).I haven't had experience with a huge range of laptops. I do recommend Dell. They have fair prices and good customer support, but I don't know that I would recommend this Dell model specifically for college. There are better laptop and netbook models out there for college bound consumers.","Date":"January 9, 2012"}
{"Title":"Great Student Laptop Built to Last","Author":"Ellie","ReviewID":"R3GC4PD6VZYASC","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this laptop 2 and a half years ago on a Dell discount through my Dad's job. I'm not very technically savvy with all the upgrades and cards and all, but my Dad is - thanks to Dell's customization options, I got a laptop with the specs necessary to keep it from aging too quickly over my college years.Aesthetically, this computer is great. One of the first things I noticed about this laptop was how good it looks. I love the feel of the keyboard, and the trackpad works very well. The speakers are surprisingly good for stock computer speakers, and the ports on the sides of the laptop are well placed.All else aside, this computer has aged beautifully. Even after 2.5 years of regular use, the battery (not an upgraded one - just the stock one that came with the laptop) still gives me over 2 hours per charge - amazing! The hinges, which I was honestly a bit nervous about, have held up well. I have a chip in the plastic casing on one hinge, but that's because I dropped it once and it chipped off - no fault of the manufacturer. The screen is still pristine, and most importantly, this thing runs like it's brand new. My sister recently bought her first laptop for college and even after two years my Studio is still comparable.I'd recommend this notebook to anyone. A truly great purchase.","Date":"October 12, 2011"}
{"Title":"Would be good if...","Author":"Myra Binnicker","ReviewID":"R1BAVHWIMPXEKW","Overall":"good","Content":"There are a lot of nice features about this laptop. However, I feel I should address the biggest con first. It overheats like crazy. My daughter does virtual schooling, and it has thermal events in the middle of her work on a regular basis. I have tried cooling pads, and even stacking cooling pads, but it was little help. Without the cooling pad, it overheats when doing things as small as surfing the net. With cooling pads it is better, but still dies when doing something like Photoshop. The design doesn't help. The vent is in the rear of the laptop, and when you open the monitor, it covers the vent. It leaves nowhere for the heat to escape. Now for a basic breakdown:Pros:-We have the light up keyboard upgrade It is very quiet, and the lighting is soft, but nice.-The speakers are nice.-The chainlink design has a metal top instead of plastic. It feels nice and is easy to keep clean.-The graphics card does a nice job of keeping up (until the heat hits).-Media Player options built into the F keysCons:-The overheating issue...big one.-No number pad options-The keyboard occasionally goes out, and you have to go through this process to \"drain the flea power\"","Date":"February 16, 2011"}
{"Title":"Dell Delivers","Author":"Chinmay Hota","ReviewID":"R3W2LXOFNEN44K","Overall":"good","Content":"A crashed hard drive, a broken monitor hinge and a complete loss of important files later, I decided it was time to kiss my sweet Acer lappie goodbye for good.Being a gamer, I needed a computer which could handle graphics demanded by the seventh gen console's PC contemporaries, and had RAM capabilities. Well the graphics was really another company's headache but, few laptops provided that kind of customization, Dell being one of the few.Being the emerging choice selection of many of my friends and colleagues, I was intrigued by the Dell laptops. They provided three kinds of laptops depending on budget - Inspiron, Studio and XPS. Drooling all over the XPS just wouldn't bring the price into my budget, so I had to switch over to Studio. Inspiron just wouldn't handle my needs.With 250 GB DDR3 hard drive  and 4 GB RAM, the Studio 15 came with the customization option - everything from the aforementioned RAM (you could tone it down - let's face it, why would you), cover color, Graphics Card, Graphics Memory, Audio Card to name a few slots.Now the real headache was the Graphics card. Nvidia, the way it's meant to be played? Or ATI? (Intel was pretty much out). A lot of head-banging in front of the customization page later, I decided to go with ATI 4570 HD with 1 GB memory. My budget could buy me that.And voila, I had the makings of a laptop that was not too far ahead of its time, nor too far behind. My only gripe was that selecting a gloss-finish for the cover would have added a lot more to the total.Now the most important thing awaited: warranty. Being the most sacred document of understanding between the manufacturer and the customer, its absence would spell complete anarchy. My previous laptop met its maker so soon due to my lacklustre interest in the upkeep of its warranty - I was not going to let that happen another time.This could also be customized according to Dell - I went a little overboard and checked the 3 year limited warranty. Hey, better safe than blame someone else and better blame someone else than be sorry, huh?Yours is here. Yeah mine was here in a matter of 10 days, and boy did I love it. I played around with it like a 10 year old with his first Nintendo. My old laptop died a peaceful death as I revelled in my victory with modern technology. Games like Modern Warfare 2 and Assassin's Creed ran perfectly and movies with 1080p (which in 16:9 resolution is same as 720p only take more memory) ran with great aplomb. The screen was wide and so was my satisfaction.Intense competition was transcended by Dell with it myriad choice of products and customization options. I just wished everything else had as much customization possibilities as Dell provided me with. Good to know where the world is headed when it comes to non-Apple laptops. Oh wait, Apple doesn't make laptop; it makes Macbooks. Good job, Dell!Chinmay HotaAuthor of 'Hits and Misses'","Date":"December 27, 2010"}

It sounds like a jet plane taking off every time the fan cycles on, which seems to happen every minute or two. This is really distracting and disappointing for a thousand dollar computer.

{"Title":"Dell Studio 1555 1 year review.","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"RAZDN732TWIFQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I am reviewing a variant of the 1555 laptop shown here. My version has:CPU: P7450HDD: 500GBRAM: 4GBGraphics: ATI Radeon HD 4570Screen: 15.6USB: 2+1 eSata/USB combo.O/S: Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.I have had this laptop for most of a year now, and it has been a good work horse. I use it primarily for university work, and this has involved running AutoCAD, MatLab, ArcGIS, MS Office, Photoshop and, as I am a student, Oblivion GotY Edition, AoE2, Unreal Tournament, Trackmania, and GTA4.Useage-wise, it has excellent connection capibilities, though mineis without Bluetooth. I regularly use the HDMI out to connect to another screen, which makes doing research easier. The eSata port has not been used yet, though I am in the process of getting an HDD which will use it.There are twin headphone slots which you can customise for what they are being used for.The speakers are a little better than many laptops, but they are still quite tinny. With headphones, even cheap ones, the built in Audio Controls are excellent for setting up good sound.The Webcam is a little poor quality, but as an integrated unit, it is ok. The stereo microphones are very sensitive though.The trackpad is quite good, though I think the wifi card is below it, and it can get hot with heavy use.The DVD player is a slot loading device, and hasn't let me down yet. The annoying thing about its position is that it is directly above the single right hand USB port. If the device connected to the laptop has a large USB port connector, it blocks the DVD slot. Poor design choice there.The keyboard is ok, though I wish I had gone for the backlight keyboard.The media controls have taken over primary use from the function keys, which with prolonged use has shown to be a good idea, though a seperate set of buttons whould have been nice.Battery life is excellent. Even when running ArcGIS, modelling a geological map and a second screen with the internet running, I get a good 3-4 hours out of it a year down the line. With less intensive use and Dell extend battery life enabled, it has gone for 8 hours of light use. (like reading pdfs, and a little wireless internet use)The screen is good quality, though I find it attracts dust like nothing else. Maybe it is just that it is a fairly glossy screen, so I notice it more.The power adapter is very small, which is good. It does make some funny noises though, and it gets quite hot. Also the connection to the mains is u-shaped, so when useing the cable at maximum extent, it is smaller then the total length of cable.Performance wise, even with Windows eating a good Gig of RAM, it handles most applications quickly. I have had problems in the past with performance at the start up though - for a good 5mins after the task manager says the computer is running mostly in idle, I can take 10-15seconds to get Firefox loaded properly. Been told this is a Windows problem, and I need to format the computer. Also had problems with large MS Excel documents, though I think that is more to do with Excel being unwieldy with large amounts of data.But most of the time it runs fine. It runs Oblivion at max settings with only slight frame rate drop when there are lots of enemies on screen whilst passing into a new map area. Trackmania it runs at max, thouugh online play is limited by the host, so for that I use lower settings so not to overload other players. GTA it does struggle with. It does run it, but at medium settings at the most.At the higher performance setteings, it does get hot. The cooling fans suck air in from the bottom of the laptop on the left side. This is fine when at a desktop, but when sitting with it that happens to be where your leg is placed. The way the screen is hinged (A neat system which makes the laptop expand a bit) at maximum screen angles, the exhaust of the CPU can blow hot air up the screen. Neither are particuarly bad, but they just feel like its one of the few places where form fit over function. Long term, I hope it does not affect anything.The matt paint covering the top of the laptop is a good choice. I doesn't show fingerprints, and scratchs are hidden. Will be looking for matt coloured laptops from now on (though this one I got was red, and it does have a very pink look to it if the sun catches it wrong!)In the recent icy weather we got (Currently in Delft, Netherlands) I managed to fall of my bike a few times. One such fall the laptop got a good hit. The left hand screen join has had its cover cracked and ... thats about it. Runs fine, didn't need any help on start up, nothing. My previous laptop (also a Dell) died after a similar incident (in Scotland though). Toughness then I cannot fault.Overall, I have been very pleased with the quality and power of this system. It has not let me wrong yet, and with the eSata port/firewire and express card, it has good upgrade capibilites for the future.4/5 stars not 5 because of the problems with the fan placement, start up (though this is probably windows), power pack noises. All else is excellent. If you want a laptop which can replace a desktop and isn't too heavy and can handle pretty much everything thrown at it, get one of these. (Though try a newer one. The one with the i7 processor looks quite nice!)","Date":"December 6, 2010"}
{"Title":"Non-existent warranty","Author":"ykkst \"YKK\"","ReviewID":"R2CPS3XBO5YL3B","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this system in Hong Kong, planning to bring it the US for College. I also bought a 3-year international warranty for about US$50. The computer worked fine for one year, and then hell broke loose. First the battery refuses to hold a charge. If I plug in the computer overnight, the charge would still hold for only 50 minutes. Then the LED screen refuses to lit up when opened. I have to open and shut it for ten times before it finally registers that the screen is propped up. Lately the computer is also making loud, scratchy noises. I have tried to contact Dell to redeem my supposedly international warranty, but the database of Hong Kong and the US are not connected. You have to manually request to transfer your service tag to another country. I have tried three times doing that, and every time Dell emailed me back and say that my information cannot be verified. It doesn't help that each 'transfer' takes up to 22 days. I have concluded that Dell is not interested in honoring its warranty. Will never buy Dell again.","Date":"February 12, 2012"}

{"Title":"Good laptop if you have the patience to adjust for its quirks","Author":"Ugapug","ReviewID":"R2I8SCIGC7JJ39","Overall":"good","Content":"This laptop is powerful enough to run Star Wars:  The Old Republic at a playable framerate, so its gaming capabilities are not too shabby.  Make sure you're running the latest drivers available for it before stroking out about non-functional devices.  In particular, the HDMI out can be finicky until you realize that it needs a Realtek driver specifically for HDMI audio out AND the ATI driver for the video.Major issues:The lid/screen:  I recommend getting a piece of felt or sliding the bag the laptop comes in over just the lid area to protect the screen from the keyboard when its closed.  If you don't, you WILL get scratches on the acrylic cover over the screen.  This is a design compromise Dell took, and a bad one if you ask me.Power adapter:  If you look around for reviews of this laptop, there are a lot of unhappy folks about the way it throttles the system back, often making games and media unplayable/unwatchable.  This is 100% due to the inclusion of a 90W power adapter as shipped.  The first thing you should do is find the Dell replacement 130W adapter for this machine, (or hammer Dell support to send you one, politely mentioning \"throttling\"). This will prevent most if not all of the CPU slowdown issues.  There are other solutions, just keyword Dell XPS 1640 throttling and you'll find them.Heat:  It runs pretty warm.  This is due to the CPU/GPU sharing a heatsink and fan. Simple solution:  Get a laptop cooling pad.  Really, isn't your shiny new computer worth less than 50 bucks to keep the hardware cool?  Of course it is.Fingerprint NUCLEAR ELECTROMAGNET:  Yeah, it develops fingerprints insanely quickly.  Be prepared to wipe it down A LOT.Unless you just have to have the Dell Dock, get rid of it as soon as possible as it really slows down the system after login.All in all, it's a really nice laptop that's really pleasing aesthetically with very good performance.","Date":"January 21, 2012"}

Gorgeous display, the light-up keyboard is one of the best i have seen, and a very functional machine!My one complaint is that it heats up like crazy! Not even mentioning the underneath, i mean even the top of it! Where your wrist sits when typing gets very hot. This is a known issue with this machine. But in my opinion, its worth it. I have to question the life of a machine that runs this hot though ...I upgraded everything possible on this machine because im a frequent gamer (well, the only game i play is Warcraft...). Dont expect this machine to be a beast in there! I have to adjust in-game video settings to lowest possible, and even then im at around 2-5 FPS in 25man content ... to anyone who doesnt know, this is not even playable. The reason for this, i later found out, is the onboard vidcard. Its a very capable card for anything but gaming. Mine has the ATI Mobility card and it sucks.This might sound like a negative review but its not. Most people are not trying to game on this system, those people will love this machine to pieces.BONUS: when you buy this pc from Dell you get a \"premium\" level of service.

The dell support has been atrocious.  They delayed so long with callbacks and tests that I was out of the thirty day return policy before it was all done.  I got the two-year warranty but they refuse to take the laptop back and replace it.  It took me three months to convince them to replace the hard drive and the RAM.  Even then it took me demanding to talk to a supervisor and explaining that the computer froze on startup BEFORE reaching the Windows Startup screen and also froze whenever I tried to run check disk.I replaced the RAM and the hard drive.  That's when the random shutdowns started happening.  The computer, whether it was on battery or AC power, would just randomly shut off.  It would happen when the battery was completely removed, too.  All of the lights on the computer (the two hinge lights, the 'dashbord' lights, the light on the power button and the lights on the mouse and keyboard) just died and the computer wouldn't respond.  If I hit the power button, it would turn on again and give the 'windows did not shut down properly' so I knew it wasn't going into hibernate or some similar nonsense.  It took me four more months to convince dell that this was a real problem.  This time it took a two-hour call to tech support and demanding to talk to a supervisor, which I never got to do, for them to arrange for an on-site technician to replace the motherboard.They sent an EXCELLENT technician out, can't say enough praises about him, to replace the motherboard.  This work was done fast and the on-site technician was friendly and knowledgeable.Ever since the motherboard was replaced the computer begins to beep randomly and the sound sometimes glitches.  The beeps are incredibly distracting and I feel like I'm working on a bomb that's about to explode.  Sometimes the beeps can be stopped by blowing into the fan port...of which there is ONE.  This is a design flaw I'll go into in a moment.  The beeping is not coming from the speakers due to the fact that it continues even when the speakers have been turned off during shutdown.The laptop overheats at the drop of a hat.  Why?  Because the single fan port is COMPLETELY blocked by the screen when the laptop is open.  And I mean completely.The area the touchpad is on is a glossy black finish that shows dirt if you so much as breathe on it.  I've had to get a pair of fingerless gloves just so I can stand resting my hands on the surface, since it feels sticky and grimy after even ten minutes of use.Horribly designed, horribly made and horribly supported piece of junk.  Avoid unless you get one for free, even then, it'll be more aggravation than it's worth.","Date":"February 22, 2011"}

The first one overheated to the point of burning the stickers on the back of the unit and developed video problems. Fortunately, I had purchased a 3 year in-home warranty. After replacing the motherboard twice Dell decided they would just replace the laptop with a new one when they realized it was also overheating.  At this point I was impressed. They sent me a Studio XPS 1640 and I thought things were great.  However, 1.5 years into the second laptop it also has developed video card problems after doing some Googling I have been able to determine that the video card in the motherboard is going south on yet another unit...grrrrrr.  It also gets quite warm but not hot enough to burn the stickers on the back. Clearly the high powered video card in these XPS laptops need chillers or something to keep them from dieing a much too early death thereby killing my very expensive laptop.Frankly, if I had purchased this at a box store and paid $500-$700 bucks for it would have been easier to accept but with a $1,600.00 price tag I am not happy.

I am going into high school this year and it will be hard to do my homework and stuff quickly because  about 4-5 times this year, my computer just shut down on me in the middle of working on my homework or a major project. I can tell you that it pissed me off to no end when it did. I will have to buy a new computer that wont shut down on me and delete all my work. I recommend a different computer because soon after you buy it you will need to replace it. Hope this helped.","Date":"July 23, 2013"}

I do not recommend this machine for those of you who live in dustier locations.  There is no space between the screen and the keyboard when you close it, so if you are in a hurry and have to close it and there is dust on the screen or keyboard, the screen gets scratched up over time.  The screen is just a horrible design.  To top it off, I've had this laptop for about 3 years and the screen is now separating at the right middle edge, so now dust is actually getting behind the screen.  Other than that, I've really liked this machine.  Everything else works great, but the keyboard is now starting to fall apart, too.  The machine components just don't seem very durable for someone who uses it a lot.","Date":"February 13, 2011"}

{"Title":"Ultraportable with Excellent Performance and So-So Build Quality","Author":"Brandon","ReviewID":"RMW5NHC2TTCE2","Overall":"good","Content":"EDIT: An updated and revised review of this laptop can be found at over at Expert Laptop Review: [...]I recently went on a laptop buying rampage and have ended up with the Dell Studio 14z, HP dm3z (L625 + Radeon 4330), and the Asus UL80VT-A1 in possession all at once. The first part of this review will focus solely on the Asus UL80VT-A1 and the second part of this review will compare it with my experience with the Dell Studio 14z and the HP dm3z.ASUS UL80VT-A1 DETAILED REVIEWFirst and foremost, let me say that I ordered the UL80VT-A1 because I thought it was simply an awesome idea to have switchable graphics in a laptop because you get excellent battery life + excellent performance when needed. There were no reviews of the UL80VT out when I purchased it, so I purchased the UL80VT-A1 from [...], which has a 100 percent refund on purchases just in case things didn't work out with me and the new lady.While I was waiting to recieve the laptop in the mail, I read a review over at [...]. Oh boy, was I disappointed considering all the bad things the reviewer had to say about it (i.e. bad keyboard, bad track pad, horrible build quality, poor gaming performance). Needless to say, I had second thoughts about even opening up the Asus UL80VT-A1 because I didn't think it was worth my time considering the all the problems the reviewer had with his review model.So that morning I got my HP dm3z in the mail and was really excited about how incredibly beautiful the laptop was. It is definitely sexier (in my opinion) than every other ultraportable out there, including the Macbook Pro 13\" and HP Envy 13. I'll get to the dm3z a little later... either way, my first impression led me to believe that I'd probably be keeping the dm3z and just returning the Asus. When the Asus came in the mail, I wasn't even watching for it like I had been the dm3z. But I did take it upstairs and opened it up. (Unboxing video coming soon...)FIRST IMPRESSIONSMy first impression was astoundingly contradictory to review I had read. I picked it up, squeezed it, pushed on the keyboard, which had minimal flex that wasn't noticeable to me when typing. My other first impressions were just how well the trackpad worked. The two finger scroll worked flawlessly (though it isn't as smooth of a scroll as Apple's, it functions equally responsively and is just as useful).GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE - Rating 9/10Over the last view days, I've been taking the UL80VT-A1 out for spin in a series of gaming tests. The first game I tested was the ever popular Counter-Strike: Source. I was astounded by the computer's ability to put out 150 FPS in the stress test at native resolution of 1366x768. I had been expecting to get closer to 80-100 FPS. I then tested it with 4x AA on, and it resulted in 99 FPS, which is phenomenal considering that AA usually cripple weaker graphics cards like the Nvidia 210M.I was eager to test out the UL80VT's performance in some of the latest games because of the previous review I had read that had denounced its ability to play modern games. I had recently purchased Batman: Arkham Asylum. I loaded it up with the default settings, which were set on Very High at native 1366x768 resolution. Game play was moderately smooth and playable, but it was also noticably choppy at times with those settings (26 FPS average in the video stress test), so I dropped the settings down to medium. This time the Asus got 40 FPS average in the video stress test, and the game play was perfectly playable and smooth.I then downloaded Team Fortress 2. It has been known to give ultraportable gaming machines a tough time due to its high shader requirements. When playing, I averaged about 50-60 FPS at native resolution with everything on High with no AA. I noticed drops down to 30 FPS when in heavy action, but it was not too disruptive to game play. I don't think it went below 30 FPS during the time I played.After hearing claims that Asus UL80VT could not run Need For Speed: Shift well. I downloaded the demo to see if these claims were true. Fortunately, they were not. I was able to achieve playable frame rates, though it was a little choopy with the default settings, which had the screen at 1024x768 resolution and everything else up in detail. I tried changing the settings, but after changing the settings to lower the resolution to 800x600, the game repeatedly gave me an error and crashed right as the race was about to start. Unfortunately, I was not able to do a formal test, but it was clear that the game was getting at least 30 FPS at 800x600 resolution with texture settings on High. I would expect the game to be very playable as long as you are content with 800x600 (or maybe slightly better res) and medium settings.I also managed to squeeze in a little play time in Protoype, another recent game that was released earlier this year. It played very smoothly at the default 1280x720 (which was the max res for some reason) and on the default medium settings.Another game I was able to try was Call of Duty: World at War, which has identical specs to the latest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. People will be glad to know that I was able to achieve 35-40 FPS constant at native resolution 1366x768 with texture settings on \"normal\" (except for \"shader settings\" which I set to \"low\"). I also turned off all of the extra graphical features, which didn't make much of a difference in visuals anyway.In conclusion regarding the gaming peformance of this ultraportable laptop, it has excellent performance and handles most modern games fluidly at native resolution.BATTERY LIFE - Rating 10/10Yesterday, I used the laptop for 3 hours early in the morning with wifi on and brightness up. Later that day, I used it for about 15 minutes running Batman: AA. I then used it about 7 hours more with brightness at about 20% (2.5 hours with wifi on and 4.5 with it off). In total the laptop lasted me 10.25 hours between a mixture of wifi, gaming, and note taking/paper writing. I was extremely happy to get this excellent of performance out of it. This was precisely what I was looking for in terms of battery life.BUILD QUALITY - Rating 6/10My initial impression was that the build quality was just average--not great, but nothing bad about it either, but now after having it for a couple days, I now agree with Charles' review about some of the issues with build quality. Yesterday morning when I was typing, I noticed that when I pressed down on the front edge of the left palm rest it squeaked annoyingly (it hadn't pressed down on this part of the laptop when it was on a hard surface yet because it had always been on my laptop up until this point).I began squeezing the front edge and noticed that top part of the chassis isn't cemented to the bottom part of the chassis very well so that when you put pressure on it (such as when you rest your palm on it) it made a noise. I tried placing about an inch long piece of scotch tape across the part that was sqeaking, and the squeaking went away completely. It was disappointing to find this because it was the first issue with the build quality. Also, I now understand what Charles meant when he said that when he pressed in the center of the laptop it causes the bottom of the laptop to touch the surface it is resting on...It's not if you press in the middle of the keyboard like I had thought Charles had said (my bad!!)... it's if you press on the trackpad buttons (like Charles had really said), he was right that you can feel the laptop touch the surface it is resting on, but the thing Charles was wrong about is that it isn't the bottom of the laptop touching the surface below it... it's a little \"support peg/foot\" that protrudes from the bottom of the laptop about 1/10\" of an inch.The overall chassis does flex a tad, but it is just the peg touching, and the peg is maybe moving 1/16\" of an inch tops (probably less). So yes, the chassis does flex just a hair, but not as bad as the review makes it sound (I think the review should be updated with this information personally).I am thinking about putting a drop of super glue on the edge of the left palm rest to keep it from squeaking. I'm pretty sure it would work without a hitch unless you put too much glue and then tried to take the casing apart and wasn't able to. I figure it wouldn't void the 1 year accidental warranty but maybe the 2 year standard warranty if they figured out what I did. I'm not sure though... I figure you can always \"cut through\" the glue so that the chassis can be opened if you needed to send it in for repairs.I also noticed that the entire surface (including the aluminum top) acquires fingerprints. I was disappointed that the aluminum top also was prone to oils from my fingers.HEAT MANAGEMENT - Rating 10/10The heat on this bad-boy is hardly noticeable. I think more heat is generated because it is restricting the airflow over your lap more than anything. Whenever my lap started to feel a little warm, I would feel the bottom of the laptop but the bottom of the laptop never got hot. It was always just the fact that my legs weren't getting as much air to cool them down.I was also able to play Batman:AA while on my lap just fine, though it was starting to be mildly uncomfortable by the time 30 mins rolled around. Still, as far as gaming on the lap goes, I think it would be doable, and far more doable than on any other laptop I have ever tried.This laptop is by far the coolest running laptop I have ever owned (I've owned about 14 different laptops...). For this reason, I give it a 10/10 in heat management.KEYBOARD - Rating 8/10Overall, I find the keyboard to be a little above average. I do not like the fact that there are no keys dedicated to playing and pausing music. To access media controls, you must hold the FN button down and tap the arrow keys (down arrow = play/pause). I do not notice any flex when typing. The primary concern that I had was from the squeaky palm rest edge when typing. After I fixed that issue, the keyboard became quite pleasant to use.TRACK PAD - Rating 9/10I find the track pad to be the best track pad I have ever used on a PC. It does have a glossy surface, but I did not find that the surface was not nearly as sticky as the surface on many HPs (including the dm3z). I also found the trackpad to be responsive and that the multitouch gestures such as two-finger scrolling to work perfectly nearly every time.The ELAN touch pad has configurable options to enable you to change the sensitivity of the two-finger scroll as well as enable you to use two and three finger taps to do customizable actions. I have my two-finger tap to do a right click and my three-finger tap to show my desktop.My only complaint regarding the touch pad is that the uni-button. The uni-button looks like only one button, but has a left side and right side that makes up two buttons. When the uni-button was pressed towards the middle, it was very difficult to click, but if you pressed it near the ends the button became more usable. This was also the case with the Acer Timeline 4810t that I had owned for some time. I have found that the tap to click function is very usable, especially since I can just use two fingers if I need to right click. Therefore, I hardly use the button anymore anyway. My system works just fine.OVERALL VERDICT - Rating 9/10Despite its (fixable) flaws in build quality and poor touch pad button (again just use \"tap to click\" instead), I'm still impressed with laptop and can definitely recommend it to friends who aren't particularly picky about build quality. The UL80VT-A1 will provide the performance most casual gamers want in a portable package that has a very long battery life and is inexpensive compared to similar models. [Oh, wait, scratch that...  There has never been anything like the UL80VT-A1 to ever come out before... except maybe the Acer Timeline 3810TG that had switchable graphics, but that computer was only available in the UK. ]COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION (DELL STUDIO 14Z and HP DM3Z)I have now owned a Dell Studio 14z for about two months. I also purchased a HP dm3z, which I had originally planned on writing a review of but I don't know if I'll find the time. Maybe I'll just do a video review...Anyway, the HP dm3z initially impressed me tremendously with its fantastic metal looks and thin profile. However, two issues became immediately apparent that prevented me from considering the laptop further: the HP dm3z produced a tremendous amount of heat even while just idling (the bottom got roasting hot while playing games... though the palm rests stayed pretty cool) and I quickly became frustrated by track pad lag and malfunctioning two-finger scrolling. The problem with the two finger scroll is due to the fact that it does not always register that you are actually using two fingers, therefore, it thinks you only have one finger down and shoots your mouse all the way across the screen where you didn't want it to go.Beside the two-finger scroll I noticed minimal track pad lag (though there was lag). The track pad was definitely usable and should not prevent someone entirely from purchasing it for that sole reason, but after trying out the UL80VT's track pad and comparing the two. It was night and day. The UL80VT's was immediately responsive and the two-finger scrolling worked perfectly pretty much all the time. I have sorely missed two-finger scrolling since getting rid of my Macbook Pro a year ago. I am very glad that PCs are starting to make it standard on the majority of notebooks today. Unfortunately, the HP dm3z did not have good enough drivers to make the two-finger scrolling worthwhile.One thing that I really liked about the dm3z is that it had an excellent keyboard with zero flex and it included media control buttons for the function keys (like Dell Studio 14z). I would definitely recommend the dm3z to people as long as you understand that it is going to produce a lot of heat (especially while watching video/playing games), the track pad is just going to be so-so, and you aren't going to achieve the same battery life you would if you went with the UL80VT (unless you went with the intel version with integrated graphics).I began searching for a new laptop shortly after I found paint chipping on my Dell Studio 14z. It was frustrating since I try to take excellent care of my laptops and chipped paint tends to bring the resale value of laptops down tremendously. All in all, I found my experience with the 14z to be a good one and would recommend the laptop to someone who has a strict budget and can't afford a UL80VT.With the dell, I was typically able to get about 3.5-4.5 hours of battery life (8-cell in windows 7) while surfing the internet-writing documents. The HP dm3z seems to get about 4.5 hrs of web surfing time. The Asus literally doubles the length of my time I am going to be away from the wall (with both the HP and the Dell...).My primary complaints with the Dell Studio 14z were related to the build quality (paint chipping and noticeable keyboard flex that was causing me discomfort). I loved the back-lit keyboard and will miss that feature on the UL80VT, though I am a touch typist so it will make little difference in terms of actual functionality.I love the fact that my UL80VT has a DVD-RW because I like to watch DVDs at Starbucks that I rent from Redbox. I couldn't do that with the 14z because it lacked an optical drive, but I can do that with the Asus.It should also be noted that the UL80VT has a better screen than both the Dell and the HP (in my opinion).IN CONCLUSIONAfter I discovered the flex, I began contemplating switching over to a Macbook Pro 13\". So I went to my local Best Buy to compare sizes, keyboard, touchpad, etc... I got to the store and there was a bestbuy sales guy there that I got to know pretty well when I bought my Dell Studio 14z. I began explaining to him how the 14z hadn't met my needs due to a sucky touch pad and paint chipping off for no reason, etc. I pulled my UL80VT out of my bag and explain to him the features of the laptop (i.e. switchable graphics, 10 hour battery life). I loaded up Batman Arkham Asylum and he was amazed that it played smoothly at native resolution. I showed him squeaky palm rest and explained to him I was considering getting a 13\" Macbook Pro. He responded pretty quickly that he didn't think that apple would have anything that would be an upgrade from this so just recommended that I just stick with the Asus... (lol and he's a sales guy that is supposed to sell laptops for best buy, not recommend for me not to buy them... lol)I agree with the guy at Best Buy. Apple's got nothing on the Asus UL80VT... except maybe better build quality, poorer performance, and a $500 dollar increase in price. Hint: get the Asus, unless build quality is of utmost importance to you.I'm sorry that this review was so scatter-brained. I like to keep things more organized, but I also just wanted to get this review posted!!","Date":"November 4, 2009"}
{"Title":"Best Laptop Ever! My first review! Cuz it rocks that much!","Author":"M. Hwang","ReviewID":"R3IP7YS7J059YE","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't usually spend my time putting in reviews because it doesn't benefit me much (I know, kind of selfish) but this product was just too good to not leave a review, especially since there's no review here yet.I've been looking at laptops for years now, always looking for the one that hits all the sweet spot. I didn't NEED it so I was able to just keep waiting for the right one. Here were all the things I was looking for.Fast speed - For gaming like World of Warcraaft, etc.Long battery life - It's not mobile if you're chained to power cord.Decent price - Nobody should be paying more than a grand for a laptop.Temperature - This is something many people don't think much about until too late. Laptops get HOT, and then they're no longer LAPtop, but a DESKtop.DVD drive - Because I like to keep my options open.Every laptops I've seen through deal sites, etc NEVER met all of these criteria. Until now. This computer really is THE laptop to get right now.Pros-------------Great speed - I just ran World of Warcraft and it runs SMOOTH with mid-high setting. I also saw from another review that this can run Farcry2 or Crysis2 at 40fps which is pretty damn good.LED screen - This takes some getting used to since I'm not used to seeing such rich black on monitor but it looks bright, crisp, and shiny. (latter might be issue if you live with many light fixtures)Video - YES it has Nvidia video card on top of Intel integrated. This allows for awesome gaming which many other laptops just can't do.Temperature - It doesn't burn! :D  It still gets warm, especially on left side near vent but it's not so hot that I have to put something underneath to shield my lap like previous laptops I had.Weight - I'm kinda scrawny guy and I can lift this with one hand with no issue. This will be handy as you move around the house or carry in yer bag.Battery life - AWESOME. just check any other review on this because they'll all tell you this thing last a loong time. It was tough to find laptops that can last long WHILE also having great performance AND be under a grand. Now there is.ExpressGate - It allows you to turn on a laptop from off or hibernation mode, into special operating system that has skype, photo, and web browser among others. So if you need to google something quick, now you can! There's downside to that in cons section.Cons----------------------Keyboard - This is very minor annoyance but I want to be thorough. When you type, sometimes, you hear this light metal ringing-ish sound that's coming from metal underneath the keyboard. It's not the quietest keyboard you'll use but it won't drive you crazy either.Touchpad - I had to figure out the issue with this because it was bugging the hell out of me. It has two and three finger gestures like scroll and right/middle click. Issue was it wasn't accurate and working sporadically. Scroll especially was driving me nuts because it'll scroll at its own speed/time. I tried pressing my fingers lightly/heavily but difference. Then I figured it out. You have to have you movement straight up and down or left/right. When people use the touchpad, we usually have our hand in an angle so we end up scrolling in almost like \\ instead of |. Well, touchpad doesn't like that. Same goes for right/middle click that requires 2-3 fingers. It works best if you have your fingers in same x axis. Some people won't be affected since they'll use mouse but if you'll be using touchpad a lot, be prepared for bit of adjustment. Oh, and if you prefer to click the button instead of tapping the touchpad for mouse clicks, exercise your finger because button's bit harder to press than other touchpad buttons I've used.ExpressGate - Idea is great. Execution, not quite. I was expecting instant on like when you come out of sleep mode but unfortunately, there's still some wait involved. 10-ish seconds I believe. Also, Asus installed regular monitor version of expressgate onto this widescreen laptop so everything's stretched to fit widescreen. So far, I haven't figured out how to change resolution in this mode. It's good for quick browsing but not for long session.Power cable - OMG, where do ASUS think people live in? Castles!? Power cord is the longest I've ever seen. About 10-11 ft total (big power block right in the mid point). And although it comes with velcro strip to manage the cable, I found there's too much cable to roll the cable neatly. Just prepare for some mess when packing cable. Good thing this has 10 hour battery life so you won't have to deal with cable too much.All in all, Pros are all important crucial items and Cons are minor annoyance at best. This is really the best laptop you could get at this price with this much features and performance. I remember coming across Sony and HP that had similarity (good speed, light weight, dvd) and those were going for 1800ish.. and it didn't even have 10hr battery life. If you don't believe me, when you go out for laptop shopping, just have this computer's feature written down and compare. You ain't gonna find one that beats it easily.EDIT:Couple things I came across after prolonged use.1. It does get hot, especially near vent but only when I'm using it intensely like 3d games. but it doesn't get hot on the surface much. Just underneath near vent.2. Changing performance mode requires you to quit any apps that use video card, such as Photoshop, games, etc. So change before you load them. Otherwise, when you press the button to change the power mode, nothing happens.3. OMG FINGERPRINT MAGNET. EVERYWHERE. >.<Still loving it though.","Date":"October 31, 2009"}
{"Title":"Just plain awesome!","Author":"z1Ryan","ReviewID":"R2UMRJCHDDH01X","Overall":"good","Content":"I have never written a review of any kind, not that I don't come across good products or service, but it's like the next item on one's list which one never gets to.  However, the ul80vt-a1 is just too awesome a laptop that after one week of ownership, I am still jumping up and down like a little puppy, given my typical enthusiasm normally lasts no more than 48 hours.By the time you read my review, you've already known all the good things about this laptop -- very long battery life, fast performance, cool to touch, bright screen with sharp resolution, clear and loud speakers, thin and light weight in spite of the presence of an optical drive, fast to boot.  The list goes on and on, and it is all true.  By the way, there is one item I haven't seen mentioned yet -- the battery charges extremely fast without getting hot.  And no, I don't work for Asus.  In fact, before I started researching for a good laptop to buy, I didn't even know who or what Asus was, and I still cannot pronounce its name.But what makes me so happy is that all the bad things I heard in these reviews are also not true.  Not every single feature is perfect.  There are some items one can fault with, but they really amount to nothing.  This is what I want everyone to know so one doesn't gloss over this great laptop because someone out there doesn't like the feel of the keyboard.1. Regardless of what other people said, the build quality of my laptop is very high, no different from the HP's, the Dell's and the Lenovo's I have owned.  No, it is not flimsy, and everything snaps correctly with no gap or sharp edge.2. The keyboard is fine.  It does not feel the same as a Lenovo, but it doesn't flex like others say either.  It's just that the keys are not as bouncy, so they feel a little bit soft.3. Some reviewers mentioned the screen does not have sharp contrast.  It is true when the brightness is set on high, the screen may look a little washed out, but it's not something you cannot solve by tilting the screen a little up or down.  By the way, reflection from the glossy screen is not an issue, to my surprise, and you can see fine outdoor.4. The touch pad arguably is the worst feature on this laptop.  It is more sticky than one with a matte finish, and once in a while you will go out of boundary without realising it.  The large single touch pad button below is positioned awkwardly and is quite honestly hard to press because the frame the button is set in is in the way.  The touch pad one can get used to; the button, highly questionable.5. Yes, fingerprints do show up, but they can be readily wiped off without much fanfare.  However, if you like having a bag of greasy chips in one hand and use the computer with the other, this laptop can be a problem for you.  On the other hand, it may help one kick one's junk food addiction.6. So far I have two minor problems.  Both are related to switching the power management mode:6a. When I plug and unplug from the power cord, the screen does black out for a couple of seconds, unlike other laptops I've owned.  Furthermore, sometimes when the screen comes back on, it will flicker when I mouse over something on the screen.  The only remedy I have found so far is to close the application (IE 8 in my case) and start it again.6b. When I press the Graphix Boost button, it changes the time zone automatically to pacific time (GMT-8).  I haven't tried changing through the power management tool by selecting any of the Power4Gear options, but it probably will change the time zone just the same.  It's minor to change the time zone back, provided you notice something is wrong with the time.I genuinely think there is more than a good chance you will be very happy with the laptop.  I know I am.p.s. If reliability is important to you, a Nov 2009 study published by SquareTrade on the 3 year reliability records of 30,000 laptops from 9 vendors ranked Asus at the top.

{"Title":"Perfect for college","Author":"King","ReviewID":"R1WMM5L3VWWC5M","Overall":"good","Content":"I went through a long, 6-month search before I finally settled on the ASUS UL80Vt.  As a college student, I had many seemingly contradictory criterion.  I wanted:- Core 2 Duo processor and 4GB of RAM, for general productivity- Long battery life, for working on campus and in class- Decent portability, for carrying it around all the time- Discrete graphics, for the occasional game- CD Drives, USB ports and HDMI, because connectivity is importantLike any college student, I looked at MacBooks, Dells and the idea of a netbook/desktop setup, but for the net $720 I got this computer for, the ASUS UL80Vt blew them away. On to the review...PRODUCTIVITY SPEED: 8/10A little technical note: At stock speeds, the Core2Duo SU7300 is a 1.3 GHz processor with a 800Mhz FSB.  Asus overclocks this to a 1.73 GHz on a 1066Mhz FSB, matching the 4GB of DDR3 DRAM.  For those who, like me, were deciding between this and laptops with faster processors, you will not notice the difference with most software.  Microsoft Office works like a charm, even on massive Excel financial models and graphic presentations.  Web browsing is quick even with the 11 tabs I have open right now.  The only time I've noticed faster Core 2 Duos matter was on extracting large RAR files, and even then the difference is less than a minute for a 4GB file.PHYSICAL PORTABILITY: 7/10Definitely heavier and larger than I expected.  The 14-inch screen is balanced with a decent bezel on the top and bottom.  The 8-cell battery weighs a lot more than it looks.  However, it is definitely smaller and lighter than the MacBook Pro.  It is also very thin, topping at slightly more than 1 in.  It weighs in at 4.74 lbs., and I would say is actually light for its power.  However, this is not as much a Thin-and-Light as others in its class, so do adjust your expectations.BATTERY LIFE: 11/10Incredible battery life.  On integrated graphics, I regularly get 9 hours with 30% brightness, overclocked and WLAN on, surfing the web and taking notes.  11.5 hours may actually be realistic without the overclocking or WLAN.  I've watched two full-length 720p movies and still had 25% left.  On the discrete graphics, you can get 3 hours of solid gaming before you're drained.  This blows netbooks, MacBooks, Dells, etc. away.  Simply unbelievable.GAMING: 8/10This laptop has both integrated Intel graphics and a discrete nVidia G210M with 512MB of memory.  I have mine slightly overclocked, and it gets 4000 points on 3DMark06 with the discrete card. Can play Dragon Age, Civilization 4, Sims 3, NBA 2K9, Warcraft III and WoW with at least medium settings at native resolution.  This is probably not important to most people but I love having the flexibility to play games or play movies more smoothly with the discrete graphics.  This is not a gaming rig, but can play most modern games well enough.PORTS AND CONNECTIVITY: 8/10It has a DVD SuperDrive (burns DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, Double-Layer), 3 USB ports, an Ethernet port, a 4-in-1 memory card reader (MMC, SD, MS/MS Pro), and HDMI port, a VGA port, a microphone jack and a mic jack.  It also has a 0.3 megapixel webcam and mic integrated.  There's an integrated b/g/n WLAN solution, although it is not as strong as the Intel ones.  A solid selection, especially on such a thin laptop.  The only gripes here are the lack of eSATA and Bluetooth.WARRANTY & SUPPORT: 10/102 year limited warranty with 1 year of accidental damage protection.  Most laptops just come with 1 year of limited warranty.  In general, extended warranties are not worth the cost, but in this case it's a welcome plus.  Asus has also been very helpful with a solid support site and staff who answer questions even here.TEMPERATURE: 10/10Does not burn your lap.  Stays very very cool.  Right now the CPU is at about 98F, hard drives at 104F and the ACPI is at 118F.  On load, CPU hits 130F and the GPU's have hit 180F, but still feels very cool to the touch.  Can get a bit warm near the fan area on full load, but normally the fan doesn't even need to turn.  The fan is also very quiet; even on max load it only has a soft hum.Finally... to address some common gripesBUILD QUALITY: 6/10Definitely the weak point of this computer.  Quality is not as subpar as most reviewers would have it--most laptops not called ThinkPads have some flex and give--but definitely give.  The bezel is not entirely cemented to the screen, and there's a lot of give right below the screen.  Keyboard flex is fine by itself; it seems extreme when you're on a desk, but that's because the entire chassis flexes when it's slightly raised.  That in itself is the bigger problem.  On the bottom, the two chassis halves are not cemented well together, and there is some give there.  I bought a padded laptop sleeve which seems to protect it fine.  I would not put too much weight on the keyboard when it's on a desk (as opposed to on your lap).DISPLAY: 8/10To be fair, it's a standard 1366x768 screen, plays 720p videos fine.  It's a very bright LED screen, and can outshine the outdoors even though the screen is very glossy.  The noted contrast problems are really a device driver problem; on integrated graphics, contrast will sometimes decrease noticeably, perhaps in a play to reduce necessary brightness.  On discrete graphics, great contrast, sharp screen.AUDIO: 7/10Altec Lansing speakers located on the bottom of the front of the chassis.  By no means audiophile-quality at all, but much better than most laptop speakers.  You will sometimes block the speakers while it's on your lap, but in general distortion is lower than in, for example, ThinkPads, and volume is better than a Mac's.In conclusion, I am highly satisfied with this purchase.  If there were better speakers and better build quality, I would award this product 10/10, but as of now I am willing to rate it a 9/10 and round up.  Amazon was also very helpful; I was allowed to still purchase through the $100 Gift Card promotion even after the link stopped working.For those interested in the next generation, the UL80Jt incorporates a low-voltage dual-core Core i7 overclocked to 1.73 Ghz and an nVidia 310M with 1GB.  It promises even better performance and battery life, but will clock in at just over $1,000.","Date":"January 19, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great laptop, ok display","Author":"James","ReviewID":"R30X06TVI5VT5V","Overall":"good","Content":"This is also my first review of a product.  I was really looking forward to this laptop and when I received it and turned it on I was pretty disappointed.  The display on this laptop is very poor.  The contrast ratio is low, so everything looks a little washed out.  Its not terrible and would be tolerable but the horizontal viewing angle is horrible!  You have to get the angle perfect to make the display look acceptable.  If you move it slightly towards or away from you, it looks discolored and is pretty much unusable.  I have owned several laptops over the last couple years from a 13 dell xps to 18.4 inch hp hdx and I have never had a problem with or complained about a display before.  I've never even considered examining a display because I'm not that picky, but that was the first thing (and only thing really) that stood out through all of my time using the laptop.  The only reason I'm writing this review is to caution people about the display.  If it is not that important to you than this is a great laptop.  It's speedy, fairly well made, great battery life, relatively thin and light, and windows 7 rocks.  If the display was better it would get 5 stars.  If I had the choice to return this laptop for a full refund I would, only because of the display.NOTE: I also have asus eee pc 105ha and it has a much better display than this laptop for contrast and viewing angles.**UPDATE**  I feel the need to clarify this because I have received a few comments with tips or information about this display.  I have owned and used many laptops of all brands, price ranges, manufacturers etc... This is a BAD display, it's not just my subjective opinion.  Here is a link with actual data on the subject= [...]I'm not saying this laptop is bad, I gave it three stars, but Asus absolutely skimped on the display!","Date":"November 4, 2009"}
{"Title":"Ordinary Average Guy","Author":"M","ReviewID":"RI4QUXHRE64MW","Overall":"good","Content":"Edit: 5/18/2011Bought this rig in the first month or so it was released, so now almost 2 years into ownership (okay, maybe year and a half). Asus has won me over in terms of hardware reliability and build quality. Not sure what the negative reviews are about, mine has consistently run quiet and cool. So much so that I am now revisiting my review to update on how much I enjoy owning this machine.>>> Original Post <<<Im an average computer user, a few years out of college and work in finance... I use my computer to check email, watch movies, edit photos (with gimp) and light gaming. I was looking for something that fits in a weekend backpack, has good battery life for travel layovers and handles anything I throw at it.I've had my UL80VT for a week now and so far not overly impressed, but still very happy with the purchase... I havent experienced the loose construction others have mentioned in the plastic, but the keyboard does have a good amount of flex and sounds a bit tinny. Not too bad, but noticeable. I also nearly cut my hand on a sharp corner of the aluminum lid, and now that I know its there I'll avoid grabbing it from the corner. The build quality of the HP EliteBook I use for work far surpasses the feel of this, but then this is a fraction of the price...My biggest complaint is the lack of dedicated media buttons. The volume is adjusted with Fn+F10 through Fn+F12, too long a stretch for one hand... Lame... Speaker quality is otherwise very good, plenty of the subtleties shine through the music and very little background noise at max volume.Battery life showing 9 hours and 30 minutes now, and has been unplugged for about 30 minutes. I have the TURBO (overclocking) turned ON and discrete graphics turned OFF. It is easy to turn the graphics back on and doing so causes battery life to go down to 5 hours and 30 minutes. Totally acceptable, if not impressive at 512mb. Boot-up is very quick and Win 7 with all aesthetic features turned on runs flawlessly.I dont own/play a lot of video games, but I do enjoy the Battlefield series. Battlefield Heroes plays flawlessly with the discrete graphics on and still acceptable without. Im impressed by the commercials for the new Call of Duty and will probably buy it this weekend since Im confident this rig can handle it.The black aluminum looks sophisticated. I dont mind the fingerprint magnet of the shiny plastic and the subtle blue accents are a very nice touch.The trackpad is very responsive and accurate... Took a day or so to get enough finger oil on the plastic to keep from feeling sticky, and now that I've \"broken it in\" am very happy with the feel. My only complaint here is the seamless integration into the case. While typing it's way too easy for my palm to wonder onto the trackpad and move the cursor. There's an option to reduce the sensitivity to \"palm touches\", which has helped but not eliminated the problem.I am MOST IMPRESSED by the Asus rep reading the forums here. I hope their service center is as responsive (but hopefully I'll never need to call).Overall first impression, great machine with a few obvious design flaws. Not enough to ruin the experience, but does make you think why they were overlooked.So, I was waiting for a CULV with a backlit keyboard, but my Dell suddenly stopped working due to a motherboard problem. I'm not a vindictive person, but I really hope somebody reads this and decides not to buy a dell. They claim to have fixed the problem under warranty (by replacing the monitor?) and wont even answer my calls since I'm now a month out of warranty. Dell service has kicked dirt in my eyes in a very spiteful way.As an average user with plenty of laptop experience, I'm happy to answer any questions within my range of knowledge.EDIT: 11-22-2010Just recieved my computer back from the ASUS service center. The fan started clicking a while ago as if it had a broken bearing. Also I mentioned to them the squeaky plastic (which surfaced about 2 months into ownership). Took about 2 weeks to recieve the computer back and the fan is fixed, but the plastic is still squeaking. Seems like they replaced it which leads me to believe it is a defect in the design.That said, I recently replaced the hard drive with a 7200 rpm, 500 gb Hitachi. Win7 startup feels slightly faster, but the real improvement is in decibals... This laptop is dead silent, even when transferring 20 gb from one partition to another. When the fan eventually kicks in (which is rare with my usage), it is still surprisingly quiet. Battery life is still at 10 hrs web surfing and about 7 hours watching movies with the graphics off. With the graphics on it is about 4.5 hours watching movies and 2.5 hrs playing Battlefield. All in all, one year later and my UL80vt is even faster and quieter than the day I received it. Very happy with the machine, but the touchpad design is still iritating as I still havent found a decent fix for \"palm touches\".","Date":"November 21, 2009"}
{"Title":"Stuff thats different out about this laptop...","Author":"kentpaul_65102 \"Kent Paul\"","ReviewID":"R26C7NRCVZ88W","Overall":"good","Content":"What I was looking for: I set out to find a laptop that was light, decent graphics and screen for gaming and watching HD movies, powerful enough to run video-editing and image-editing software, and a good battery life for times in an international airport where all the power jacks look alien to you and you don't feel like dropping $15 on a gadget you are going to use once in your life. I wanted a laptop that wasn't a gaming laptop per say, but could handle the needs of the occasional gamer. It should also have all the basic peripherals like ample USB, VGA and an optical drive. I also wanted to have an HDMI output for my optimal viewing pleasure on big screens. I also wanted the weight to be around 4 pounds and the screen around 14 inches which can be classified as a thin and light laptop. My budget was around $1000.resources used prior to purchase:notebookreview, pcmag, notebookcheck, laptopmag, engadget, washingtonpost, anandtech, youtubeWhy I chose the Asus UL80VTMajor reasons:512 NVidia G210M graphics card: This spec. is very likely to go under-appreciated by the majority of the people who read this, but if you are an occasional gamer like me, this can easily handle games of today like Call of Duty 2 Modern Warfare under regular settings. You can also watch HD movies 720p and not experience any lag. The aero theme is beautifully rendered on the desktop. When this part of the computer is being used, this is the only time you will experience hot air coming from the left side of the keyboard. Other than that, the notebook is completely safe in your lap. It also has integrated graphics, which is the default. The switch to NVidia graphics is only a touch of a button.14.1\" LED screen: The LED technology takes a whole lot of weight off the laptop and also enables the thickness of lid to be extremely thin. This is one of the best screen I have ever used it is truly HD and watching movies is sheer pleasure. Because it's glossy, it is bound to attract fingerprints easily, but this should not be a deterrent because you should not being touching your screen, even by mistake... unless it's a touch-screen monitor.Battery Life: It is more like 10 hours give or take with wireless and some occasional video streaming. If you are only doing office type work, you can surely go beyond 10 hours. Gaming will give you about 4 or 5 hours depending on the game. My LAN sessions do not go for more than 3 hours at a sitting so I don't have to lug my power gear when I am playing at a friend's place.ULV processor and memory: If you haven't being paying attention to the 'thin and light' notebook market, this is the new standard. Less is more in terms of battery life and less heat production. Even though it has a 1.3 ghz processor, the Core 2 Duo and the 4 gb of memory combo packs quite a big punch. I have never experienced any major lags while running multiple applications.64-bit: While majority of the today's processors are based on 32 bit architecture, this is the next step up. A 64 bit machine is more capable of using of the two RAM modules than a 32  bit machine, this helps a lot when you are using applications that require a lot of memory like video editing or gaming. You can definitely notice the speed at which it boots. Applications that run in the 64bit mode will result increase in performance but the problem is that not all application are available in the 64 bit mode. (For example, VLC does not have a 64 bit compiler yet and the 32 bit version has a bug that turns all applications into VLC players which is very annoying. If you are looking for a good alternative to VLC, Media Player Classic x64 is a winner.)Warranty: two year warranty with a one year accidental warranty included! usually you have one year warranty but this is extremely outrageousPrice: When I was looking towards buying a laptop, its top competitors were prices from $1100 so $823 was a steal! With all the given features of this notebook, the free $100 Amazon giftcard sealed the deal.Minor quirksExpressgate: fast linux OS which can start in under 10 seconds. I dont really ever use it because Windows 7 boots in about a minute. And that if I needed to quickly go online, the iPod touch is always active.Ice cool palm rest: this should be refuted the moment you read it. Makes you think, that there is a cooling system included, especially for the palm rest. Let's just say it is never hot from the internal parts.Fingerprints: Like the glossy screen, the lid is too is prone to oily fingers. But this does not bother me too much because I spend most of my time staring at the screen, not the lid.Touchpad: My least favorite part of this product is probably the touch pad. It is built in into the palm rest and it made from the same material with multiple grooves to give it some definition. There is a lot of friction when you use it, and feels much slower because of that. I have increased the sensitivity but there was no major improvement. This is not only the worst part of this laptop but it qualifies for the worst touchpad ever designed! But once again, no problem because I hardly ever use it, the ultra-responsive laser mouse is mightier than any touchpad!Speakers: Even though it's built-in speakers might be better than many laptops it cannot compete with even an okay external speaker or headphones.Other RecommendationsI wish they had included a Blu-ray player, and I wouldn't mind paying a little more for that, it would then be a formidable media centerBottom line: This laptop can go head to head with the whatever best of 2009 or top lists you can muster. It will be a sure winner, in performance and in price, which is very surprising. The difference between this laptop and the average one all lies under the hood. It may not look like an Apple, but it surely looks most of the pc laptops. It performance can rival the Macbook Pro any day, not an overstatement... I mean with Windows 7, what is the use of a Macbook?","Date":"December 28, 2009"}
{"Title":"Absolutely one of the best laptops I've ever purchased!","Author":"John F.","ReviewID":"RPB9ZF4KZI09E","Overall":"good","Content":"Before I begin, just let me say that I am an IT/IS professional and have been in the business for over 20 years.  To say that I have owned MANY laptops over the course of my career would be an understatement.  This is the 12th laptop I have purchased and I am SO impressed with it's performance that I had to write a review.I've been using (over the last couple of years) a 13-inch MacBook and a couple of different Windows-based laptops.  As much as I love OS X, in my line of work, some of the tools that I really need on a day-to-day basis only exist in a Microsoft world, and therefore I had to resign myself to the fact that I was going to have to get a Windows laptop.  But, my career has taken me into a position where I work overseas quite often, and the issues of portablity and long battery life are now of great importance to me as well.I began looking with several criteria in mind that a prospective laptop would have to meet in order to be ideal for my use:- LONG battery life (at least 6 hours or better)- NO NETBOOKS (if I wanted a cripled processor, I could certainly find one at the corner store)- 4 gb ram (always want more if I can find it, but I wasn't willing to trade off weight or battery life to go beyond the 4 gb cap)- light!! (If you have ever had to pack for a month at a time and plan for 16-hour plane trips, you can certainly appreciate this)- Windows 7, upgradable to UltimateThere are other things that I looked for as well, but those were the main points.  Originally, I started looking at the new Viao series (I think it's the \"W\" series).  I've always had misgivings about Sony laptops because, over the years, I've seen people shell out large amounts of cash for these, only to find out later that when they want to upgrade their operating system, Sony just does not write drivers for all of their hardware and they are essentially stuck with the laptop in its original configuration until they are ready to go buy another one.  Well, this time, Sony has even outdone itself, as the new super-light models come with Home Premium edition and CANNOT BE UPGRADED TO ANY OTHER WINDOWS 7 RELEASE!!  I found several sites with many people complaining about this, and it just completely pushed me away from even considering any of the Sony models.When I started to add my criteria that I listed above, there were only a couple of models that even started to meet all the specs; IBM had a couple (and I've owned a ThinkPad in the past and loved it), and my favorite laptop manufacturer, Toshiba, had a couple as well.  But, in looking at those further, the battery life was JUST above where I wanted it (6 hours), which means that I'd be lucky to get 4-5 out of them in actual use.These Asus branded laptops kept popping up though as I continued to search.  I knew of Asus from their desktop component parts (motherborads, etc.), but I had never really even looked into their laptops before now.  But, the more I read, the more impressed I became as their claims of 11-12 hour battery life and many positive reviews kept coming the more I looked.  Not to mention the fact that they were absolutely the most inexpensive laptops considering the features that they were offereing.  I figured at these prices, even if it bombed on me, I wouldn't be out too much money!As I narrowed down my choices, I was torn between the 13.3\" and the 14\" models.  My MacBook was only 13.3\" and it had been just fine to work on as far as size of the screen and keyboard.  But, there were two features on the 14\" model that just sold me on it (aside from the fact that it was only about $100 more):- integrated optical drive -- I know this is not a deal-breaker for a lot of people, but I really enjoy having one on-board rather than another piece of crap I have to keep up with in my carry-on.  And, it only adds 1 pound to the total weight of the device!- switchable graphics -- this just blew my mind... not only would I be able to throtle down the processor when I needed, but I could even switch over to a lower power-cosuming graphics mode to get MORE juice out of the batery??So, I ordered the black 14\" unit to be delivered for when I was returning home from one of my overseas trips.  When I called my wife from my last layover before returing to my home airport, she informed me that \"another one of my toys had been delivered\" (smile).  I should tell you at this point that I DID order a 750 gb WD hard drive to replace the 320 gb that is supplied with the unit.  I would rather have as much of my stuff as I can on an internal drive as opposed to having to dig for another piece of crap in my carry-on (I know... I'll get off that soapbox!).When I unpaced the unit, I was immeidately impressed with its appearance and design, not to mention the fact that it actually weighed LESS than my 13.3\" MacBook!  I powered it up, and the battery (which had about a 40% charge when I opened it) charged in LESS THAN AN HOUR!  I immediately created the restoration DVDs and replaced the factory hard drive with no problems to speak of.I've been using this for about 3 weeks now and just can't say enough about how good this laptop is.  For those of you who used MacBooks, the chicklet-style keyboard and trackpad will be VERY easy to become accustomed to.  The trackpad two-finger movements are not as accurate or refined as Apple's, but, if you want that, go buy an Apple :)  Otherwise, for a Windows based laptop, it's really good.The screen is just fine as fas as resolution and clairty goes.  It's not a matte screen, so don't expect it to show out in direct sunlight; but, as far as day-to-day use goes, it's just fine and on-par with any other lsptop out there.  Overall performance is just fine as well, with minimal lag in program start time and performance.  I did make note that although the \"SpeedBoot\" is turned on, I really don't see THAT big of a difference in startup times (if that's really important to you).  But, wake time from hibernation and sleep are really pretty fact.The battery life is AWSOME :)  I mean, let's face it... for a sub-$1000 laptop, even the claim of 11.5 hours of battery life seems outlandish.  However, I ran this poor thing with only the brightness turned down (not the processor) for almost 8 hours and STILL had about 15-20% left.  As far as my 16-hour plane trips go, I also have an external battery (check out \"batterygeek\" if you're intrested) that can usually give me about an extra 4-5 hours on a convential laptop; this guy managed to get a FULL RECHARGE while I was sleeping for a couple of hours and I STILL had some juice left in my portable.Before I go, I wanted to comment on a few of the negative points I'd seen in other reviews, as they made me think very hard about buying this unit (when I shouldn't have had to):- fingerprint magnet -- ABSOLUTELY.... it looks like I could run my own crime lab off the surface of this thing sometimes.  But... you know what???  THEY WIPE OFF!!!  If something like this deters you from buying this model, then you really need to be looking for a laptop that has \"JUICY\" stamped across the back of it and has the option to come with bedazzling finish of not.....- flexing keyboard -- WHAT??  Do all the people out there complaining about this problem type with the same force that Mike Tyson punches with???  I just don't see what people are complaining about here... it's a LAPTOP.... not a tool bench.  If you expect that it will take you beating your fist on top of it when you loose a game of Bejewed on-line, then, again, maybe the \"JUICY\" model would be more up your alley....- trackpad issues -- ok, I can't beat up on people too much about this one, becaue using a MacBook teaches you how to use two-fingered scrolling and only have a single button to click with.  But, just like most of us did when mice and trackpads first showed up... we LEARNED!  Granted, maybe I'm seeing the benefit of driver and/or firmware upgrades, but again, that is NO reason at all not to use these laptops.  I can't say that I've had ANY problems with mine from the start.Bottom line here is that for business or casual users who what something light wiht a long battery life and don't want to buy a netbook with little or no processing power, these laptops are a perfect fit.  I couldn't be happier with mine and I hope all of you reading this review are equally as happy when you 1-click-order yours! :)","Date":"August 4, 2010"}
{"Title":"Great Ultralight Portable Laptop","Author":"Cornelius Suttree \"Corny\"","ReviewID":"RWIQ2BE9DBENS","Overall":"good","Content":"Asus is HUGE in Asia, but was not well known to me as a laptop maker until a year or so ago when friend bought an Asus in Bangkok and she loves hers. Now I see it at Best Buy all the time, but do not remember seeing Asus in years past. So I know now that Asus makes great products and the UL80VT is no exception. It is not perfect, but it is great at what it is suppsoed to be: An Ultralight computer with an amazing battery life, an excellent design and great performance for an Ultralight. Therefore I rate it 5 star. You cannot get Uber-Performance in an Ultralight, but I am strictly a non-gamer so this computer does everything I possibly need as fast as I need.PROS:1. Chiclet keyboard is fine with nice key spacing and, unlike others, I have not had any problems with the mousepad while typing.2. Case fit and finish is fine. I have not noted any problems with keyboard flex/screen fit etc.3. Minimum of bloatware. Every computer has this, but Asus is better than most.4. Two year Global warranty is better than anyone else, and 1-year Accidental Damage Warranty is also extended to TWO YEARS if you Register your computer within 60 days of purchase. (Every other manufacturer would charge you at least $100 extra for that kind of warranty.) BTW, ADW is a separate online registration which then generates an email with case number for a second mail-in for the ADW.5. Windows 7 is great - it automatically downloads software for any external device like a speech mike. I have 2 mikes, one Philips speech mike I use for work and one headset for Skype, and Windows 7 downloaded the software within seconds of plugging them in. Then when I plug in they become the default speaker, and when I unplug them the internal speakers take over seamlessly. (That was NOT the case with Vista on my home desktop where it was a huge hassle to go into Control Panel repeatedly.)6. I have not had a chance to put the battery life to the ultimate test, but after reading countless reviews and testimonials I trust it will truly last for 8-10+ hours (if not the 11.5-12 advertised) which is long enough for an international flight and as long as I would possibly need.7. Wi-Fi connection is great. Immediately recognized my home network and took me a minute or two to be online with this baby.8. Making recovery disks took about 3-4 hours, but it went fine with no glitches.9. It looks great and feels great!! It is a fingerprint magnet as commented on by scores of others, but the sleek looks are still impressive for a computer with a 12-cell battery. The black version looks marvelous - an eye catcher.10. An $800 laptop with a switchable dedicated/integrated Nvidia/Intel graphics option is a great deal.CONS:1. My biggest negative about this computer is the Mousepad/Mouse button. The mouse button is a single bar and you click on the far right or far left to right click or left click. Ths mouse button is VERY STIFF and awkward to use, especailly for Click and drag functions like to highlight text or drag something across the desk top. To click and drag I have to use two hands, one to hold the mouse button down and one to drag. If I could change ONE thing about the computer, it would be to split the mouse button (bar, in this case) in two and make it much less stiff. I avoid using the mouse button by single- or double-tapping on the mousepad, which is VERY responsive, but you still have to use the mouse button to click and drag and that has not loosened up much, if at all, over a month's use.2. The mousepad is dimpled, but still a shiny and slippery surface. Although it allows vertical and horizontal scrolling and multiple gestures on the pad, it gets greasy feeling and then the pad does not work well at times.","Date":"February 7, 2010"}
{"Title":"More Touchpad Issues","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R10CHJED098U1R","Overall":"bad","Content":"After a couple months of looking around, I finally settled on the UL80VT.  Was aware of some of the faults people were having (build quality, resolution, touch pad), but it seemed sporadic.  I received my UL80 yesterday.Goods:  The build seems fine, I do not have any of the creaking noises others have reported, the battery is nice and tight with no free play, the screen is tremendous (at least compared to my old laptop), but there is some flicker when switching between the graphics modes. Not a problem, and expected.Bad:  The touch pad is truly terrible. Following the initial start-up and installation routine, it literally took me over 30 minutes to get as far as the control panel using the touch pad to get the driver uninstalled, so the generic driver over the internet would load, as others have recommended.  Every time I touched the touch pad it would go into select mode.  It kept initiating programs, dragging screens, or the mouse pointer would randomly jump a short space.  Even turning off the \"tap\" option in the Elan drivers did not help when I finally made it that far. Several times I could not get the pointer to move at all, with any finger (clean hands).  After finally getting the generic PS2 mouse driver installed, similar problems remained.  I finally went to the Asus website and re-installed the Elan driver, and this time I was able to get the \"tap\" option deselected.  I also turned off the palm rest sensitivity which also helped.  The touch pad still is very dicey to use and I have tried several settings of sensitivity, but at least it doesn't select something every time I use it. It still completely ignores a request sometimes.Everything else so far on the unit is solid, but I travel a lot and cannot live without a trustworthy touch pad. I've ordered an additional mouse, but will often need just the touch pad.  Will try another day or so to get this working, but not happy at all currently.Jan 30 2010 Update:  No luck, have tried all the recommendations on the ASUS Support site.  Lots of others have complained about this.  Found other ASUS models at Staples with very nice touch pads, so it must be unique to this model; this UL80VT is going back.","Date":"January 28, 2010"}
{"Title":"Asus Tech Support is MIA","Author":"Green Mountaineer","ReviewID":"R9XJA4NEZNJ6Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had an ASUS UL80Vt for a week and after a week packed it up for return. My main problem wasn't that the battery was DOA and wouldn't charge (though the indicator insisted there was a 39% at all times, even after overnight charging and the warning light signalling \"dead battery). OK, I figured, stuff happens, even with a solid company's products. But what has totally soured me on Asus is the institutionalized 48 hours that that the company tells you it will take to respond to e-mailed technical problems. (And e-mail was the only way I saw to contact the company.)It took every minute of that 48 hours to get a reply to my first e-mail describing the problem. (Supposedly \"due to system error.\") And now, after 72 hours, I'm still waiting for a reply to my second e-mail, which was required because none of the BIOS fixes suggested in the first response worked. Nor did any of the others I managed to pry out and decipher on my own from the Asus website.I know that people swear by this company's hardware. And my battery problem truly did seem like a fluke, at least based on fruitless Google searches for others with similar problems. But, \"system error\" or not, Asus' Web and direct customer support stink. Maybe we're spoiled, but these days the customer service bar is set very high (kudos to Amazon for helping on this). And from my experience, Asus doesn't cut it in this important respect.I'd suggest that before buying an Asus product, poke around the support section of the website as if you were already an owner and experiencing some problems. Maybe you'll find sources for help that are better than what I found.By the way, Amazon was great on taking this product back.Finally, in case someone else experiences a similar problem with a battery on this model, here's the answer you'll wait at least two days to get from Asus. May these suggested fixes work better for you than they did for me.Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting ASUS Customer Service.Sincerely sorry for the delay due to system error.Would you please remove the battery and access bios by pressing F2 while the asus logo appears and load manufacture default, then press F10 save and exit.After that try to charge the battery again.Some customers report that after upgrade to windows 7,windows detect the battery incorrectly ,there is some compatibility problem with the windows 7.If still,would you please try update the latest BIOS, I suggest you use the winflash utility to update the BIOS in the windows mode. Please firstly download the winflash utility and the latest BIOS, install the winflash utility, run it and then set the path to the BIOS, then flash.

{"Title":"Simple awesome laptop....","Author":"Robyn Swaim \"robynthetexasvamp\"","ReviewID":"R10DMA5LVLATDV","Overall":"good","Content":"I own 3 computers - a desktop and 2 laptops.  My second laptop is this Asus.  It is the first Asus I've owned.  I thought about a netbook because I was looking for something portable for a lengthy trip I was planning (9 flights in six weeks for a total of almost 25,000 miles).  I wanted something to take with me so I could keep up with email, etc while I was away.  I nixed the netbook because for the money it didn't have the features I wanted - no dvd player/burner, poor battery life, small keyboard and screen (meaning too small for me - it might be great for someone else).  This is the laptop that gives you all the features of a netbook and still offers things you'd like to have in a laptop.  It's lightweight and small, but offers a great screen size for viewing.  I've seen some people complain about the screen, but I have no complaints.  I trudged around and thru many airports - and security checkpoints.  Trekking along with me my trusty Asus.  Always there for me when I needed it.  I don't know why people have complained about the build quality on these - I haven't noticed anything that even hints at poor quality with this model.  I figured after 7 times being put thru the machines at checkpoints in everywhere from Tokyo to Manchester, UK (and points in between) it might not survive, but it is still going strong.  I cannot recommend this laptop model too highly and I am very happy with it.","Date":"May 20, 2010"}

I adjusted the settings and got rid of most of it. (it was really jittery) It still comes and goes some times, but it's been pretty good mostly. The multitouch scroll is still a little jittery but it's usable. Also, the screen could use a better view angle.I haven't had time to try any games but it's supposed to have a decent graphics card for this size computer. I liked that it still had a DVD drive in it too. Some of the Dells and HPs don't at this size and performance. It's nice and light too and has a VERY long battery life as it can switch off the powerful graphics card and go to a built in one to save power.I wish it had bluetooth but that's not a big thing. That's really about the only thing I'd almost expect it to have that it doesn't.Oh and it's got a good warranty built in. Dell would charge an arm and a leg for this type of warranty (accidental damage and such for something like 2 years I think)All in all, if you are looking for best bang for the buck over the big name brands, this probably qualifies.","Date":"December 6, 2009"}

{"Title":"Awesome battery life, good for doing most tasks","Author":"Samir","ReviewID":"R1NYIZIY1O2QAS","Overall":"good","Content":"I consider myself a power user and I am very happy with this product.  The battery life is amazing, probably the best I have ever seen in a laptop and it is relatively fast.Pros:-EXCELLENT battery life.  I usually get around 9 hours battery life unless I am playing games but then I still get around 3-4 hours.  Just started school and it feels good to never have to charge the battery throughout the entire day whereas the people who have macs and supposedly paid a premium for battery life, have to charge it after a lecture or two.  There are very few if any laptops which give battery life as good as this and if they do they cost $2000 or more or are crappy netbooks that have no decent processing power.-You would think that a laptop with good battery life would have a crappy cpu but this has a pretty powerful dual core low power processor which allows me to do many things at once and performs very well.-Very flexible when unplugged.  You can choose between high battery life profiles (where cpu/gpu usage is minimized), high performance power profiles (which use the faster GPU and faster CPU settings) or a series of profiles in between.-Portable.  Very small laptop and that combined with good battery life means I don't need to drag my AC adapter to school since it lasts me the whole day.-Very slick looking and good build quality.  The brushed metal is very smooth and looks nice.  Also the keyboard is well designed, the screen bezel is shiny, and overall the laptop looks very slick and well built.-Instant on OS is very convenient.  If you just need to check e-mail, go on skype, IM or browse a site quickly then this will have you up and running in 20-30 seconds.  Very convenient.-Boot time on Windows 7 is very quick.-Decent discrete GPU.  I personally prefer ATI Radeon graphics cards but this does the job.  You can also switch between integrated/descrete GPUS to save battery life or increase performance as needed.-HDMI out.  Great for watching dvds, HULU, netflix or whatever on the TV.-Built in OS recovery.  So if everything goes to hell and you need to restore the computer software to its original state, push a button on startup and after a few minutes your laptop is in the same state it was (software wise) when you bought it.-GREAT VALUE.  As I mentioned before, getting all these features especially battery life and compact size in a laptop this cheap is very rare.Cons:-Driver support for the GPU is lacking because Nvidia is no supporting megatron or whatever its called for power switching on gpus.  There is a workaround to make newer drivers work for this laptop but its a pain.-Onboard microphone is crap but most onboard microphones are crap anyways so whatever.","Date":"October 15, 2010"}

Have a 5 yr old Dell Dimension laptop and it was time for a new one. I use a laptop for photo editing, word processing, web surfing, and travel with it.  This choice came down to this ASUS and the HP Dvt4.  The HP has better processor power, but I wanted real battery life.  The battery life with the ASUS has been great - at least 6-8hrs even on highest video settings, double most other current laptops. Photos look great on this screen and has plenty of processor power and memory for Photoshop editing and it's light weight!  It has just done everything I want it to.  Minor gripes: The split hard drive partition is a pain; Wish it had a CF memory card reader; and the plastic casing feels a tiny bit cheap - but is plenty firm.  Very good bang for the buck laptop.

However, first time I received it, the battery was bad. Calls to Asus just reaffirmed that it was a battery issue- they offered to sell me a new battery, couldn't do much else for me since I purchased it on Amazon. So, I returned it and got a new replacement... with the same issue!! When I went to return this one, I was just going to ask for a refund-- but turns out that was my only option cus it said they were now 'out of stock'... which I think may mean they pulled them because there was an issue with all batteries in their current shipment. If that's the case, I never received any info from Amazon about it. So, I had to find a new laptop at a new location. Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns policy so I was able to keep the laptop that the battery didn't work on until the new laptop came a week later.Besides the battery issue I had, it was a very nice laptop. Very sleek, I loved the look and feel of it. I ended up with a comparable Acer, that isn't nearly as attractive but was 200some dollars cheaper.","Date":"April 24, 2010"}

{"Title":"Best Laptop for the money","Author":"B. B.","ReviewID":"ROXHP5CRW4WXE","Overall":"good","Content":"This is most certainly the best laptop I could find for the price.  My last laptop was an alienware, so this is as thin as a sheet of paper compared to that one.I use this laptop for typing at work, watching and burning movies on DVDs and online, I stream my television from my house using a HAVA streamer, and I game on it.  I have not had any problems with anything on it yet.To show how well it works, I have downloaded Steam (a gaming app) and have played Team Fortress 2, Boarderlans, Left 4 Dead, and Modern Warefare 1 and 2 without any problems.  MW2 is obviously not set to the highest settings, but still runs well at rather high settings.Graphically this laptop is not goinging to replace a desktop if your editing videos or using a CAD system, but for most people, this should be all you need.The battery life is better than any other laptop I have seen.  With the size, you would think that you could squeeze out three hours of life out of this one, but with moderate internet usage, including streaming a movie or two, and burning a DVD, I can get about 6 hours.  Turning off most settings and just watching a DVD or typing reports on battery saver, I have had it on just battery for over 11 hours.The screen is excellent as well.  I heard complaints about viewing angle, and it is true that if you have many people looking at the monitor, it looses it's crisp picture a foot or two to either side, but I did not buy this for that purpose.  two to four people watching the screen far enough back have had no problems.Cons:The absolute WORST thing I can find about this laptop is that the front edge is oddly sharp.  It can get a little uncomfortable if you lean your palms on it for the mouse buttons for a prolonged time, but I use an external mouse, so I do not have that problem.I would say that if you are considering this computer, then get it.  Windows 7 only makes it better, it may take a day to get use to it if you are moving from XP, but watch the tip videos online and learn the new features and you'll appreciate the upgrade.","Date":"February 25, 2010"}

Before I bought it I called the retailer Adorama & asked if it was faulty if they would exchange, I was told yes. When I recived it it seamed great, but I had it plugged in. I loaded everything I wanted onto it, it even ran CS4 without an issue with plug-ins (though CS4 said it would have problems due to the processor).  Two days after I tried out the switching between video (onboard & dedicated) & had some issues with in not being smooth transition, but was able to sort that out. Then later I unplugged it for the first time & found out either; battery was DOA, power supply system was DOA, or the motherboard was DOA. I spend hours on the phone with ASUS trying to clear the problem up to no avail. Because I had purchessed it for a 3-4 (depart in less than 3 weeks) month trip I needed it to be dealt with quickly. So I tried to exchange it with Adorama as I had been promised I could, they absolutly refused. In the past I have always had exillent on time delivery service with Adorama, that is why I have spent $20K+ with them with my photography buisness. Granted I had never needed to return any of the equipment I had bought untill now, but I can honestly say they have lost all of my future buisness forever!  So now I have had to send it into ASUS, with a 3-8 week turn around expected. So I have spent $880 for a new latop to use on a photography trip, that will not be back untill after I leave, & ASUS will not send it to anything other than my origonal address on the order. So now I have to go out & purchess another laptop for my trip.  As for ASUS purely I have bought 3 of thier computers; 1 desktop, 1 laptop, & 1 netbook. Not a single one of them has worked right off the bat. The desktop had a video card & ram that were not installed properly, the laptop discussed above worked as long as pluged in, & the netbook had a corrupted harddrive. All were brand new, the 2 that exchanged & fixed worked great since then. Seriously though that have the wost QA I have ever scene to have 3 out of the products purchessed at diffrent times, stores, & locations to have problems. Though if you are willing to not be able to use you're puchess for 3-8 weeks then they are pretty good, can't beat the warrenty without paying allot extra.

It's a bit heavier and the battery life is under 3 hours but it's almost as thin and comfortable as the ASUS, and it WORKS.  It turned out to be a blessing that I had to return the ASUS because this VAIO is exactly what I needed.","Date":"July 2, 2010"}

I am not against HP's cause I've experienced others that do not suffer from the same 'defects' as this.1)Don't put this laptop on your lap, you will get 2nd or 3rd degree burns2)Do not expect exceptional battery life (although the same can be said about half the pc's on the market today) but expect to be connected to the power cable for the most part3)It may run slowly at times but to be fair be sure the cause of that is not user basedAll in all it is not a bad machine but HP definitely needed to iron out these issues before releasing this product","Date":"October 31, 2010"}
{"Title":"Hot....","Author":"gliffy","ReviewID":"R3UW4IR4S3WQ0T","Overall":"bad","Content":"For the price, I thought this would be a decent buy. The specs looked amazing on paper with a good processor, enough ram and memory. The big screen is nice too. It was nice having the HDMI and also SD/XD/etc card slot. Make sure you get the windows 7 upgrade too, it was well worth it.Cons:  As already mentioned,the battery is poor. I couldn't make it through a 2 hour class without it being plugged in. The battery was shot after a year. The computer itself heated up really fast... faster than any other laptop I have used; a friend told me that HP used cheap hardware for a couple of years, and that is why this model gets really hot. I also noticed early on, that the power supply connection was never secure, it seemed to wiggle easily. I also noticed that the CD drive was really loud, but that is understandable being it is a laptop.My biggest complaint with this computer is its poor recording capability. This computer wasn't able to record anything of notable quality, from webcam videos to audio from lectures I attended (using one note). It always turned out bad, after multiple calls to customer support, re-installing drivers and updating them again, the problem was never solved.  There are also multiple forums about users experiencing the same problems... just look up HP G60 recording issues.","Date":"December 10, 2011"}

This laptop had 3 hardware failures prior to the warranty running out including two complete mother board replacements.  After the warranty ran out the battery died and the laptop needs to be plugged into the wall now.  The most recent problem is that it will not boot and will not allow me to perform a system recovery.  The worst part is the lack of support from Gateway.  Absolutely will not stand behind their product.  For a $200 fee they will provide PHONE support through a center in India.  F  these guys.  I hope they go out of business.

{"Title":"Reliably Unreliable","Author":"Navi","ReviewID":"RFFJGKZCCYOIP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this laptop almost 2 years ago now and I've gotta say, it's been a lot of hassle. To begin, the one I have now is actually the second one, because about a month after my original purchase, the video hardware failed, and I had to return it for a different one. By about a year later, the battery was died, the screen frame was cracked in multiple places, and 2 of the keys were broken. (As a note: The keys on this laptop are nearly impossible to take off without breaking them, making it difficult to clean underneath.) So this causes me to send it off to Gateway (just before the 1 year warranty ended).Besides those problems, I found the touchpad to be overly sensitive for where it is placed (under where your left palm goes, causing the tap-to-click to go off, making typing an annoyance.) The keys on the keyboard are also completely flat, making it hard to touch type. I also found that it runs incredibly hot, and is the only computer I've ever had overheat, and multiple times in 1 day even. (I've had it run at 80C with just Google Chrome open with Pandora, and nothing else running.)","Date":"July 18, 2011"}

In March of 2010, just three months after purchase the computer motherboard went out, then when I was returned the computer fresh from the Geek Squad repair shop, the Microsoft Windows 7 version was not genuine?  The day the manufacturers warranty would have expired, the hard drive crashed and It is still at the Geek Squad reapir shop now waiting for the 19.95 operating system disk I had to order because Gateway is too cheap to include when you pay way too much for their inferior jumble of junk parts.  I spent 700.00 at Best Buy for this computer, purchased the additional 3 years of product protection for 269.00 and I am back using my piece of junk Dell desktop, I lovingly call the dependable dinosaur.

Unfortunately the hard drive caddy needed to install the hard drive is not included. That's not surprising, but you can't order the caddy from Gateway, any of Gateway's parts distributors, ebay, or anywhere else online!So you would contact Gateway support for this, right?When you contact the worthless Gateway support they will first tell you, sure you can order a hard drive. When you point out you don't want to order a hard drive, you just want the caddy to install the hard drive, they will tell you that you can get that at a local store. When you point out that you can't order this anywhere, they will tell you to check a local store. When you point out that this is a proprietary part and ask \"if my gateway logo fell off the laptop cover would you also tell me to check a local store?\" their answer will be to check a local store. When telling them to go to hell, they will tell you to check a local store. No, I'm not kidding.To make matters worse the wired and wireless devices stopped working after 6 months (do not even show up in device manager anymore) along with the VGA port and one of the USB ports.","Date":"June 16, 2010"}

I left it for more than 30 minutes and I was shocked to see a non-stop static screen when I came back.I waited for a few minutes for it to stop but it won't so I press the power button until it shut down.It won't boot up after an attempt but the lid on the front that indicates sleep mode is still there and my Mac is heating up so bad.This is the first time that my Mac has heaten up this bad!Boot it up after a few minutes and dismayed that it won't boot up again.The apple icon was loading during startup but it will eventually lead to a black screen with yellow line on the right side.It is frustrating! It is only just 5 months old and I love my Mac so much that I am very much careful not to overcharged it or anything.I have it checked on a PowerMac center and was told that they will have the parts replaced for free whatever the defective part is and was instructed to follow up after a week. 2.5 weeks later I was informed that they have requested the parts to Apple already for replacement as part of the 1 year limited warranty of Apple. Now, after 3 weeks, I am still waiting of when my Macbook Pro will be back. I am very disappointed that this has happen in only 5 months time.Barely a month after I sent it to the PowerMac service center, my Macbook has been fixed and was told that the whole logic board has been replaced. When asked what was the possible reason for the circuit deficiency, they did not gave an exact answer since the technician did not tell what has been the problem. I ask the Solutions team and the closest answer I got was due to the firmware update that was not installed properly.","Date":"December 1, 2011"}

Before you say anything I did try to get help on line and in person at an apple store to resolve the issues but Hmmm. no one could explain it.  Go figure.  I will keep it until it dies, which alas, may be a while,  but I will never buy another.  Give me a PC any day.  Besides with the strides others are making there's not much that warrants an apple purchase anymore anyway.","Date":"August 21, 2012"}

{"Title":"I \"went mac\" and I am heading back!","Author":"John Skupien","ReviewID":"R2JBAV715CMWS","Overall":"bad","Content":"After nearly a month on a Macbook Pro 13\" I have officially decided I am not a mac person.  The low review is mostly for the shortcomings of using a Mac in the business world.  Having just missed two appointments and learning that my calendar was not (and cannot!) syncing Outlook for Mac 2011.  Being very comfortable with  windows and reliant upon office I have been using a hybrid approach to office.  I installed windows using VM fuse on a virtual machine and it was slow and caused confusion over which copy of outlook I should be using.  Further more formatting problems between documents created using office for Mac and windows proved way to annoying.Bottom line is that I am sure the macbook pro is great for someone in the creative field.  It is not for those who are in business and rely on products such as office.Enough venting on why not mac.The computer,Keyboard- pro--comfortable to type on  con lousy selection of wireless extended keyboardsCamera/skye --very clear and adjusted to lighting differences nicely con- nonespeed --slow at times especially when using windows on virtual machineUSB 3.0 --oops forgot to put this in.  Accidentally put in some other Thunderbolt connection...good for external monitor...but what else?Fingerprint password option--not here and not good (secure) on any mac.Overall quality is nice, but, for the price think it is more Steve Jobs hype.","Date":"May 9, 2011"}

{"Title":"I don't know who these other users are, but this is not a good computer","Author":"J. Borgeson","ReviewID":"R48SZ0RWEO9J2","Overall":"bad","Content":"Maybe I received a previously loved model, but this computer sucks for several reasons.  I had it for two weeks and this is what I observed.While fast, I never really had a chance to put it through hoops with any gaming or true test of the processor.  ALso, it bricked itself about once a day from hardware (no blue-screen or Windows 7 equivalent), just the screen turned black and emitted a buzzing noise until I held down the power button for a few seconds.1) Screen resolution: 1366x768 is considered acceptable now?  My last computer was 5 years old and not even top of the line at that time, but I was shocked to see these Jitterbug-like icons and general ugliness on a 2010 device.  I don't know how these marketing jerks can think they can get away with calling this HD when it is nowhere close.2) Touchpad is terrible.  The scrolling bar on the right seems like it was intentionally designed to be frustrating.  In addition, the multitouch frequently reacts if I have my other palm anywhere resting on the keyboard (like if you use keyboard shortcuts like a normal user).  Finally, I agree with the other review that the bumps on the pad are distracting and lead to errors.3) Sound - not great to begin with and one time when I accidentally had two sounds start at once it decided that it would never again play anything at full volume.  I tried for an hour to find out why and looked through the troubleshooting for the sound card and the sound driver.  No dice.All in all, it is obviously a cheaply made part that would probably fail in more ways if I kept it any longer.  Two weeks is enough.  I want my $1000 back.","Date":"April 27, 2010"}

{"Title":"Lenovo technical issues.","Author":"Gosu Rosu","ReviewID":"RIMP3EVQF4ULF","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have only used the SL-410 for about two weeks, so my experience is, admittedly, limited with this product.Overall I would rate this a 4-star laptop, excellent for moderate business productivity.  The screen is sharp, glossy, but so much that it catches glare coming from florescent lights, or through office windows. The keyboard buttons are large and I find typing fairly simple and easy. The mouse interface has both the \"nub\" (my own word) which is a characteristic red finger sensor that used to be common on most of the major brands but only remains on Lenovo laptops, and the trackpad, which does hiccup sometimes, so your cursor can jump around unintentionally if you don't use small gestures. I have no problem with either of these really.Initially, when you boot up the computer you will encounter the telltale bloatware present on every new PC these days. My first boot up took nearly twenty minutes (18m:45s) and until I disabled all of the completely unnecessary programs running the performance was quite pathetically slow for a Core 2 Duo processor. However, I used the MSCONFIG utility (type MSCONFIG in the search bar of the start menu) to disable all of the bloatware on startup and when I rebooted the computer was a far more reasonable 3 minutes.It was when I went to backup the system disks on the Lenovo partition that I ran into my first problem. I ordered the Dual Layer DVD rom specifically for a project that requires a lot of data backup, so when the system hanged after I put in the DVD-DL, I was distressed to discover that my laptop was configured with the CD-RW combo drive, despite the invoice and order information containing the part # of a  DL drive. Lenovo's post-sales number (1.866.428.4465) gave me someone with imperfect English who told me to call technical support. I called the number from the invoice--and to make a long story short, I have been bounced back to post-sales and I am waiting to find out if I need to ship the whole computer back or if they can just send my a new drive. Since I don't think that Lenovo's DVD drives are modular the way that Dell and HP drives are, I think I must ship it all back. As it turns out, this is a good thing, as I have since discovered that my RAM isn't the 1066mhz DDR2 that I ordered, but 800mhz DDR2, which isn't really that much of a performance decrease, but still, I should have received what I paid for.Anyway, I reduced my rating by 2 stars to account for each of these misconfigured items, and if my Lenovo return process goes well I will post a comment amending my review rating.","Date":"April 7, 2010"}

As a result, one of the speakers is not working and the battery is only charging to half of its capacity after about one year.  Unfortunately, it is out of warranty.

{"Title":"Cheap Components leads to nightmare problems","Author":"alphaethan","ReviewID":"R34LUMUYQ4QEKL","Overall":"bad","Content":"Pros:Intel processor, screen size, Thinkpad line, okay cooling, adequate graphicsCons:  First of all, my unit came with Windows 7 X64 pro on it, not exactly the same as this one-\"Ctrl\" key is NOT the left most one on the bottom row, for someone who uses keyboard shortcuts, it's a nightmare to always remind myself \"it's the second to the last key\".-worst motherboard ever, as you will have issues installing another windows 7 version or upgrading later on, because the storage drivers are not compatible and leads to BSOD or failure during system install.  At first I thought it was the CD/USB drive that I loaded Windows 7 x64 Ultimate onto, but installed Win 7 on two other PC's (laptop and desktop) without a hitch with the same disc/USB.  In all fairness Microsoft also to blame partly for this problem.  Common M$, keep the communications open with 3rd party distributors and ensure your valued customers does not have to spend days to figure out a simple 15 min system upgrade/install.-Cheap feel, mind you this is not a business class laptop albeit the \"Thinkpad\" line name, it does not have a metal skeleton inside the case such as the high-end Thinkpads or Alienware; you get what you paid for in this case.-Owned the unit ~1 year, used it infrequently since I have another HP from work, finally got Windows 7 installed by pulling out the hard drive and installed Win 7 onto it in my work laptop (yeah it installed fine), then placed the hard drive back into this unit.  Junked it at a local PC shop for $250 in return.  The unit runs Win 7 ok after all that nonsense, but still with errors.Other thoughts:Laptops are not like desktops, which you can easily swap out a motherboard if problems occur; such case is when my desktop's mobo died I just swapped out a new one with $50 and an hour of my time.  For a laptop, you either spend $300+ for labor/parts or you spend a day trying to replace it.  Hate to say it, since Lenovo took over the Thinkpad Line, those junky Asian parts just pollute this line of premium mobile computing.  My suggestion for Lenovo is to change the name of these laptops to \"Unthink Pads\", it certainly stifles encouragement of any further dealings with Lenovo on my end.

I am 82 and an ex Men's Clothing Store Mgr., Shoe Store Mgr. and Buyer with over 25 years in Sales.  I have since returned the Lap Top after 2 weeks use and found several problems with it.  I sent a letter to Mr. Jeff Bezos CEO of Amazon as well as Zedekiah Nyanchama explaining my dissatisfaction with it and asked for a full refund. My purchase price of $117.14 w/ shipping & handling plus my return UPS charges of $37.42 and was credited with only the $117.14.  I wrote to both Amazon and seller explaining the fact that the LT had operational problems, battery that couldn't hold a charge and was badly scratched with a loose cover that was not steady because of a rubber pad on the bottom. The seller replied back that a tech had checked it out and did not find any problems. Well i found them, and expected a full refund with the UPS return charges because the product was not properly or truly represented in the ad. The picture above does not represent the product shipped to me.  There was no disc as shown.  Only a badly worn Lap Top w/ power cord and box attachment.I also stated how disappointed with the Customer Care Service from the seller and did not understand why Amazon did not back the product as advertised. This was my first experience with Amazon Marketplace and because i was not afforded a full and complete refund for purchase and return charges as yet.  I will not purchase any more Merchandise from Amazon.  I thought my letter to Mr. Bezos would have prompted Amazon to ask the seller to reimburse me for the return of a faulty and operational problems that did not meet the Advertised Explanation.Sincerely Yours,Charles Redfoot","Date":"October 25, 2013"}

And further, there is no real documentation to indicate why.I would NOT recommend this laptop on principle as I believe this to be a bait-n-switch tactic, where Acer put features on the back of the box, and hoped customers wouldn't notice the difference.  :-/Pay a little more for a different machine, and get what you pay for.","Date":"January 31, 2010"}

My girlfriend's $800 Toshiba has a worse trackpad, but this one is still terrible.  As I write this review it will suddenly select a part of the paragraph up a couple lines and I'll find myself typing in the middle of where I already was typing.  Argh!!That's not the worst part.  Every time I wake this computer from sleep, it is 100X slower than before.  It is so bad that if I ever accidentally put it to sleep (like, close the lid), I just hold down the power key and restart it.  It's unusably slow after sleep... like the processor never fully cycles-up after sleep mode.  But if it never goes to sleep (I've changed the settings so when it is plugged in it never goes to sleep) it is fine.  I'm trying to contact Acer \"Technical Support\", which so far has been an oxy-moron.  Typical of PCs but I believe Acer is one of the worst in this department.This is on a brand-new computer.  No porn, no spyware, no programs installed by me except iTunes.Cough up the dough and get a Mac.

Probably less than 5 hours on this machine. Pretty much defective immediately. Now that it's been more than 14 days since we purchased it (Best Buy), we have to work through the warranty service, which means we'll probably have to send it off and wait a month. UGH!!

I thought attaching the mouse would be \"the answer\" even though that sort of defeats the purpose of having a laptop.  The mouse attaches at the side, so the mouse cord is always in the way.  Irritating. And when you type, getting close to the pad makes the cursor jump out of where you are typing, so you have to go find it and kidnap it back to your app.Window's 7 isn't near as wonderful as advertised.

They are making computers thinner and lighter which ends up restricting the airflow. This causes internal parts to overheat. The typical result in my computer is that the graphics card will overheat and cause the system to lock up.I have this Dell Studio 15\" with factory upgraded ram and other goodies totaling about $1000 investment. Since the new box arrived at my door a year ago, it has continually crashed and locked-up. Dell support has tried everything under the sun, short of giving me a new computer. This includes sending techs to my house and replacing internal parts like the graphics card, motherboard, etc. Alas, nothing changes. The fan always runs at full throttle within moments of start-up. If I try to watch a video or even if a web-page has anything using flash, immediately graphics card failure occurs resulting an over-sized cursor and a total system lock-up. My only option is to do a hard system shutdown. Disabling flash or other scripts only delays the inevitable.I have owned several Dells in the past and WAS a huge fan of Dell; however, this experience has left me very frustrated and disappointed. One tech advised me to purchase a Toshiba as they are not having this issue because their laptops are still a little bulkier providing better airflow.","Date":"June 6, 2011"}

Less than two months old and Dell has had to send out the on-site repair man twice.  The system freezes unexpectedly several times a day and the display goes bonkers periodically without warning, sometimes even going completely blank.  The system can even suddenly stop and shut down (and I do not mean it goes through the shut down procedure; I mean it just stops as if the power disappeared).Dell customer support is a total joke.  First there is the customer run around issues.  Then they sent the repair man the wrong parts and he called Dell directly from our house and had to argue with them as they couldn't figure out which part they were meant to send.  The repair man knew the part but the Dell operator did not know what they were doing.The case is absolute rubbish as well.  The plastic is the thinnest plastic I've seen yet on a laptop and it appears to not be very durable.In addition the keyboard is not good either as already the 'M' key is not registering correctly when you press it.  Sometimes it works and sometime it doesn't.The cooling fan is permanently stuck on full now as if the system can not cool down or something.Dell, replaced the motherboard and the speakers in my wife's Studio 15 already and the system lasted all of one day and is back to it's old tricks.  We've concluded the only way to fix this computer is to get a full refund; which we are in the process of doing now.STAY very FAR AWAY from DELL now.  They used to be good but they are worse than garbage now.  If you buy a DELL you might as well light your money on fire.

This happens to my Dell Studio at least once a day, up to around 10 times a day.  Usually the freeze only lasts for about 30 seconds, but sometimes it will cause an application or the whole system to crash, dumping any data you may have wanted to save.If you go to Dell Support for help, prepare for the runaround.  Dell's whole support system seems like it was designed to be unhelpful--which makes sense given their various schemes to \"encourage\" users to pay for support.  If you try to figure out the problem on your own, you may conclude as I did that the cause lies in the BIOS (yes, the one installed by Dell).  Fortunately, most manufacturers have updated BIOS files available for download from their official sites.  Unfortunately, on the Dell site, the link is connected to the wrong file, so you have to find the right one yourself.  And then, when you finally download the right file, you will find that the enclosed program has multiple bugs & won't update your BIOS after all.  As far as I can tell, there is NO WAY to update BIOS for my Dell without paying, which to me seems outrageous.I got this Dell because I read some great reviews online.

Just four months after I bought it, it began running very loudly and overheating. I contacted Dell support, and they sent a technician to replace the heat sink, fan assembly, motherboard, and battery. They essentially told me that they didn't know what the problem was, so they were just going to replace everything and hope for the best. It did work for a while after this, although occasionally it would still make the whirring noises, especially with a cd in the drive.The computer is made of very cheap, flimsy plastic, and all of the plastic around the power button that is (very stupidly)located on a external hinge had already broken off. I was literally holding it together with tape, and a friend I know with this computer had the same problem. Then one day, just about a month after the one year warranty ran out, it would not turn on at all. I assumed that maybe the wires going to the power button had been damaged, since they were exposed. Instead, when I took it into my local computer repairman, I was told that my motherboard was totally shot, and apparently ordering parts from Dell is difficult and very expensive. Thus, just barely over a year after purchasing this computer, I recycled it for parts and said good riddance.Horrible.

We did not authorize service. We told them to send it back.It came back dirty, the hinges were cracked worse than before, and the OS needed  to be rebooted from a restore point. They had obviously worked on it without our authorization and then hastily put it back together when they found out they weren't going to fool us into paying them.I didn't know this when we bought the machine, but Dell has been involved in fraud allegations for years now. A simple Google search turns up several articles.We now believe that this bait & switch tactic was their plan all along, as they knew what the issues were (even other Amazon reviewers have encountered the same issues) and they told us to send it in anyway.It's patently obvious that it was always their plan to try and charge us $$$ once they got their hands on the machine.

So Sony had effectively told me that I would have to pay an additional $200 on top of the $800 I had already paid just months earlier to have my laptop returned to the same condition it was in before it failed due to their own poor quality.My advice: there are plenty of other laptops to choose from that treat their customers better and make better quality products that don't fail within months of purchase.

Just go buy a new one.I don't like worrying about my warranties, so although the computer comes with a well-written standard warranty, i purchasedthe$250.00  Protection Plus Warranty Upgrade (Years 1-3) plus i purchased the $180.00  Toughbook Premier 3 Year Service Upgrade  and i also purchased the $175.00  3-Year On-site ServiceMy computer broke (i dropped it--not from Six feet, but from about the height of my bedside table...)Panasonic made me prove the warranty by sending a copy of my sales reciept before they would even talk to me about service.Then they tried to talk me out of having the on site service, saying it would be faster and easier if i just sent them the computer.The onsite service guy was nice, but had not been trained on how to fix the Toughbooks, so he took it home with him and sent it to Panasonic.That was a week ago.The onsite guy said i should leave my hard drive inside the computer.He called later and said Panasonic would send me a new computer right away.Then he called back and said that they would not cover accidental damage...and i should have bought one more warranty...I pointed out that the warranty covered \"non-intential damage\"...their representative said that while \"non intentional\" seems to mean \"accidental\" it does not mean that \"accidental\" is covered!The manager at Panasonic promised to look into my case...but never called me back.One of my warranties included 'overnight' service.I was later told that \"overnight' means next business night, which, on a Friday, means Monday...but because Monday comes after Sunday, Monday means Tuesday...Anyway, they have my money, and my computer....and this review.","Date":"November 11, 2010"}

{"Title":"Bad experince with Toughbook","Author":"Cecil Cotton","ReviewID":"R1CUR8IH5SLJ19","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Toughbook arrived late, the explanation I got was the delay was due to hurricane Sandy which was on the east coast. The Toughbook was shipped from California which I thought was on the west coast the last time I checked. According to the tracking number it was in FedEx depot for 6 days in Sacremento Ca.I was told it would be shipped in 5-7 bussiness days at the time I purchased it on line. They lost 6 days before it left California.  Now that I have finally received it, I was offered $20.00 off for the trouble but I do not see where they have reduced the price. On a positive note they did add a touch screen that I did not purchase I don't know if that was the cause for the delay, I do like the touch screen it is very handy, so thanks for that.  My biggest complaint is the battery will not charge. I thought although it was a refurbished computer it would at least have a new (chargable) battery. I let it charge for a full day but I could only get about 2 minutes of life once I disconnected it from the power source. This does not work for me in my field, I do not always have access to power.  I think Amazon should review who they deal with, this is a reflection on you. I will always be cautious in the future when dealing with you.","Date":"December 8, 2012"}

Right out of the box I noticed the the keyboard was very warm.  To prevent overheating I began elevating it to ensure good air flow and prevent excessive overtemp problems.I loaded StarcraftII and after playing for a very short time it just shut down, no warning - nothing.  After restarting and going back to Starcraft I noticed that the left side of the keyboard was extremely hot, too hot to touch and then it shut down again.  After several of these events, I began to get Windows file corruption errors most likely due to the improper shut downs.I called Toshiba and returned it for repair.  Unfortunately their tech ignored the overheating problem, re-imaged the drive and returned it as \"fixed\".  I had to call Toshiba again and complain about what they'd not done.  They respond by asking me to return it again.  We'll see what happens this time.The problem is mentioned on the Toshiba forums [...] though Toshiba has not admitted there could be a problem.The heat issue was also mentioned by [...]so it isn't just in our heads.I CANNOT recommend this notebook until Toshiba comes up with a viable fix.  Especially if you need it for your livelyhood, there is too much downtime if you get a bad one.  Also it's pricing needs to be reigned in.  Even if it worked properly it is currently too expensive for the features included.","Date":"September 15, 2010"}

Its also nearly $800 more than its currently listed for on other sites, like new egg ($1,725.00) or even Toshiba itself ($1,899.00.)

She absolutely loved it until a misterious \"internal crack\" appeared on the screen last week which made it unusable.I opened a repair request with Samsung and sent the unit to the repair location specified by Samsung. I thorughly inspected the unit to see if it had any signs of damage to the case or the screen. Everything looked perfect. No damage of any kind.After 2 days, I received a call from the repair shop telling me about the internal crack. They stated that this happens \"very frequently\" with Samsung Laptops and Notebooks. Even the slightest pressure on the outside cover can damage the screen. All the exercise this laptop gets is when we open and close its lid in order to use it. We don't take it on trips or even move it from its location at my wife's desk. She even kept the plastic protector that came on the outside of the laptop lid so as to avoid any scratches, etc. She could not be more gentle with this unit yet it appears that it will break with the slightest touch.  This is inexcusable for a mobile computing device.Samsung has rejected any responsibility for the poor quality of their product design so now I will have to spend over $300 to repair a $700 3-month old Laptop. This is very dissapointing and, given Samsung's indiference, it will be the last Samsung product I buy.UPDATE - A letter to the office of the president yielded no positive results.

Contacted Samsung and so began the real fun. I was told it would have to mailed in to a repair center and all I would need to do was drop it off at and UPS store. I decided to call Samsung and verify how long the process would take. I was told it would take a MONTH!. 5-7 Business days for shipping both ways and 10-14 to repair it. After 2 weeks of not hearing anything from Samsung, I decided to give them a call. I was told it needed to have the mother board replaced (after a total of 20 hours of use) and they are waiting on parts. I then inquired as to how long it would be before I got my laptop back, I was then told it would take 7-14 days from when they received the part to the time it was repaired then another 5-7 for shipping back. Is it just me or is it too much to ask to just mail me a new one! I'm sorry your shoddy quality might bite into your profit margin, but don't sell something you can't support!And I'm sure that my case is a 1 in 1000 occurrence. Many people probably own this laptop w/o any problems. 6-8 weeks (what its looking now) is ridiculous.

I think the heat is also responsible for the USB drive on the left not working anymore. We got it on a Christmas Walmart blowout special for $225. It's okay, I guess, for what you pay for it and for minimal use, but Toshiba had issues with those satellite computers running hot.

{"Title":"The last Dell I will ever buy.","Author":"Shawn \"djsaint\"","ReviewID":"R3VGDYX083A6M4","Overall":"bad","Content":"My wife and I have been loyal Dell customers over 10 years and four machines. All our previous machines have performed well and we have never had much reason to call customer service for anything. The few times we did (years and years ago) were reasonably pleasant experiences, though. My impression of Dell has always been that they are a solid company that produces solid products.Not now.This laptop, which is my wife's, has been nothing but a nightmare from day one. Pathetic battery life, hardware and software issues, trackpad problems, cursor jumping around, intermittent wireless problems, a shoddily-made machine with flimsy screen hinges that easily break.Dell's customer service has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any company in my entire life. I started out trying to return the unit, but quickly found out that they count the number of days that you have had the computer as starting on the day you order the unit, not the day you receive it, so I was two days past the last day I could return the unit. After being transferred back and forth between two different departments who each thought the other department was supposed to help me, I finally found someone who understood the issue and said he would work on getting special approval to return the unit and then call me back. He also sent me an email. He never called back, never responded to emails, never answered the phone, never returned calls. Anyone else I talked to acted like they knew nothing and told me I could not return the unit. Then I tried to appeal to their business sense, by trying to exchange the unit for a higher model (figuring that if they saw I wanted to pay them more money, they would forgive the 2-day thing).It took me two more weeks of calling every day to find a guy in their corporate customer service group who (even though he shouldn't have even helped me) agreed that what I wanted to do made good business sense and would help the company hold onto a loyal customer. It took him two more weeks to get what he told me was internal approval for the return (their system only allowed them to process it as a return, not a repair or replacement). He even CC'd me on the email where the manager approved the return and gave him instructions on how to process it. I was told I would receive a return code and instructions on how to return the unit for credit. A week went by--nothing. I called and emailed the guy over and over. No response. I finally got someone else who's email address was on the approval email to respond, who explained that the person who approved the return was in one of two different departments who had to approve the return. He said what everyone else always told me--that he would personally take responsibility for resolving my case. He gave me a phone number that was supposedly his direct number and an email. Never heard from him again. The phone number went to a generic mailbox.After months of getting the runaround and taking every my lunch hour every day to sit on the phone while eating a sandwich, I simply gave up and decided it just wasn't worth it for a $560 laptop. We are already shopping for a replacement after 7 months of owning this thing. Guess who we won't be buying it from.","Date":"August 14, 2010"}

This laptop is a secondary laptop which is an decent laptop for office, and internet use but that's about it. I would not recommend this for gaming, graphics or even photo shop. This machine is not upgradable after 4gb of ram and the video card is garbage, and this network card does not support wireless N, also I'm an IT guy and Ive owned lots of laptops and net-books but this one was by far the worst of them all. This thing has so many bugs and problems I simply just gave it away to my wife after fixing it many of times. The good side of this laptop is it is really good looking but attracts lots of finger prints. Also if one of the buttons fall off your keyboard good lucking fixing it because the bottom of the button is made of cheap plastic it will break on impact. I've had this laptop have hard drive failure, buttons jamming, and also it locks up on some movies I try to watch or even play. Another problem with this laptop is some times the right click will just turn on by it self causing me to highlight everything or right click on stuff for no damn reason. I have an older laptop with Hewlett Packard AMD dual core that runs perfect and its two years older than this crap. Overall I will never buy a dell again and if you have a problem good luck getting help from dell tech support, they will basically keep transferring you to other departments until some one hangs up on you and you have to start all over again. If you looking for a laptop for overall quality I would suggest looking else where and finding a more up to date computer that is not a DELL and one that supports N wireless, have a separate video card like Nvidia or ATI.","Date":"September 12, 2010"}

{"Title":"never again","Author":"Abigail Stella","ReviewID":"R2C2LL1WEIE1DW","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am going out of my way to warn all future purchasers of my horrible experience with Dell and this computer. I purchased this labtop two years ago from Dell at a premium with the extended warranty on the hardware and software I thought. Within 24 hours of receiving this computer, it crashed. After 4 hours on hold and limited moments actually speaking (or trying to hold a conversation due to significant language barriers) with the technicial support staff, I was told that my software had crashed and that this was not covered in my warranty. My options were to send the computer back (at my own shipping costs) and with a -300$ restocking fee for the computer that I ad purchased 24 hours earlier or pay 200$ for a software warranty for someone to resotre my computer. After extreme frustration, I ended up paying the 200$ to have my computer fixed over the next few days (with me doing the work and spening my time to do it).Since then, it has never worked well. I frequently had to use startup launcher to help turn it on despite multiple spyware and antivirus products recommended to me to purchase by the dell technicians.Most recently my hard drive crashed for no reason.My experience with the technicians and managers was frustrating, time consuming and has only led me to believe and want to let the world know that I will never again purchase a product from Dell and recommend that others take my advice as well.- A very disappointed customer","Date":"January 29, 2013"}

A few days after purchasing my laptop my hard drive crashed for no reason and would not boot up.Then my right mouse button stopped working, i was disappointed. Then my webcam stopped working while I was in the middle of a video chat and it just died in the middle of it and wouldn't even detect it. Then my all my USB ports stopped working...WOW. Then a short while later my DC Jack(Power Plug In) stops working i am not able to charge my computer or even turn it on anymore, at first i didn't know what was wrong with my computer, so i call dell (somewhere in India) and they want to charge me per minute to find out and diagnose what's wrong with my computer of coarse i say no. Then i take it out to be repaired with my own money to a local repair man who charged me $150 to have it repaired. And then a short while later my battery dies(now i'm MAD). After that to add insult to injury my battery charger stopped working as well. As my closing statement this is the worst computer i have ever bought, DO NOT BUY IT, IDK about the seller though i bought it form dell.

{"Title":"WAS a really nice little laptop!","Author":"R. Wall","ReviewID":"R312IURLQUC6FM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had similar observations to what previous raters have had...smudges easily, partitioning the hard drive is not a smart setup, and battery life is okay, but quite a bit less than desired. The good stuff...I love the keyboard. It may feel a little cramped for those with bigger hands, but it feels solid; good quality. Thats important to me on a laptop since it's the part receiving the most interaction from the user. The mouse pad is great too. I love the soft, yet solid feel of the buttons. The size and weight are fantastic--super portable. The processor is quick in my opinion, although I don't play games or use graphics intense programs. The startup is a little slower than I'd prefer, but shutdown makes up for it. The design is very nice. Slick looking box, and very clean looking. I've had some trouble getting the brightness to stay down when I adjust it down while it's on the battery, but that may be because I don' know if I'm doing it correctly.  I've only had it for a week or so now, but I'll come back in a month or so to input any updates/revelations.UPDATE 1: Still running great. As others have said, the mouse pad does tend to get a little 'sticky' when your fingers are wet and the battery life is more like 2+ hours. Not so good. But still lovin' it. UPDATE 2: Can't get the laptop's power saving settings to work right. The screen brightness goes up no matter what I try to set it to. May be the Dell power saving software b/c this feature works fine on my wife's Sony Vaio. Aggravating. UPDATE 3: Fixed the video brightness problem with an Intel driver update. Works fine now. UPDATE 4: Laptop was on the fritz for several weeks then about a week or two ago, it just wouldn't turn on. Probably a bad motherboard because power and battery are good. Only 3 years old and I lost data too, unless I'm able to recover it. This is the second major problem I've had with a Dell so no more Dell's for me!","Date":"May 12, 2010"}

My experience on the phone with Dell trying to get basic info was sooooooo frustrating I am returning the laptop.I do not ever want to deal with Dell again. I spent 45 minutes trying to find out which model was in the box I had received (not wanting to open it until I was sure I wanted it). I was told by sales support that my question was far too technical and I required tech support. It took me 45 minutes for someone to tell me \"the laptop you received is an Inspiron 14R\". Gee, that's extremely technical information!!! I can understand why it was so confusing for sales support particularly since I had the receipt, the order #, the customer # and ALL necessary info.What followed this mess was another 90 minutes trying to get a CRA (credit return authorization). Ostensibly, one is able to return a Dell laptop but the reality is quite different.I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with this horrific company. All the calls were routed to either India or Phillipines - I was lied to, hung up on and lied to some more. I am outraged and hope that Dell goes out of business. They really suck and should be ashamed to even use the word \"support\" with regard to their phone services.I am going to write a letter to the State Attorney General regarding their fraudulent return policies. I am also considering recording the phone conversations (need to check on the legality of recording calls that are overseas - I may not be required to follow US law) and sending it to Dell mgmt and the FTC. I think Dell mgmt would cringe if actual calls were published on the internet as the lying and obfuscating is so obvious and ridiculous.

{"Title":"never buy any dell, trust me.","Author":"Jeff","ReviewID":"R2PZ928BPF1KY9","Overall":"bad","Content":"Dell has a long reputation of not being able to keep their machines cool. After just 3 months, my computer would overheat to the point of automatically shutting off. I've had to take it apart, pull the heat sink off the CPU, only to find that there was almost no thermal paste, and what was left had the consistency of dried out gum. Also, the heat sink makes an arc, passing from the CPU over the graphics card part of the motherboard. The heat from the CPU just gets passed on to the graphics card, so my GPU is always about 15 to 20 degrees hotter than the CPU, which gets up to 80 degrees with just internet browsing! Horrible design.Also, the battery dies after 2 months. What's the point of having a laptop that you have to haul around the power cord or else it dies after 5 minutes?Dell lies about battery life. They said it would last 6 hours light use, 4-5 hours moderate use, and 3 hours with heavy use like gaming. Lie. When I first bought it, it lasted 1 hour with heavy use and 2.5 hours with light use. Then, like I said, the battery completely died after 2 months.Never buy a dell, period. This is not a one off situation. Search the internet about dell overheating and dell skimping on hardware. You'll find lots of results.Also do a search on how horrible their customer service is.","Date":"May 26, 2013"}

{"Title":"It is not so much using a Dell, as it is tricking it or fooling it into doing what it is you really want it to do.","Author":"American Dragon","ReviewID":"R28YFCZW82A1Y6","Overall":"bad","Content":"Original Review Made On August 2010 after one month of using: (originally one star)Original Title: \"Too Many Hardware Problems\"After purchasing this laptop, I discovered that there were missing dell drivers.  So I had to install all of them right out of the box.  When the headphone or speaker cable is plugged in the laptop, sound still came from the speaker on occasion.  So it required some immediate driver updates.  The speaker sound is horrible compared to other laptops (non-Dell), so you better always use speakers or headphones.  I'm not going write any comments about the OS because that's not what the review refers to.More audio problems:  screencasting does not allow recording from the speakers, only from the microphone, but I need both, because I make many tutorials, how-to videos, and presentations for work.  After reading about many other people having the same problem as me, I discovered it is because of the Dell hardware and drivers.  It turns out all Dell computers have this problem, except the Studio line of computers.  This is not a Windows 7 problem at all, the OS works just the way it's supposed to.  If I knew this very powerful laptop can't do something as simple as screencasting, I would have never purchased this laptop.  So I'm currently using an external USB sound card and it works just fine with Windows 7.  I can't blame Microsoft for the design of the OS, I can only blame Dell for using shoddy hardware when building the computer.  This was my first and last personal computer by Dell.  I have always used HP before this computer for home use.New Updated Review Made On October 2012: (now two stars)After first purchasing the laptop, nothing was functioning right as well as lots of junk software pre-installed, so I had to re-install Windows 7 (which I always do on new computers) on the brand new computer; this was two years ago. I recently re-installed Windows 7, three months ago, and re-partitioned the hard drive over the summer and after getting everything set up the way I want, it seems to be working optimally. It was a pain to get the sound drivers to work right again (sound drivers seem to always be a problem on Dell computers), especially the ability to record from the wave-out function while screencasting, so you have to be willing to fiddle around with different software for it to work right. For some reason, after using a second sound card software and hardware, that fixed the problem with the original soundcard, so be prepared to get upset with this \"scumbag\" computer, but it should work eventually after tinkering with it. After two years of using it, the battery only holds a one hour charge and I have always allowed the battery to charge and discharge on it's own daily and nightly. Other than that, the computer runs just fine.  The speakers in the computer have always been lousy, so always use headphones or a real speaker system. After reinstalling the OS, video games seem to be running great on this computer as well.  Dual operating systems running via VirtualBox seem to keep up with the amount of memory and cpu power without slowing down.  Since this is a two year old computer, I would suggest to find a more powerful computer for this same cost or less cost, which is completely possible as of now.\"It is not so much using a Dell, as it is tricking it or fooling it into doing what it is you really want it to do.\" --Hunter Cressall.","Date":"August 3, 2011"}

{"Title":"Adamo not that great","Author":"Rick","ReviewID":"R1HADYS95YEZDA","Overall":"bad","Content":"I just received this laptop yesterday and at first look I was impressed with the overall look and build quality.The second I powered it up for the first time, the fan went nuts! It was spinning at full RPM speed which isn't normal on a cold start. I thought this would soon go away but after 30 minutes of web browsing and the laptop at a great temperature the fan did not slow down one bit. Fans are normally supposed to adjust the speed to compensate for the computers temperature but this laptop failed to do so and it got really annoying hearing a turbine sound constantly. I called Dell, the representative tried his best to help and after 30 minutes of troubleshooting trying to resolve this problem (flashing a new bios), he decided it was a better idea to just receive a replacement unit. I'm thinking alright, no problem as long as it doesn't have the same issue or any other kind of issue. Takes 15 days to get my new Adamo. After the call with dell I lightly used the laptop for about an hour and realized that the bottom potion of the laptop that is attached to the keyboard unit was popping out. Another annoying problem that not only I, but other Adamo users that reviewed this laptop have. If it wasn't for the fan issue or laptop falling apart this would definitely be a great laptop. It's fast and pretty but it lacks what should be standard on every luxury product, quality. I've purchased hundreds of products over many years and have never needed to make a single return on anything, until now. I guess I had just gotten lucky having a reputation of purchasing Zero defective products and never needing to make a return. I have nothing against Dell, still have full confidence in their products. Don't be afraid to purchase this product, Dell has great customer service and won't shy away from leaving you satisfied.Coming from having a macbook pro to this, I must admit, apple's build quality is superb and never disappoints.

{"Title":"Alienware... not all it's cracked up to be.","Author":"P. Orand \"Tomcat Tweaker\"","ReviewID":"RW3S49PU2OG8G","Overall":"bad","Content":"First off let me say my 1 star approval rating is based on my 1st Alienware system. The first night I got my Alienware M17x I had to call technical support because the Cyberlink Power DVD 8 software produced a series of horizontal lines across the middle of the screen. I was on the phone with tech support from 8:00pm-12:00 midnight the first night. Alienware Technical Support was very helpful and got this problem resolved but the bottom line; I was on the phone all night. The next day I went to a friends house to watch a couple of videos and before we finished watching them, all of my desk top icons had changed to a generic Windows format and were inoperable. This issue took over 8 hours on the phone with technical support to resolve. These system/software problems continued to persist and \"evolve\", as quoted by tech support, for almost two weeks. After two weeks of nothing but problems I had spent a total of about 40 hours on the phone with technical support. The last day of ownership of this system I spent 13 hours on the phone with Alienware technical support and customer service. One time that day after being on hold for almost an hour Alienware customer service hung up on me. After all these problems, and I've only mentioned a small portion of them, I finally got smart and contacted Amazon's five star customer service. Amazon gave me the option of a refund or replacement! I opted for a replacement because I believe this is atypical of what Alienware produces. I wanted to give them another chance. Just a little more detail about the excellent Amazon Customer Service.... I contacted them 4 March 2010. This was a Thursday, and it was mid afternoon. By Friday, 5 March 2010, they had a new Alienware system on it's way to me via Federal Express. By Saturday, 6 March 2010, before 12:00 noon I had received my new Alienware M17x. The Amazon customer service represenative I spoke with, 4 March 2010, even seemed genuinely concerned that I get some sleep after I explained to her I had been up 13 hours on the phone with Alienware tech and customer service. Amazon even gave me a refund for the return shipping after I called them and gave them the return tracking number. This was something that was totally unexpected. I checked with my credit card company online and the refund has already posted as of, 8 March 2010. Outstanding job Amazon! I've had my second new Alienware M17x system, Amazon shipped to me, for two days and I've done everything I could to check it for faults. So far this system seems to be totally problem free. I'll come back in two weeks or so and if it's still problem free I think I'll rerate it four or five stars. Alienware/Dell Customer service could learn something for Amazon. If you want to buy something from a company who will stand behind the products they sell Amazon is the best choice. I think they're better than Wal-Mart. Thank you so much Amazon. Your up there with the stars. You're stellar!!! Sincerely, Paul Orand","Date":"March 8, 2010"}

There was no technical support available for at least a month during this period when I was trying to get the machine to play the installed software World of WarcraftIt has never lived up to expectations, (it wouldn't even play the installed software).  I have had many long (hours) of conversations with technical support including 2 onsite repairs..I was able to use it for Civilization 4, which had very low requirements.  But the power cord kept sliding out of the back of the machine which eventually caused many, many problems and an incredible number of hours on the phone with technical support.

{"Title":"Do not purchase the M17x (or any other alienware pc)","Author":"Brady R Faist","ReviewID":"R2E3K4PG0AEVYN","Overall":"bad","Content":"First of all, let me say in plain english, Do Not Buy an M17x or any other Alienware PC.I remember that once upon a time, dell was a great company. They built quality consoles, they had the warranty that set the industry standard, they cared about their customer support. It is clear to me that these things no longer matter to Dell. A big name and customer loyalty brings us back time after time. Over the past decade, I have given them dozens of referrals and direct purchases, but in the year since I purchased my dell M17x 8GB with dual Nvidia 260M graphics in SLI and an Intel i7 processor, I have actively scuttled just as many purchases by telling all about my personal experience.Its unstable. Out of the box, brand spanking new, it barely even qualifies as a paper weight. It took me 3 days, and probably 30 hours to get through simply downloading and installing window's updates, firmware mismatches all kinds of errors and stuff that i'll get into later caused me so many problems that its not even funny. If your top of the line(or at least above average) gaming PC can't even run Mcaffee or your own on-board Aliensense programs, then how the hell are you going to run dragon age, fallout, league of legends, even counterstrike or NES Emus?So, what kinds of problems did I experience? The laptop will power down completely without even attempting to shutdown windows and completely without warning. The screen goes solid white with a streak of random pixels near the bottom. The computer freezes... FREEZES. I haven't seen that since High-school and Pentium 3. and these errors can occur with or without an obnoxiously loud tone blasting me in the face for a minimum of 3 seconds while i try to hard off the PC.The obvious issues. Well, first of all there was an obvious NVIDIA driver conflict with something on-board. since alien-sense is the only non-standard program that comes pre-installed, i choose to blame that, however it doesn't really matter. after trying 5-6 other Nvidia drivers I find one that doesn't crash my computer every 30 mins like clockwork. Issue two. Poor design. The screen is too far back, the external shell gets too hot, too fast thanks to poor internal cooling, mother-board has no internal sensors on-board, inferior components like the SSD that they charged me to install but has a SLOWER read/write speed than my last HDD. Also the \"break me\" button at the top right has no tactile response, no toggle and no \"oh i didn't mean to break my pc, UNDO\" button. see below.Less obvious problems. the \"break me\" button also called \"stealth mode\" instantly insures that you will not have a moment's rest until you figure out what exactly stealth mode is and why you never-ever want to graze that button. Stealth mode is dell's commitment to green in action. when you touch that button, it will instantly shut off all graphics cards except for the one built into the i7(which cant handle much) underclock your CPU, shut down anything that is drawing power from a USB port, kill your wifi, bluetooth, even your keyboard lighting. anything to conserve power, except of course toggle down the brightness on your monitor. you need to use window's settings to do that. and before you ask, no. you can neither disable, nor change the settings of the \"break me\" button, and no. once \"break me\" mode is initiated, you can't turn it off. you must unplug the pc, power down the pc restart the pc, go into the Bios for the PC, mess with the settings re-enabling all the stuff that is disabled(like your USB port and hybrid graphics), plug in your pc and restart it. first of all, the creation of such a button on a GAMING PC is just dumb. next everything it does, you can do through settings or by unplugging your externals, windows calls this \"power management.\" third, there is no way to make this setup stable. i need at least one GPU to run windows for more than 5 minutes without it crashing, period. hence the \"break me\" button.also if the laptop comes unplugged, perhaps you foolishly wanted to present a project or surf the web while watching TV you must restart your computer in order to re-enable hybrid graphics, i guess the battery just can't provide that much power. I do get an NVIDIA GPU though which is handy if i'm not interested in gaming or doing anything processor intensive. it should be noted that i needed an alienware patch before, under some circumstances, the power supply that came with the PC was recognized as \"the proper\" power supply. as if i happened to have a compatible low-watt version hanging out at home and i thought \"gee, all computer parts are interchangeable\" derp.presently, my alienware pc is more or less stable. but, needless to say, i came very very close to sending it back before everything clicked. i say more or less because it can still glitch out when i push it and every once in a while when i don't. so i say it again. Don't buy an Alienware M17x. I hear good things about ASUS, Lenovo, and even HP if you aren't obsessive about high end graphics.","Date":"November 28, 2011"}

{"Title":"Alienware is JUNK","Author":"Lance W Turner","ReviewID":"R3EQ3CVP39116D","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had the Alienware M17x for almost three years.  I'm trying to get a few more months of use out of it before I take a hammer to it and then set it on fire.I'm not very tech savvy and I'm not a gamer but I spend a lot of time online.  I wanted the fastest laptop available for that simple task so I ordered the Cadillac version of the M17x which set me back nearly $4,000.  For that much money, the thing should perform flawlessly even if you drop it off a cliff.Since I've owned this POS, I've gone through three power cords, spent approximately 30 hours on the phone with Dell \"support\", had three different service visits to replace the motherboard and other components.Despite all that, the M17x overheats causing random shutdowns every hour or two.  Two or three times a day the screen will just go blank and I'll have to do a forced shutdown and restart.  It's ridiculous.You would be wise to not chalk my experience up to getting a random lemon.  Too many others here and elsewhere have had the same or similar experiences.The bottom line is that Dell/Alienware are putting out outrageously overpriced pieces of junk.  If you buy one, there is an excellent chance you'll hate yourself for it.My actual rating is negative 5 stars.","Date":"May 7, 2012"}
{"Title":"Faulty hardware.","Author":"Brian","ReviewID":"R37V64Q33KK8IH","Overall":"bad","Content":"First let me say I did not buy this laptop from Amazon. I bought it directly from Alienware and I'm writing this review to warn about possible problems with it. I bought my m17x on July 24, for the first two months it was fine until one day it just wouldn't load for some reason, the screen was just black. I had to call them up (since it's under warranty) and they sent a Dell technician out (he was professional and nothing negative about him). Then it started freezing and wouldn't come out of sleep mode. Dell had to send a technician again; they replace the video card and the LCD panel. Now, it's making this high-pitched beeping/buzzing noise that has given me headaches. I have sent the computer back to them to fix this problem, had the hard drive and motherboard replaced, but it's still making this awful annoying noise. The next step will be a system exchange. That means they give me a used computer that they couldn't fix before, it's a shame that I paid for a brand new computer, got a faulty one and now I am going to get another broken one. This laptop is a poorly designed, faulty laptop, do not buy.","Date":"December 12, 2010"}

{"Title":"This laptop starts giving problems in less than a year","Author":"RJ","ReviewID":"R8B68DBP173MK","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this laptop directly from hp. In less than a year the battery died, the left mouse pad button was loose, the key board in the upper right corner became unattached, and the laptop made this weird buzzing sound. Luckily the warranty wasn't up yet so I received free repair. However, it wasn't long after the repairs that it started giving problems again (the same problems minus the keyboard detachment). I've had this laptop for 3 years. The left mouse pad mutton eventually fell out and now the mother board has crashed (not before costing me hundreds of dollars for repairing it the second time). Two of my friends have the same laptop and they both had the same problems as I did (they have also had their laptops for roughly the same amount of time that I have). One of them is still using hers but I doubt that will last for much longer. I definitely would not recommend this laptop to anyone.","Date":"February 17, 2013"}

I didn't like how the glossy plastic made for constant cleaning, but I could live with that. The screen was smaller than what I would have liked, but it was fast and had enough memory for my needs. However, after about 18 months, the laptop stopped booting. It only did this for about a day and I thought that the problem had worked itself out. In April of this year, The laptop completely died, and the laptop wouldn't charge anymore. I had the charger and battery looked at, and they were fine. I was told that the motherboard was completely shot. HP's customer service offered to replace the motherboard for $330. When I asked about getting a extended warranty after the repair, they told me that I could only get telephone support for it because it is too old. It's only two years old! The customer service reps are only about getting you to buy this or that item or service that won't help you with anything. I was expecting to get at least 3-4 good years out of this, but what I got instead was a nice paperweight. I will NEVER use HP again, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone!","Date":"July 17, 2012"}

{"Title":"Terrible overheating problem; no support","Author":"Craig Konieczko","ReviewID":"R330QKVAWVQVR1","Overall":"bad","Content":"At first I was in love with what seems like a decent Mac replication for the PC world. I could even live with he annoyingly loud fan. But within 3 months my laptop would simply shut down or go into sleep mode, and couldn't be restarted for several minutes or longer. The instant sleep is unpredictable and incredibly disruptive because it occurs without warning and always in the midst of a simple task such as writing in Word or updating a PPT deck.Google HP laptop overheat and you'll find this is a pretty pervasive problem across HPs dv line. Worse, HP seems to blame Microsoft and offers a quick fix of adjusting OS settings which does nothing. Independent posters on support forums seem to blame the hardware. Given the fan noise and the way the machine shuts down without warning from the OS my money is with the hardware. Am thinking HP engineers built in an anti-overheating cutoff that forces a sleep if the laptop gets anywhere near a hot temp. Shame, since the laptop never feels all that hot when it goes down. I also use a cooling pad which helped for a while but now no longer makes any difference.","Date":"November 29, 2010"}

{"Title":"Turn and RUN from this HP","Author":"GordyTB","ReviewID":"R21RHWBGP82RVV","Overall":"bad","Content":"Research the documented motherboard issue on the HP Pavilions before you buy!!!!  I thought for many years that HP was a trusted reliable brand.  I spent $1200 on this HP just to find out 13 months in that there is a motherboard issue.  This unit overheats easily (often without you being aware) and you will lose your motherboard (and your investment will be lost). The dv7 has the same overheating/motherboard problem that the other pavilion dv series exhibits.  If you buy the unit anyway (or have already purchased) watch carefully for signs of problems BEFORE the 1 year warranty expires.  Motherboard problems can present initially as odd issues such as power problem (powering off, turning off while booting up, etc).  ALWAYS use laptops on a hard surface.  In this case using a cooling surface didn't prevent the problem but often this can help you avoid issues.  Good luck!","Date":"July 13, 2010"}
{"Title":"Craps out after about a year","Author":"J. Edison \"ExTerminator\"","ReviewID":"RC1GBFQI8G9ZR","Overall":"bad","Content":"Basically what happens is this laptop works amazingly for about a year, then all sorts of problems start showing up right after the warranty expires, and HP then charges you out the ass to fix. Major problem I ran into was the overheating: the vents aren't directly over the GPU or CPU, and so if there's any sort of dust build up AT ALL, or lack of a cooling pad for too long, the whole thing overheats and basically just melts itself. This obviously requires you to replace the motherboard, which HP will do for you for about $400. Second issue, which I just recently ran into EVEN AFTER GETTING THE MOBO REPLACED, is that the power connector on the motherboard is awful. If you torque the power cord while it's plugged in, it'll pop loose on the inside, and your laptop will no longer be able to receive power from an external source: meaning you have until your battery is dead to backup and save everything on your laptop. Still trying to sort out this most recent issue, but I would have to recommend people who expect a laptop to last more than a year (as I hope most people would), steer clear of this model.","Date":"February 20, 2012"}

I know that I'm not stupid, but a fair amount of things have happened to this PC that make me raise an eyebrow at it's hardware.Issues (in order-)1. The ac adapter died.After 11 months of good computer service, my adapter died. The replacement was roughly $95.002. The fan broke.After a year and a half (from the time I bought it) the fan broke and was hitting the side. Since I was still under warranty, HP covered it.3. The battery went badOver a year and a half the battery didn't hold a charge for more then 30 minutes. OH! And I had to talk to about twelve people from HP, and seven told me warranty covered it, the rest said it wasn't the battery was about $80 I believe.4. My computer had an error and would not respond.Exactly a week after my two year mark (warranty expired at that time) My computer had an error that made it not respond. When I called HP it would cost $300.00 to repair it. After slewing through countless internet help sites I found something that fixed it...in two minutes.5. My computer had a different error that told me my windows was counterfeit. HP put me on hold for an hour, but as soon as they had my information (telling them I was out of warranty) they all but hung up on me. I called Microsoft and I had to hold a little longer but my computer was fixed...FOR FREE.Honestly this computer has had far more problems in two years then computers I've had to five.
