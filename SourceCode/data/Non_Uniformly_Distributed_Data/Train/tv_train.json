{"Title":"Good Alternative to Large CRT Screen","Author":"TT","ReviewID":"R3O7R39EWT76O2","Overall":"good","Content":"While shopping for a large screen television, I had considered the 32\" and 36\" Sony WEGAs.  However, this 43\" Sony projection TV had key advantages over the CRT WEGAs.KP-43 Advantages: Thinner  (shallower depth) than the 36\" WEGA; Lighter (about 100 lbs) than the  36\" WEGA; and Larger screen viewing area (43\" vs 36\").CRT  Advantages: Wider viewing angle (both vertical and horizontal); and Shorter  minimum viewing distance.Although the KP-43 projection TV has a larger  screen, it is lighter and can be moved more easily.  It also is a good  choice for apartments or other smaller living spaces.If picture quality  is critical to you, then you should be aware that you may lose detail in  the shadows since the black levels do not seem to be reproduced as  consistently or accurately as a professional monitors.  To calibrate  your TV for your viewing environment, I recommend renting the \"Video  Essentials\" DVD.  In general, you may need to decrease the PICTURE  (contrast), BRIGHTNESS, and SHARPNESS settings to achieve the best picture  quality.  With the factory settings, you may notice blooming and additional  noise.  You may also notice all the noise from traditional cable and  broadcast signals.  Therefore, you may wish to subscribe to digital  services.  There is a single component video input on the TV, which may not  be enough if you have digital cable and a DVD player.  You may need a  separate component video switcher to accommodate multiple component video  sources, or you could sacrifice some picture quality and use S-Video  connections instead.","Date":"December 15, 1999"}

The 32 to 36 screen was going to be the perfect size given my family room deminsions. I was considering the Sony WEGA XBR, Toshiba, and Misubishi. Then one day as  I walked through one of the retail stores in my area, I saw the Sony 43'  Rear Projection Set.  The compact size, the Larger Viewing Screen, Picture  Quality, Enhance Digital Features and The Price, were very impressive.  My  search was over.  It's been a week since the TV was delivered to my home  and I can truly say that it has been a wonderful experience.There are a  couple of things to be aware of:  * Getting all the components connected  can take a little time.* Limited space in the Stand for adding  components.Overall I think Sony 43' is a great investment if your  considering 32 to 36\" TV's. You'll get excellent picture quality at a  better price point.","Date":"March 14, 2000"}

{"Title":"Studio dwellers - there is hope!","Author":"\"vachicago\"","ReviewID":"R1GCR9R88GZDTZ","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a GREAT TV!  The picture (depending on source) is phenomenal.  The size (video picture and physical object) does not overwhelm you.  The TV can be viewed comfortably without being on a TV stand.  The design of  the TV & remote is excellent.  I had an opportunity to view this model  in a store, and my eyes were drawn to its picture quality (and I had to  remind myself of its physical size).This TV fits well in a room size  13x13.  It can be viewed comfortably even sitting a couple of feet from it.  There are five picture modes, 2 of which can be programmed to the viewer's  preference.  Because of its size, widescreen movies are enjoyable (before,  when choosing a video as either VHS or DVD, I would pick VHS if the DVD was  in widescreen format).  There are 4 video displays, three of which can be  programmed to accept 8 different components.Sony has included a lot of  programming choices in this model.  Connecting a receiver, VCR and DVD (and  getting them to work) took about 4 hours.  The TV needs to be off when  connecting a component.  Each component should be added one at a time,  rather than plugging & connecting everything at once and then turning  the TV on.  Apparently the TV needs to 'read' each component before it's  recognized.  The manual was somewhat confusing (because there are usually 2  to 4 combinations to use), but after a component was added you just follow  from the previous example for additional components.  P.S.:  the more  components you add, the more every cable & power cord needs to be  labeled.The remote is comfortable to handle.  There are problem with it  though: 1) in order to use a component, more than just one button needs to  be pressed; 2) you still need to use the remote that came with the  component.This can easily replace a 27-inch to 36-inch TV.  It weights  ~150 pounds and the footprint is small (20 D x 37 W x 42 H).  As the source  of the picture increases in quality, especially from the local TV stations,  this model will be enjoyed more and more.  Then a viewer will have a true  movie experience at home.I chose this TV based on: 1) picture quality;  2) video size & physical size; 3) design; 4) price [remember what you  paid for your current computer? It will outlast it! ] If you can find a  vendor, buy it!  Do not wait!  It will be the best investment!","Date":"December 14, 1999"}
{"Title":"A good TV for small rooms","Author":"Richard J Kelly","ReviewID":"RY52X7FDHB3K9","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased my TV about a week ago.  The picture quality is very good, most people think it is a direct TV not projection. The built in screen protector gives the picture more clarity.  And the TV definently  benefits from a digital source such as satellite tv.  Hooking it up is  somewhat confusing if you have a number of components.  For the money I  don't think you could find a TV of this size with better picture quality.  My only complaint is not with the TV, but with the optional matching stand.  The stand is pretty much useless if you have more than two components.  You cannot put two components side by side because the stand is not wide  enough.  And even after removing the shelf, it is not tall enough to stack  components on top of each other.  The stand needs to be about 3\"  taller and 4\" wider.  Sony's designers obvivously did not put a lot of  thought into the stand when it comes to function.","Date":"January 22, 2000"}

But for watching a DVD or video  presentation I cannot think of another set I have seen as that is as good.  The set is in a nice, compact case, and the cabinet (extra, fits under the  TV) available has room for a DVD, VCR, Tuner, and Cable Box, making all of  those components fit in a neat presentation, without, wires and boxes  hanging off the set.

{"Title":"Excellent SD home-theater set","Author":"DragonBoy","ReviewID":"R3UWV1XQQQP9ML","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased a Loewe Planus six years ago and it is still running strong today.  The picture is clear and sharp with excellent colour, deep black levels and high contrast.  Except for the VGA input, all video sources including the tuner are 480i but get digitized and displayed using a line doubler at 480p, producing a flicker-free picture.  The built-in speakers provide amazing sound for a television, loud and clear with excellent bass though the ports in the back when the Planus is against a wall.  The styling of the set is simple with the screen slightly forward of the side speakers, giving it a more artistic look than the shiny-plastic appearance most sets have today.Some things to consider:- Six years ago, this set was at the top of its class.  It lacks in features compared to modern sets, however.- The set is a CRT and thus very heavy (~90 pounds).- The Loewe brand used to be distributed in the U.S. by Sensory Science, but is no longer.  Expect parts/service to be hard to come by.- The set will only accept 480i through its component inputs; 480p sources (such as progressive-scan DVD players) will not display correctly.  The only way to get true 480p is through the VGA input; there is no DVI or HDMI input.- There are five display options:  - 16:9 = The video is stretched horizontally to fill the screen.  Used to display 16:9 video squeezed into a 4:3 signal.  All other display options are for regular 4:3 video.  - 4:3 = The full video displays in the center of the screen unchanged at a 4:3 aspect radio.  There are vertical black bars to the left and right of the image.  - screen = The video is stretched uniformly to 110% its size.  There are narrow vertical black bars at both sides of the screen.  The very top and bottom of the image are cut off.  Used to zoom in slightly on a 4:3 picture or to eliminate minor letterboxing.  - cinema = The video is stretched uniformly to 120% its size and fills the screen with no black bars on the sides.  The top and bottom are cut off.  Used primarily to remove the top/bottom black bars from letterboxing.  - zoom = The video is stretched uniformly to 130% its size and fills the screen.  The top and bottom are cut off.  The left and right edges are also cut off.- In the above display modes, closed captioning can only be displayed in 16:9 and 4:3 mode.  Unless you are in 16:9 mode, turning closed captions on will reset you to 4:3 until you turn them off.  This becomes noticeable when you set the closed-captions to \"Auto\" mode (captions are off normally, on when the audio is muted).- There is a feature to automatically detect letterboxing and adjust to the appropriate size.  However, more and more television shows and commercials are in a widescreen format.  Especially during commercial breaks the switching becomes noticeable depending on the content.- Picture-in-picture (PIP) location is adjustable.  Input and channel settings for both inputs are remembered.- The on-screen menu system responds slowly but is laid out well.- The remote control is simple, well-organized, and well-constructed.  My only complaint is that the volume up/down and channel up/down are controlled by pushing right/left or up/down on a solid plastic ring.  If you do not push directly left or right sometimes it is easy to change the channel while intending only to change the volume.  When you are on an external input source, this channel change will immediately switch you back to the tuner.- The onscreen connections menu lets you activate the various inputs and modes, but the only way to deactivate them is to reset all the connections.  There are two antenna inputs, three video inputs (1 front, 2 rear), and one VGA input.  The video inputs all support both s-video and composite.  There is an additional component video input that shares its audio with VIDEO 1.  The VGA input supports only 640x480 @ 60Hz resolution.- The power button on the front is a master power switch.  Turning it off disables turning the TV on from the remote.  Turning it on only puts the TV in standby mode.  There is no way to power on the TV except from the remote.Despite its few disadvantages compared to modern displays, the Loewe Planus is a workhorse and stunning both visibly and audibly.  Mine has given me no trouble in the six years that I have owned it, and I see no need to go HD just yet.  I am rating it four out of five stars as it's a superb television for its age, but may not compare in features for its price against newer models.","Date":"January 18, 2007"}
{"Title":"Too much of a good thing?","Author":"Amy E. Jones","ReviewID":"R218RS8136KCTL","Overall":"good","Content":"This set is surprisingly good in the following ways:After owning this set for four months, I am astonished at how BAD other televisions look. When my friend bought a 32 inch WEGA (non XBR) and had us over to take a look, I was appalled by the overdriven picture, extensive red push and large gap between scan lines. It was like watching television through a set of venetian blinds. The same with another friend's Toshiba flat tube set.Further, if you're a gadget-type person. you'll appreciate the fantastically in-depth service menu. Every conceivable internal setting of the television can be accessed through the remote. We have dropped the red push altogether and the picture is considerably more pleasing than when the set was new.Finally, the resolution of the picture tube is so much better than standard televisions that flaws, edits, and manipulations in NTSC sources can easily be detected with the naked eye. This could be a turn-off for some casual owners; other television sets are too blurry and inaccurate to reveal the flaws in a broadcast. Not the XBR! With this set, the difference between high quality and inferior broadcasts is as plain as day.To sum up, this television is superior in every way. In fact, its superiority makes some common NTSC programming look pretty bad. Some owners won't like it, preferring to hide the flaws in the signal by watching through an inferior set.","Date":"April 19, 2002"}

The XBR series absolutely blew me away at 25 ft.  The difference was even more astounding the closer I got.  Nothing, not even the other Sony WEGA models compared to the XBR.  I had to stick my face to within serval inches from the screen in order to notice the razor thin horizontal scan lines. I wasn't really planning on spending that much on a TV but I did not hesitate for a moment to reach for my check book for the XBR. With a little bargaining, I think I got mine for about...  I've had it now for almost a year and I still marvel at quality of this unit. It has more AV I/Os than most users will ever need (component, s-video, and composite) 6 in all.  I even replaced a fairly new DVD player for a model that had progressive scan so I could take advantage of the 480p feature of the XBR (\"fabulous\").  Also, my new XBOX (w/ the HD AV kit) really looks super on the XBR too.Go, shop, compare, see for yourself.  I think only the LCD HDTVs have a better picture quality but they're still too expensive and have very little content to offer today and, I think It'll be a while before they do. So, 4:3 is still the way to go.  Besides, the XBR is HDTV ready.  I just wish that I could have bought the 36\" XBR but it wouldn't fit into my entertainment center.","Date":"December 19, 2001"}

Then you can resize either one you want and as one gets bigger the other gets smaller.  You can also use the picture-in-picture mode while viewing a DVD, VHS, video game system or any other input you have hooked up.  There are also plenty of in-put jacks (6) so you can hook up just about anything you want.  Overall it's just the best TV I've seen.  The ONLY reason I didnt give it 5-stars is because of the price.  I paid the same price thats advertised here but I got the stand included.  Oh ya and it's HDTV (ready) so when all broadcasts go over to HDTV in a few years you'll be all set.  If you can pay the price then go out and get this TV NOW!!!","Date":"February 10, 2002"}
{"Title":"The best 32\" TV you can buy","Author":"\"dan_wang\"","ReviewID":"R1KCG2N428HWLF","Overall":"good","Content":"We've had our 32\" XBR450 for about three months, and the whole family loves it. Coupled with a progressive scan DVD player (we have the Sony DVP-NS700P, also a great product), the picture is nothing short of amazing. Even VHS tapes look better with this TV, thanks to the line-doubling up-conversion process the signal goes through. The sound quality is also excellent--even has treble/bass adjustments--and has surprising bass output for a TV set. The picture-and-picture feature (scalable side-by-side twin views) is really cool; however, be aware that you won't be able to view two channels at once if you get satellite service. (You can still view different sources simultaneously, though.) The unit also has plenty of inputs, including two component video inputs (for high-definition sources) so you can hook up a DVD player as well as an HDTV receiver. While the price is high, for the quality, features and flexibility, you can't beat this Sony for 32\" models. I would recommend this TV to anyone who can afford it.","Date":"March 11, 2002"}

{"Title":"Exceptional HDTV and Progressive Scan DVD images","Author":"Mike Wazonek","ReviewID":"R39GAO25A0TL29","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched RPTV's for over a year and my decision ended up coming down 2 RPTV's - the Philips 46PP9302 and the Hitachi 45F500, I looked at a number of manufacturers including Sony, JVC, RCA, Panasonic. My decision to go with the Philips was based on the extra video processing enhancments that come with this TV and the \"classy\" styling of this unit. As far as the picture quality goes both units provide excellent video but the Philips just seemed to provide a more stunning picture on HDTV and DVD progressive scan. The picture adjustments that can be made to tailor the picture to how \"you\" want it to look are seemingly endless - each input can be adjusted the way you want it. One other notable thing about the philips is the picture with satelitte - This is one of the few TV's with which the satelitte picture looks even good - and when it comes down to HDTV images it is downright amazing. One thing anyone should consider when buying a RPTV is the ability of the TV to provide some sort of screen protection from phosphor aging as I found out from my research there are some Tv's out there that have only lasted 3-4 years before the black bars wear into the screen. I have found that the 4.3 format is what I am using the most to view programming from satelitte so you get the black bars on either side of the screen so the black bar burn in could be a potential problem. The Philips auto format screen sizing is also one of the best available and not many of the RPTV's I looked at even had anything auto period! - you had to use the remote to fill the screen and the resulting picture was quite unporportional. Another deciding factor with purchasing this TV was the dealer I bought it from offerd me an additional 2 years parts and labor warranty as his comment was \" We have very few problems with any of the Philips TV's we sell and that's why we offer the extra 2 years\" . On the downside , (if any) this television as with most RPTVS is the viewing angle - it is very location sensitive - you need to view it sitting down and not to far off center - I have found that about 8-12 ft out and no more than 3-6 ft off center on either side is about maximum.A highly recommemded HDTV RPTV.Mw","Date":"April 18, 2003"}

Even the look of the tv is great because it doesn't look like a big square against you wall.  I only have two complaints.  1.  When watching an hdtv signal you do not have the ability to adjust the screen size (i.e. 16:9).  Some hdtv stations broadcast signals on their hdtv channel that are 4:3 ratio. 2.  It needs to have at least 2 HD Component inputs instead of one component and one RGB input.  It's difficult finding the RGB harness at an affordabe price.  This only is a problem if you are planning to watch hdtv (with hdtv receiver) and a progressive scan dvd player.  Other then these two issues, this is the best tv for the money.

I've owned a Samsung 40 rear projection prior to this, which was also a very good TV, but nothing compared to this JVC bad boy. Some nice features include a DVI jack for future (some present) digital connections, a center channel input (although I've tried it and the sound is less than acceptable, perhaps its my receiver), numerous multiscreen displays including dual tuning for split screen, and most importantly exceptional picture quality. I believe it's the internal line doubler that creates such sharp pictures, or so they say. The clarity is really astounding for a projection TV, and what's more, the clarity is not limited to HDTV broadcasts, but the picture on regular cable is amazing as well. Let's face it, most of us do not spend most of our TV viewing time having access to HDTV broadcasts and receivers. Albeit a fortunate handful, but for the rest of us this television has excellent picture quality across the board. I highly suggest watching the Monsters Inc. dvd with a player using component connections. The clarity is breathtaking, many picutres truly appear to be 3 dimensional. But instead of relying solely on reviews, go out to your local electronics store, and take a look for yourself at this television against other manufacturers. And don't listen to large chain store electronics sales employees, they don't know what they're talking about. Happy shopping!","Date":"December 3, 2002"}

The only downfall is, to have that amazing picture, you have to watch DVD's. I have BEV as a satellite supplier. Most of the channels are clear, except for some, it seems the picture is too big for the channel.Now, I've upgrade from a 10 year old JVC 27\" (Best TV I've ever had). The picture just looks huge, I'm sitting approx. 11 feet away. The ideal viewing distance is suppose to be 9.5 feet.It's just so huge. Now, that may just be because I upgraded from a lot smaller to a lot bigger TV.I've watched approx. 10 movies on it, and WOW, I would never be able to watch them on anything else (unless it's bigger).Other little tidbits, is that when the movie is in letterbox (2.35:1), you still have the black lines on the top and the bottom. You can zoom in even more, but then you lose some of the picture. (my wife is very disapointed with this).To use the full screen when you are watching a 4:3 tv show or movie, the picture seems a little bit stretched, just takes a little of getting use too.If you are watching the TV from angles greater than 30 to 40 degrees, you really can't see very much.Besides what I've mentioned, it is a great TV for a great price, and a big plus, you can use the speakers for the Center channel of your receiver.I've also played my PS2 and XBox on it, it just blows your mind how detailed the games are now.I'm also having a technician coming in to make all the fine tuning on the TV (I don't want to lose the warranty, if I do it myself). So I will let you know if it makes it even better.I would give this TV a four and a half star, it lost its half a star because of the things I've mentioned above. And that is an assesment based on three days of having it. Give me a year, and I'll let you know if it has improved.","Date":"July 15, 2002"}

{"Title":"Excellent TV for being an 'early' HD model.","Author":"Ed Hurtley \"geek\"","ReviewID":"R2FZ3FRH0W8OZB","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought one of these used.  It is my first HDTV (not counting watching HD TV through my computer.)As these reviews are almost all from when the TV was new, I figured I would write a review from the current perspective.First, the downsides:It only handles 1080i, not 1080p.  Plenty for everything I've thrown at it; but those who have Blu-ray may want a 'real' 1080p TV.It has two 1080i-compatible component connections, and one DVI.  No HDMI; although the DVI port works just fine connected to my HDMI-output HD DVD player via an HDMI to DVI cable.It has dual (now obsolete) NTSC tuners, but no digital ATSC tuner.  Therefore, the tuner is essentially useless.The picture-in-picture can handle two HD inputs, but it can be a little flaky.It is a rear-projection TV, which means that it has a rather limited viewing angle.  The picture looks great as long as your eyes are level with the top of the screen or lower, but playing Wii games that require standing up on it are difficult, because the picture dims very quickly when viewed from above.  Likewise, the sideways viewing angle is about 90 to be at full brightness.  It drops off quickly thereafter.Now, the upsides:Finding one used can be cheap.  Potentially significantly cheaper than a new HDTV.The CRT-based projection system means that it doesn't have a high-power light bulb to burn out.  The one I bought is now six years old; and the picture is very bright. (when viewed from proper angles.)In spite of the admonitions that the DVI port isn't computer-compatible, it works perfectly with my MacBook Pro.  It supports 720p, or 1080i; with excellent picture reproduction.But, the DVI port does not have sound, so even through an HDMI adapter, you still have to use analog stereo audio (or use a receiver.)The picture looks wonderful, wether from an ATSC tuner (in a VCR/DVD Recorder, connected via component,) HD DVD, computer, or Wii.The sound, while only stereo with faked surround, is good.  I have found no need to re-connect my receiver.  Good volume, good tone, and enough bass.","Date":"August 8, 2009"}

As we were watching t.v. one night, all of a sudden we heard a loud pop and the screen went blue.  My husband got the manual out and tried to get it working but to no avail.  Unfortunately, I did not buy the extended warranty because I thought that it was covered for more than a year.  I called JVC and was told that I would have to call and have it repaired myself.  We ended up having to send it to a shop and paid an extra $500.00 for the repair.  I was more than upset because in my opinion, when you purchase a $1600.00 television, it should last longer than a year before needing repair unless you damage it yourself, which we did not.  The receipt for the repair says they had to replace an output and install a CRT insulator kit.  I swore then that I would never buy another JVC product again, but was at least glad that our t.v. was working again.  Now, two and a half years later, it is going out AGAIN.  This is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent and I am so disappointed with JVC.  I am not usually one to write reviews, as a matter of fact, this is the first I have ever done, but I felt compelled to do so because I am so disgusted.  For those of you who have already purchased, I hope that you never have to go through the ordeal that we have had to go through.  For those of you considering purchasing, I would look into buying another brand.  Instead of wasting another $500 to have this t.v. fixed for maybe another two years, we are just going to buy another t.v.","Date":"March 4, 2007"}

No, I didn't have the AutoOff function turned on.  Then we noticed the clock was way off all the time (it would lose several minutes a day).  Then, sometimes when we turned the TV on, there would be sound with no picture.  We had to unplug the TV for several minutes, then try again.Finally, after all that, the TV appeared to be fine, until recently when we noticed the menu would go all pink.

I went out to 4 different stores and looked at all the new models, from JVC, to Panasonic, to sony WEGA and XBR. I finally decided on THIS TV. The Model # is Fv300. This is the 2nd model down, (below HDTV) in the WEGA 36 inch line. The features such as infared headphones, picture in picture, \"WoW\" sony simulated surround sound, and a 3D DIGITAL COMB, as opposed to 3 line digital, which appears in almost all average price TV's. The 3D Digital does make a difference, and only beging in WEGA in the Fv300. There are two S video connectors (1 rear, 1 front), and plenty of A/V jacks in the rear (19 of them). Heres the catch, the stand. It cost me 219.00 bucks. Im not sure how much you can find it for, but that is the proper WEGA stand, custom made by SONY for this TV. Let me say...it is one SOLID stand and LOOKS like its worth over 200 dollars. It really does make the presentation. The cheapest quality stand you could find will still run between 99.99 and 169.99 anyway. So I suggest doing as I did, and just going for it. Another issue is the weight of this thing. It's easily 240lbs, some websites claim its more. If you plan on taking this home, your gonna need someone with an SUV or a truck, the box is enormous. I would suggest getting it delivered so you can have them put it right on the stand for you. Me and my brother are weightlifters, so we didnt have too much of a problem getting it in and on the stand , but I would suggest ATLEAST 3 strong people. All the weight is in the front, too. When your past all the setting up, your gonna be happy with your TV. The audio out connection is easy for a home theatre system. I connected a Sony system, and Im attempting to dual connect Klipsch 5.1's. So youve read about the TV, what are the differences in the different models of 36 inch WEGA? FS100- basic model, cheapest, no PIP, No 3d digital comb, No Tru surround sound...basically lacks important features.FS200- Adds PIP, and other basic features, but very similar to the FS100.FV300- This is the model I bought. PIP, 3D digital comb, free infared headphones (which allow you to listen to TV from a distance), etc etc etc...it's loaded.FV500- HDTV model, includes all features of the Fv300, but adds the somewhat \"gimmicky\" HDTV feature. It looks nice but you'll need an HDTV sattalite connection, or some other form to use it. ALso, not all stations broadcast HDTV. It is TV of the future, but its not here yet. Save the 500 bucks. Sony XBR- A step above WEGA, HDTV capable, and 40 inch. Runs double the price of the FV300.Ok, I just wanted to provide you with some insite after my purchase. I'm happy with the Fv300, and I know I made the right choice. Cant beat SONY, Trinitron, and WEGA all in one. I've got two trinitron computer monitors and I was SOLD on the TV just as quickly. They are the best.","Date":"November 24, 2002"}

It finally did, *but* then I saw the new model.  Better picture - a truely amazing picture.  And, imo, much better styling - not that clunky old dark grey box that most TVs have.  Once my wife and I saw shows on the regular cable (non-digital) signal, we couldn't get over how sharp and clear and bright it is.  Popped in a couple of old VCR tapes, and the difference between the new picture and that on our couple of years old Sony 27 inch, in terms of clarity and brightness, was amazing.Couldn't be happier!","Date":"June 27, 2002"}
{"Title":"An owner's opinion...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2CO1S1M9WQVJN","Overall":"good","Content":"We are extremely happy that we purchased this TV. I can't say enough good things about the KV-36FV300.The picture quality is outstanding. The filtering creates an image that will amaze you. Lines of resolution are almost unnoticeable and dot-crawl is minimal. We hooked up our digital cable with S-Video and the picture is excellent. I even saw a hint of pixelization during movement on one of the digital channels. This is of no concern because we don't have the HD converter box, but that shows how close this set comes to HDTV.Used the component hook-up for our DVD player. WOW!!! You can get buy with S-Video here but you'll not acheive what this TV can do for you. (Pay a little extra for the component cables!) Sony allows you to select either a 16x9 enhanced mode or Auto for widescreen dvd's and I've found the auto mode allows a bigger picture in widescreen with no sacrafice in picture quality. There are multiple sound and video modes fore each input to tailor each program, so you don't have to mess with settings constantly. Once you get the Clear Edge VM (velocity modulation) and the DynaBlack settings set the TV never stops blowing you away.The sound is impressive! It has a 15-watt subwoofer for deep bass when using just the tv speakers, but I prefer my Yamaha theatre system most of the time. The wireless headphones were a nice surprise! The quality is better than expected but the range is limited. These are great for watching those late night games when everyone's asleep. (sports fans, are you awake?)TV broadcasts through cable, particularly live sports, are simply outstanding. DVD signals are even better!!! And you can't find better sound from a TV anywhere else.Unless you want to struggle with an HDTV (at least until analog signals are outlawed),  BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!!(Advice: ...have it delivered, it's worth the money.) Cheers.","Date":"October 12, 2002"}

This review is anonymous purely from the privacy point of view. What I like about this TV is it seems to work.  The large number of inputs is extremely useful, two S-video and two component video, I think there is the traditional 75 ohm cable connection as well.  Switching the input also switches the audio output.  So if you are like me and run the sound system using a separate amplifier and speakers this simplifies life enormously for wiring, the number of inputs required on the amplifier and for choosing the sound source on the amplifier. Picture quality is reasonable.  I used to use a Sony 20 inch Wega which has the best picture quality I could find.  The LCD picture quality is comparable and certainly watchable.For two people watching it had some very interesting side effects.  Because it was so slim we were able to throw out the old TV table.  Move the TV back closer to the wall.  Move the sofa a bit closer and reclaim enough room behind to put in another book case.  It doesn't seem to dominate the room as the old television did.The 16:9 aspect ratio is very nice when you have 16:9 material available.  DVDs seem to come in native 16:9 and wide screen stripe across the middle to show on a normal TV.  This TV set allows you to resize the picture within some limitations.  There are more options for resizing on the s-video connection.Although this machine supports 480p subjectively the picture was not much different from a DVD source.Wish list, at this price and with this much flexibility it would be nice to play my Zone 2 PAL DVDs back in PAL. Note that LCD screens are not as delicate as the Plasma displays and are considerably cheaper.  This one is one of the largest LCD screens available.","Date":"November 22, 2002"}

You are right on the field or rink with the players or the wildlife. The one thing I would caution about is that your TV viewing will increase. High Definition makes everything you watch an experience and the size definitely only enhances it. You do need to have 12 to 15 feet minimum of room between your seating and the set to really enjoy this. A room 18 to 20 feet in depth is ideal. A good surround system also makes a world of difference as most high def is also broadcast in 5.1 surround. You can pack a lot of people around this TV and with the Olympics coming up we expect to be sharing our house a lot. In 5 years we have not ever thought of replacing this set as the quality has not diminished.","Date":"December 15, 2009"}

I bought this thing in September of 2002 for over $700.  It was manufactured in July of 2002.  In September 2004, it went dead, and started hissing whenever it was plugged in.  An authorized RCA technician came to our house and looked it over.  He determined that the flyback transformer was bad, and it had shorted out a transistor as well.  The estimate to replace the flyback and the transister came to $300, and the technician couldn't guarantee that something else wasn't damaged--only that those two components definitely _were_ damaged.  Of course, RCA only provides a 1 year warranty, so it's not covered, and here I am, 23 months from the date of purchase, and I have to go buy a new TV.  The technician said that RCA seems to be having troubles with flyback transformers right now as well, so it's not like I was an isolated example.Stay away from this loser.","Date":"September 22, 2004"}

THIS IS NOT A HDTV!  It will take the signal, but will have to \"dumb it down\" to display.  But that display is absolutely gorgeous: sharp colors, wide viewing angle and NO artifacts.  As for using the display as a computer monitor, I would be hard pressed to recommend it any higher.  As with all viewsonic monitors I have owned in the past, apps from word processing to the newest games are just perfect.  I connected my cable to a media center computer I built, and now use a nifty program called Snapstream that puts the old TIVO to shame!  Now my wife can tape her soaps, easily burn her favorites to DVD, check her E-Mail, surf the web, video chat with her mom, play Tetris (O.K.---she's a little behind the times in her gaming!), find that song she has been looking for, etc----all from the comfort of our bed.  She's now happy as a clam, which any guy will tell you pays the ol' hubby dividends far greater than the sub 3K cost of the unit.  And I must admit, I can't wait for Halflife II on a big monitor with the display settings jacked to the max!  Two caveats:  Again, no HDTV.  Perhaps more importantly, if you are going to set this unit up yourself, you ought be an enthusiast.  Trying the many input choices enabled me to decide on the best option for myself, which proved to be the DVI for the computer, and the S-Video for all TV functionality except for DVD playback, which benefits with progressive scan connections (you know, that red blue yellow thingy).  If you rely on the manual alone, you are apt to be left confused, as it is far too brief and poorly written.  If you feel, as I do, that the PC is the future engine to drive home entertainment, this unit is an excellent partner!","Date":"February 3, 2004"}

However those 780p/1080i HDTV signals are downconverted to 480p.  Same with Progressive-scan DVDs.  I wish I would have known this before ordering.

That's why Plasma's are considered monitors instead of T.V.'s  What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50% of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up, or what others call the RF adapter.

I called customer service and they told me to do a reset and that it was probably my cables. I got tired of calling them and them not helping me so I just lived with the problem. Now, just a little over a year of having the TV, it just won't even turn on anymore. I paid 798.00 for this piece of crap and they won't honor their product. I guess its ok for a 798.00 TV to just stop working as long as its been over the one year warranty mark. This company should have stuck to making microwaves.

Just yesterday I got rid of it. Had a descent picture and was one of the best pictures out there in it's time. The 4:3 mode looked best. 16:9 was too small and the border lines were distracting. Hooking up a game console showed it's limitations as scan lines and other anomalies werealways present.About a year ago I started having intermittent problems turning the set on.. No picture just a pop.. but sometimes it would work fine.It got to the point recently where it wouldn't turn on at all.. Found out that sony had a problem with 2 chip sets on the main power board. A common problem.I was deciding whether to fix it or now.. After shopping around.. I purchased anLG LCD 46\" TV which BLOWS away the sony in every aspect.. It was 1/4 the price and 1/10 the weight.Tube technology is history.. thank goodness. The weight of this TV is ridiculous. In retrospect.. I would not have bought this TV.","Date":"November 10, 2010"}

LCD, plasma, and LED flat-screens just weren't easily available or too costly.  That was 2003.I expected this TV, like most CRT technology TVs, to last for at least 15-20 years.  It didn't.  That's a complete and utter failure by Sony as CRT should easily last decades.As to the performance - it was great sound and picture when it worked.  I have no complaints about the actual performance.  There just wasn't enough of it.That brings me to the real issues.  1) It's impossible to reliably repair.  2) Repairs are expensive even though the parts themselves are under $100 - Sony service is too costly and doesn't come with any useful warranty.  3) This TV is a monster to move or get rid of.  It's 325lbs just for the TV.  The stand adds another 100-ish lbs.  Getting rid of this takes a team of people.  AND - it barely fits through standard room doorways.Be prepared to spend a chunk of $ just to have this thing removed when it does fail.","Date":"June 28, 2011"}
{"Title":"Sony Knows These Units Have Chipset Problems;Don't Buy!","Author":"Eric William Abney \"theshiner72\"","ReviewID":"R35JP22A4Z45KC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased my unit (KV-40XBR800) Sony Trinitron XBR 40\" new in 2003.  Within a year it failed to turn on (makes clicks, flashes the standby light, but does not turn on).  Being under warranty, Sony sent a team of guys (yes, it's that heavy) to load it onto the repair truck.  The unit was repaired, but failed again (this time the warranty was expired) with the same symptoms.  Turns out the reps replaced the defective components with new components, which are plagued with this problem. A quick search on any major search engine for \"Sony Trinitron Flash Error Codes\" will reveal a vast consumer base plagued with this problem.  There is no permanent fix as the parts needed to fix it are themselves the problem; any parts replaced will eventually result in the same failures due to the problem being in the defective part design and/or manufacturing process.  Sony is aware of this, and is probably thankful the warranties on these units has run out.Do not buy this unless you have a team of guys to move it to a place where you intend to throw it away after it fails. Definitely fails the longevity aspect of TV ownership.","Date":"June 14, 2011"}

{"Title":"Best rear projection tv for the money!","Author":"Roy Chan","ReviewID":"R23O7CCGCNG8RW","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: Solid video processing with CineMotion 3:2 pull-down; 46-inch, 16:9, HDTV-capable rear-projector; 480p and 1080i display capability; 3D-YC comb filter; two-tuner picture-in-picture mode; relatively inexpensive.Cons: No independent input memory; tabletop design is an awkward, in-between height; nonremovable protective screen.Summary: I have had this tv for almost 6 weeks and so far, I have never regretted buying it! The only regret is not buying it sooner! In fact, so impressed am I with the picture and the sound that I have already recommended it to a friend who is in the mkt for a new tv. After some research of his own and his own personally conducted \"eye-ball\" test, he came the same conclusion and purchased the set 1 wk after my recommendation. I believe the HD microfocus lens and picture tubes really work to produce a superb picture -- such that it's hard to believe that it's rear-projection and not the standart CRT which are purported to be clearer, but that in this case it's not! Also, the $3000CAD that we paid included the tv stand which makes it a great value when compared to other rptvs of this size. I watch only cable tv on this set and I am still amazed at the picture. I also watch DVDs on progressive scan and am very happy with the PERFECT picture -- which goes to show what it's capable of, given a superior signal. Overall, this a great widescreen TV.","Date":"April 20, 2003"}

There are only a handfull of High Definition channels right now, but watching an HDTV broadcast, makes this set worth every penny. Watching sporting events in HD is like having a seat inside the stadium / arena(This set is a football lover's dream. ESPN HD is the coolest!). We looked at a bunch of different models, including some of the bigger screens, but this one is just the perfect size for us, and the Sony was the most highly recommended by salespeople(they always noted how busy repair guys were with some of the other models). A good store will have HD pumped in on all their TVs to help with deciding which unit has the best picture. The Sony was sharp, the sound was good, and the remote was easy to learn. Also, watching DVDs with the progressive scan is like going to the movies. With the different audio and video setups, multiple inputs(including a convenient front input), and universal remote(included), you'll be very pleased with this set, whether you're watching the latest movie on DVD, catching the playoffs, or watching your favorite show in HD. This one is a good choice.","Date":"September 8, 2003"}

The picture and sound was impressive.  Moving it around was easy as it is not as heavy as it looks.  The manual was easy to read and connecting everything I had on it was simple.  As the years went by I began to notice that the left and right side stayed brighter than the center of the screen giving it the appearance of a layer of film over the screen which was not pleasant to the eyes.  I opened it which I do not recommend you do but I am electronically trained and the parts are very sensitive and can be dangerous to tamper with without little knowledge in electronics.  I dusted of the mirror and screen and gently wiped the 3 lens inside with a professional cleaning agent and the t.v. was back at it's original performance that I was able to enjoy for 8 yrs now until the convergence chips went out on it just yesterday :(  I love the t.v. so much and it has been with me for so long that I ordered the parts to repair it myself and hope to keep it another few years before I am able to save up enough money for a larger better t.v. in the future.  I will update on the outcome of the repair as soon as I get the parts.  Stay tuned!","Date":"January 11, 2011"}

D'Eugenio","ReviewID":"R2VWSF8QAZNMXO","Overall":"good","Content":"I was considering (having narrowed it to) a couple of different well known brands in the six thousand dollar price range.  Having started out leaning towards the bigger name brands the service tech did a fine job trying to keep me in the higher priced models.  I'm not sure who wore who out.  As I read more about the different models I found them to be very similar in their offerings, however, I kept leaning towards not what the descriptions said, but where I felt it mattered most, in the visual presentation of the picture I saw.  I also found that visual presentation to be equally as personal.  I asked others (in the showroom) their opinion and no surprise, I got as many differences as there were people.  For example, I viewed some that looked to be naturally lighter and some darker and some with the hues more sedate than others that were more brilliant. We all saw them differently, yet the specs were all the same.  My decision to buy this Samsung plasma screen wasn't scientific, I bought it because I've had great success with Samsung products in the past and I found the picture to be as pleasing as the more expensive models.  With the money I saved, I upgraded to the Bose audio system and still had plenty of money left to buy DVDs and the popcorn to go with them.  I would strongly recommend this plasma screen and feel confident that you made the right decision.

{"Title":"Amazing set for the money","Author":"Matthew William Cohen \"Matthew Cohen\"","ReviewID":"R1DJRTBKZFGH5I","Overall":"good","Content":"I can't complain about this set at all. I originally had a used Daewoo plasma from sams club and it sucked big time, heated up the room like crazy, and constantly had ghosting. I returned it at sams club and bought a samsung spn4235 at circuit city because they had a promotion (2,700 dollars) plus a 300 dollar gift certificate. They were getting rid of the model to get in new ones. The only thing I was let down about was it was EDTV but I found out HDTV models were a heck of a lot more expensive. When I first got the model it had this weird clayface effect and the picture wasn't what I expected however I adjusted the settings with Avia home theatre setup and I was very impressed with dvd picture. I thought this was as good as it was going to get but recently I ordered HDTV through dish network. I thought the standard channels looked like crap but I was able to set my settings at 1080i and 16:9 and hdtv channels were amazing. The picture was very lifelike and colorful and it fit my whole screen without stretching. I watched the discovery channel and the DNIE option is great for hdtv viewing. The unit does decent with blacks but not the best. The set definitely can provide a great picture but every tv can only provide as good a picture as the source it gets from. My suggestion is if you go hdtv use either component or dvi and avoid svideo and rca cables. The price is great and if your looking to save money and have a good picture I recommend the unit. There is a slight buzzing noise but I haven't noticed it. Don't bother with the side speakers go with surround sound it will enhance your experience much more. Overall a very good unit and I am definitely not disapointed.","Date":"January 25, 2005"}
{"Title":"Bright and Bold","Author":"Dwayne","ReviewID":"R2MFOZO9M7YDX8","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this Plasma for a friend and have had it in my home for 2 weeks. I too have looked at many plasmas in the stores and compared.  I have to say this one has a beautiful picture.  Compared to true HDTV plasmas in the store, this EDTV has a great picture.  It is hard to spend the extra money for subtle differences that are hard to see even side-by-side.  Most of our viewing is cable or DVD movies so I can't rationalize the extra money. Even with a cable input, the picture is great.  It is clear and has little \"noise\" or \"graininess\" considering it is a cable signal.  Friends come over and remark what a great picture.  Internal amp for speakers is fine.  The Virtual Dolby does give good impact to the 2 speaker sound.  For DVD's I use my separate surround sound system.  One thing Samsung forgot on this model are audio output jacks to connect internal tuner sound to your surround sound system.  So many other inputs, I don't know why they forgot those outputs.This is one of the few Plasmas that comes with a 2 year warrenty in home!  The appearance of the TV is perfect in our home and looks great on or off.  We are likeing it soo much, I will probably buy one for myself now that I have seen and used it my home.","Date":"May 19, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent value, good first plasma","Author":"Joel Risberg \"Geek\"","ReviewID":"R2SVYKUFSQ1KEI","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this TV via Amazon in 2004 and have been very pleased overall. At the time it was one of the cheapest 42\" plasmas available at around $2800, and now it can be had new for closer to $1500 thanks to the rapid developments in plasmas. If, like us, you don't have HDTV service or immediate plans to upgrade, it's a good choice. DVDs look excellent and standard channels (we use DirecTV and Tivo) look as good as they possibly could.Keep in mind, though, that this isn't a top of the line and will have some trade-offs. Most notably, the resolution is not true HD even though the TV can accept all HDTV formats and will display them at its own maximum resolution. Also, there are no built in speakers or HDTV tuner, but this isn't an issue when most people will use the unit with a surround system and cable box/satellite receiver. We route all our video sources (DirecTV, DVD, VCR, video game) through a $300 Sony surround system that routes the video into a single cable to the TV and the audio to 6 satellite speakers. If you have HDTV service the set does support the DVI connector but not HDMI, so you may need an adapter.She set emits an audible buzz that's loudest when the unit first turns on, but never goes away fully. It does not have a noisy internal cooling fan, though, as some early plasmas did. The set also radiates a lot of heat and draws a large amount of power -- more than 350 watts according to the specifications.Many people mistakenly fault plasmas like this one for premature burn-in when what they're noticing is only temporary. If you see the shadow of a previous image on the TV you need only watch something else for a few minutes and it's gone.Picture quality will be astounding for those upgrading from a standard CRT TV like us, but it's not perfect. Darks lack clarity and night scenes are often hard to make out. Bright scenes look excellent. We watch standard TV in the \"Panorama\" mode, which gradually stretches the square image to fit the rectangular screen. We prefer this to watching with gray (not black) bars on the sides of the image, but that mode is available too. DVDs will display in full 16x9 widescreen mode and look beautiful.","Date":"September 26, 2006"}

The resolution is FAR superior to any other 4:3 NSTC bigscreen on the market - no jitter, no blurry horizontal lines forming the picture (even up close), super-sharp colors and no ghosts. I play Blu-rays through an S-Video input and DVD's through my XBOX360 S-Video input and the clarity and color is absolutely superb - about as near as HDTV as you can get without paying for it. I currently watch HD TV with the included up-convert box from my cable provider and it looks amazing!! All PIP functions are great too - especially the split screen that allows you to watch two things at once with no distortion - this works extremely well if you have a WebTV, video game or computer hooked up to one of the four inputs so you can surf or work on your computer or play video games and watch TV at the same time!

I've had this set for 2 years and have come to learn is does have problem. When you adjust the volume, an image of a volume bar appears on the screen. Over time, this image will burn itself on the screen. Make sure and select a set that lets you turn off the volume control image or moves it around on the screen to avoid screen burn-in.After weeks of reading about HDTV I came to the conclusion that eventually, you simply must make a choice and go with it. I feel like a made the right choice with this set. Viewing DVDs, the image quality looks every bit as good as I remember seeing it in a theater on the big screen. Older movies don't look quite as good but then again, they don't look bad either. For example, a new movie like X-men 2 is stunning while an older movie like Silverado is not quite as crystal clear. One nice surprise, regular cable TV looks very nice and the settings on the set allow you to display \"normal\" 4:3 format in the wide-screen mode with little notice of distortion.  The back of the set offers many connection options. While the set is heavy, it comes with hidden casters that make it easy to move. I was somewhat concerned about the condition of the set on the day it was delivered as it was freezing cold and I worried that might harm the set. I let it adjust to room temp before I powered it up but the convergence was fine. Right out of the box I was totally pleased with the picture quality.I want to add that my set came fully assembled.

I currently work in the TV industry in Hollywood. I know my TVs. I know picture quality.After EXTENSIVE research on HDTVs and widescreen projection televisions, I bought the Toshiba 51H83. Just do yourself a favor and visit a local electronics store and see for yourself: the picture quality is crisp and vibrant and it stands out head and shoulders above all other rear-projection TVs. While most rear-projection TVs tend to be dark and difficult to watch from angles not directly in front of the TV, Toshiba's proprietary technology is much more forgiving and provides a more immersive experience.Also, the sound quality of the speakers is fantastic. They have great depth and range (something uncommon with most TVs) thank to SRS WOW, which makes a mere 20-watts-per-channel over achieve. I own a 700-watt surround sound system that I now combine with the TV's excellent speakers, thanks to the ability of the TV to use its speakers as the center channel when in surround sound mode.And it, of course, has all the features you would come to expect from a high-end TV (PIP, etc.).I reserved writing a review until I used it for some time, and after almost a year, I'm as in love with it as I was the first day I bought it.Disregard the reviewer who gave it one star, the television comes completely assembled, unless, of course, you buy from the same guy that sells cigarettes from his trunk.","Date":"November 16, 2004"}

Although it theoretically handles 1080i, it's too fuzzy to usefully perceive much more than 720p in practice.The biggest problem I have with this TV is actually a significant design flaw.  Apparently, Toshiba thought they would be cute and put the remote control sensor inside the TV, behind the projection screen.  That's fine if you're using a remote control from across the room.  However, if you want to set up any sort of hardwired remote control system (e.g. a computer controlling all the hardware in your entertainment system), you're kind of stuck because any placement of the IR transmitter that actually works also blocks part of the the screen.  The only real option appears to involve drilling a hole in the TV and putting the transmitter inside somewhere.  This falls squarely under the category of \"clever tricks that seemed like a good idea at the time\".  Guess it's time to drill, baby, drill.  *sigh*","Date":"February 4, 2012"}

First off, know that you have to assemble this television.  What?  Are you kidding you ask?  NO!  You have to assemble this television.  I bought the tv from my local Rex electronics store and I took it home expecting to be able to watch it that night, but it was in the box in pieces.  I called the salesman at the store and asked him what had happened, I figured it was an error, but he said that was the reason the price on the tv was so low.  Toshiba is cutting labor costs by putting the tv parts in a box and I have to assemble it like prefab furniture.  Un-Freaking-Believable!  I have to figure out this diagram with lenses and mirrors and somehow manage to put the whole thing together with my own tools.  I finally got it put together and everything is captioned in Japanese.  The audio works fine, but there are Japanese characters all over the screen that, as best as I can tell, are subtitles.  They do not appear during commercials, only during a network broadcast so I can only guess they are subtitles as I don't understand Japanese and cannot imagine what else they could be.  Again a phone call to the Rex and again the standard \"you got the tv cheap, what do you expect?\"  Lastly, I cannot watch anything after 8 p.m. on this tv.  If I try to watch tv after this hour, it will play for 2 or 3 minutes and then a message comes up on the screen, in english this time, suggesting that \"It is late.  Why don't you spend time with your family?\" and then it shuts off.  I have no family.  What else do I have besides television to keep me company?  I tried taking the television back and the people at the store told me that because I had assembled the tv poorly, they would not take it back.  I am now stuck with the tv.  I have denied the charge on my credit card and called Toshiba to see if they will assist in this matter as I have been completely screwed.  I will post again on this forum if I get any more information.","Date":"February 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"BIG TV, has all the current features, user friendly","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R24YCNQPVYMDJM","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is a strong solid performer.  It's Consumer Report Magazine's #1 ranked projection TV.  It has all the up to date features a HDTV needs ... it has the DVI option for HDTV, has Component Inputs for your DVD player, has S-Video for your satellite or similar, has several standard A/V inputs for your VCR or game system, etc.,.  It has everything you need for your basic entertainment system.  Additionally the picture quality is one of the best for a projection system.  But be weary of that concept, this TV is huge...57\", and with this amount of size, the picture quality on \"smaller\" objects is not going to be super crisp or sharp using even a satellite digital feed.  But that holds true on all TVs this big...I think.  So for example when watching basketball and you get the half court view the players are not real super sharp ... you can't really see those little details like face features, etc.,.  You know it's KOBE but you can't pick up the eyes, etc.,.  But for \"regular\" shows that usually don't have such small images, it's wonderful.  Toshiba has made the remote and TV use very easy and user friendly.  You can easily access video 1,2,3,4 etc.,. for the various electronic components you have.  So all good.  BUT ... one drawback was the amount of time it took for delivery from Amazon.  It took a month although the initial advertised estimate was 1 to 2 weeks.  I notice now, though, it says 1 to 2 days, but I notice it's coming from J&R not Amazon and the shipping jumped like $200 so maybe that isn't an issue now.

This is what motivated us to purchase this TV even though we had read alot of negative feedback from buyers who experienced breakdowns soon after purchase and long waits for part replacement.  We shrugged off those reviews by rationalizing that out of the thousands of people who buy this TV, probably only the ones with a bad Toshiba experience take the time to write one.  One week after buying the Toshiba however I turned on the TV and when the screen just showed solid green I had the sinking feeling I should have listened to the nay sayers a little more closely.  It is two months later and all I get is \"the part should be shipping Monday and then it will be 3-5 business days after that\" followed by \"I'm sorry sir, the part should be shipping Wednesday\", and finally, \"It's not going out this week but we show it should be shipping on Monday\".Toshiba customer service was unable to provide any help at all and they generally don't see a problem with someone spending $2000 for a T.V., using it a week, and then having them wait weeks and weeks to get it fixed.  Again, it is a great T.V. if your are willing to risk having it break and waiting months for a replacement part.  I would strongly advise anyone thinking of buying a Toshiba projection TV to think twice and read some of the things other people have written.

Other than the slow shipping, when arrived, it was amazingly easy to set up, with automated focusing to line up the 3 cathode rays.  The picture is incredible.  We don't even have cable or satellite, using just an aerial antennae, and still, just an incredible picture.  The image is even viewable from side angles without much degradation of the picture.The one gripe I have is that for some unknown reason if a wrong button is hit on the remote by accident, it has changed the default input setting from antenna to cable.  Mostly a minor annoyance.  Other than that, the menus are easy to navigate and the front panel with the video 3 inputs are nice.  Component video on the back is really nice with a progressive scan DVD.  Makes a big difference!  I'd recommend it to anyone and am pleased so far with the quality from Toshiba.  Other information, we've had the tv about 3 months now with no issues, paid 1799 through Amazon directly, shipping was very slow though, took about a month and a half total.","Date":"December 9, 2003"}

Since much of the TV we all watch is not broadcast in widescreen, viewing in 4:3 is required if you don't want to add 20 pounds to every actor/actress (well, that might not be all that bad these days..) or stretch scenery to where it looks unnatural.DVD's look AMAZING, especially if you have a DVD player with a DVI output.

Sony is the closest competitor; if you manage to set the pic correctly there should not be any difference. Switching to satellite from cable supposedly improves pic quality. Since I bought it just yesterday, I cannot say a lot about my experience - the pic is truly great.However, some also complained about the bad Samsung customer service. Moreover, the bulb needs to be changed every 8000-10000 viewing hours and one can probably do it (according to the manual) without calling the service personnel. The bulb costs around $250. Some customers had a bad experience with the bulb within the first few months of its operation.Overall, I tend to have no regrets about the purchase and really looking forward to the experience.

We both enjoy DVDs, and we believed we would come to enjoy the set's extra quality.  The set seemed to outperform all the other 32\" flatscreens (CRT-based) we looked at. The price was good for the features supplied too.Well.  The set just fits our cabinet (the TV has wing-like speaker panel projections), and the image quality with our CD player and VCR is stunning. We have digital cable, and for the high-number channels (those >100), we get terrific picture quality. The sound from the extra-wide cabinet's wings is also quite respectable.  This is convenient as my wife gets frustrated turning on all my assorted audio gear to produce TV sound.However, for the lower-number CATV channels, the incresed screen size makes cable signal imperfections more obvious.  I bought an exotic power conditioner for all my components to offset noise, but the CATV signal is still lousy. Apparently, with some digital CATV services, the lower-number channels are delivered in analog format and are subject to a lot of distortion.  All this makes a good case for satellite service(or a better capital improvement program by the local CATV supplier to make the system digital end-to-end...{Hope some product manager from Cox reads this some day}).The TV set also accepts memory sticks.  I have a new Sony DSCV1 digital camera, and it's fun to plug in the memory sticks and watch slide shows.The set has lots of programmable features, an easy to read manual, and a high-tech remote.  Regrettably, my CATV remote does not talk to this TV.We've had this set for a month now, and we're delighted.","Date":"September 19, 2003"}
{"Title":"Pircey, but wow!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R33XYNVERF4A3P","Overall":"good","Content":"This is by far the most I have ever spent on a TV.  But I was ready to upgrade my old set, and wanted to buy something that would allow me to eventually go HD.  This set has everything and the picture is simply amazing - HD or no HD.I orginally bought an \"HD-ready\" TV from another brand.  But I returned it because I was not sold on the quality of manufacturing (I had what apparantley is a common defect in that set).  I paid several hundred dollars more for this Sony set because I am 100% sold on the quality of Sony electronics.  So - while I wasnt happy to pay more than I needed to, all I want is to plug in the set and forget about it.  Given what these sets cost, I am fine to pay more for that peace of mind.In searching around the web, I found one review that mentioned that this set does not show non-HD tv signals well, and specifically that satellite tv signals (which is what I have) look awful.  When I first set up the tv, I had the picture mode set to \"vivid\" and did find the picture to appear quite pixelated.  I fixed this problem by connecting the satellite signal through the Monster Home Theater \"power conditioner\" and set the picture display to \"standard\" instead of \"vivid.\"  The picture is now simply amazing.  It's so good, in fact, I feel no need to hurry to upgrade to HD.Bottom-line: a bit pricey, but worth it.  You can probably get a good HD-ready set for less, but if you're going to spend in the ballpark of this set, I suggest you consider manufacturing quality along with picture quality and features.  I've never gone wrong with Sony electronics and am happy even though I paid a bit more for it.","Date":"April 11, 2004"}
{"Title":"The best video gaming TV there is. Period.","Author":"\"electrofunkchild\"","ReviewID":"R11J1JBDOPUX5H","Overall":"good","Content":"HDTVs come in many forms these days, and they can get quite confusing. LCD, CRT, Plasma, Projection... you have many options to go with if you're planning on making the HD jump. But if you're like me, and are an avid video game player (past systems to the new crop), you owe it to yourself to scoop up this TV. I have many friends that have different brands of HDTVs and I also work at an electronics refurbishing place that sees its share of TVs through its doors, I can fully attest to Sony's quality. No other brand comes close to the sheer perfection of the colors and picture on this set.First of all, please have at least 2 friends handy whenever you pick this TV up from whatever store you're buying it from because its the heaviest TV ever made. No joke. It almost gave me an instant hernia. This baby has 7 inputs of all varieties, 2 components and 1 DVI input. Being that this is a 4:3 TV, and not a 16:9 widescreen model, let it be known that your black bars will not being dissapearing from your favorite DVDs. If you're strictly a DVD buff, this TV is probably not for you. Likewise, if your into watching TV, more specifically an HDTV signal being transmitted in 720p or 1080i, this TV is ALSO not for you. Your picture will be letterboxed, not only on the tops and bottoms, but also on the sides in some cases. This is because 720p and 1080i signals are meant for 16:9 TVs and take advantage of that aspect ratio. Don't get me wrong, DVDs actually do look GREAT on this set, its just this TV is so high quality it brings out ALL the imperfections when viewing movies in progressive mode. Plasmas and the like do a better job of hiding these imperfections and smoothing out artifacts. Movies in 2.35:1 aspect ratio look especially nice on this TV, the TV itself has a great built in 16:9 enhanced mode. I tend to find movies that have lots of action and people on the screen at once, look reall good. The Lord of the Rings series and LEGEND look awesome on this TV, some of the best ones I've seen in my library of over 150 DVDs.NOW.... what this TV does do the best is the displaying of VIDEO GAMES! If you're like me and don't give a flying fudge about watching an HDTV signal, or any TV period, this is THE TV for you. Ninja Gaiden in 480p mode is quite possibly the best looking, most fluid video game that will ever grace your eyeballs. The textures used in that game in 480p JUMP off the screen and it's almost as if you can touch them. This TV feels like it has the most insane refresh rate ever, I run my computer games in 1600 x 1200 w/ a refresh rate of near 90 Hz, and this TV seems to be at least that if not higher. Everything just moves so freakin' SMOOTH. Gamecube games run w/ the component cable also look incredible (Check out Metroid Prime). Thanks to the DRC chip inside this baby, now all your older video games can also look greater than ever. The DRC claims to upconvert all 480i signals to 480p -- now I don't know if my Sega CD and Playstation are running in progressive mode, but regardless they look better than they have ever looked on a traditional CRT TV.Couple this TV with a top notch surround system, and you got yourself a killer home theater for under 2000, that would make even your friend with a 60 inch plasma drool his pants. Don't be fooled in thinking just because a 60 inch plasma is 6000 dollars that it's a superior set, because they simply are NOT, they have their uses and advantages, but most of that price tag is for the convenient thin size. Regardless of the HDTV you decide to buy, go with Sony, there is simply no substitute.","Date":"April 27, 2004"}

As for gaming you simply wont find a better 32\" in fact its the main reason I purchased it ,Gamecube & Xbox games look amazing even in the lowest progressive mode (480P),so many details that were lost on my previous analog tv are revealed with the 32HS510, thanks to its lack of visible scanlines and higher resolution tube.  If you don't have a home audio setup you wont be disappointed by the built in sound on this TV, I have a 5.1 audio setup so I wasn't really considering the sound quality when buying this TV But I was impressed by it ,the sound is clean and can be turned up loud, it's also got a built in subwoofer mounted in the rear wich delivers a decent amount of bass. I also like the 'Steady Sound' auto volume option wich attemps to keep the volume at an equal level between channel changes, commercials etc.  DVD's look superb on this set just remember its a 4:3 model so you'll still see the black bars, I'm used to this so it doesnt bother me. The best way to view dvd's is to set the dvd player on 16:9 aspect,Then on the tv options set the 16:9 Enhanced option to Auto,this way it will automaticly enable 16:9 'squeeze' when viewing widescreen content, this actualy increases the overall resolution and it looks great.Bottom line: Highly recommended OR if its to pricey you might take a look at the recently released 32HS420 model,It's a lower priced version of the HS510 with less features (lack of 2-tuner PIP,No subwoofer etc.) but supposedly it uses the same picture tube wich is a good thing =)","Date":"June 23, 2004"}

It ended up costing $350 to fix it.  I'm still not convinced that repairing it was the right move, but that's what we did.  Maybe I just expect too much from these modern day electronics.

Recently, the power on the TV shut off while I was watching the evening news.  A Circuit City technician looked at the problem and decided that one of the circuit boards needed to be replaced. After he installed that board, he decided that another circuit board was needed.  To date, he has spent nearly 5 hours working on this TV and still has not fixed it.  In the meantime, I am now going on my 12th day without the TV working, and it will likely be many more days before the new circuit board arrives since it had to be specially ordered. I use the TV only for viewing TV programs and for nothing else.

{"Title":"Not great for Standard TV: Soft, grainy, compressed","Author":"David Siegfried","ReviewID":"R2K1WK61VKR0E9","Overall":"good","Content":"This model is now discontinued but has been replaced with the very similar Sony model KV-32HS420. I purchased the last one from my local Sam's Club for $650, a great price. It is bulky and very, very heavy (176 lbs.) It nearly killed my neighbor helping me get it up a half flight of stairs. It is so big and deep that it crowds my small living room and feels too close, viewing from 6-7 feet away. After a few days, we got used to that.The picture quality in HD mode is excellent, but the reason for buying a 3:2 set is because 90% of programming is still standard definition 3:2 format, including the channels I watch most such as IFC, CNN, & Comedy Central. This TV upconverts the 420i standard TV signal to 1040i, which effectively quadruples the image density, so that you don't see large pixels. The problem is that in doing so, a lot of compression is used and the resulting picture has obvious artifacts similar to those found in highly compressed JPEGs. Many people won't notice this or won't care, but for me it's very annoying and I find myself constantly looking for the little particles and extra lines that appear in faces and particularly around text. The compression also makes SD images look softer and more grainy than on a conventional TV. I prefer my 20 year old JVC 27\" to this! Wide screen DVDs look much sharper and cleaner, possibly due to the 3:2 pulldown and/or 16:9 enhancement which allows for higher resolution from widescreen sources.If you have a large room and are going to be viewing at a  distance, this might be a good choice, as the artifacts are hard to see beyond 10 feet or so (but the images are still too soft). If you are going to be watching mostly wide screen or HDTV signals, the image is great, but then you might as well just get a 30\" - 34\" wide screen set.  It has no stretch or zoom functions, but you can view 2 sources side by side. The built-in tuner is only a standard NTSC tuner, not an HD tuner, so you can't get over-the-air HD programming out of the box, another huge drawback. I'm not fully satisfied and will probably return it.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

This is not correct. The screen can be set vertical and can swivel back to about 15 degrees.I researched every tv/monitor of this type and size on the internet and settled on this model. However, I ended up returning my first piece to Amazon and am in the process of returning its replacement too. The picture quality on the first one was pretty bad. The lower half of the screen was very fuzzy (both in the TV and PC monitor modes) and the colors bled. The replacement was sharper, but the colors are all off (too green and bright). I painstakingly spent 2 hours trying to tweak everything very late at night(that's when some TV stations broadcast their color test pattern that you ideally need to use), but have not been able to elimate its green cast.The set looks very sleek but of what use is it if it doesn't deliver in the picture quality department?

{"Title":"Plasma qualify without the price tag!","Author":"C. Fernandes","ReviewID":"RPSPW9T1CV40V","Overall":"good","Content":"I first saw this TV at BestBuy and was quite hooked on it. The clarity is exceptional - with a good quality signal input (HD, DVD), you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this set and an HDTV plasma.I did lots of research before finally buying it from a reputed dealer on ebay. But I found out lots about this type of TV (DLP). I won't go into details of DLP, there's a very good site for this: [...]But DLP is what makes this TV so wonderful. Remember, this really is no ordinary Rear projection TV. It has a 100W light bulb - this is the only component that needs maintenance (life span of the bulb is 8000 hrs, about 4 years). The screen does not 'age' or 'burn in' and there's no calibration of lenses, etc. So essentially, when you replace the light bulb (about $200) it's as good as a brand new TV all over again.As for the TV I purchased - it was plug and play. Simply wonderful, even with ordinary (Not digital) cable. (My cable provider is Comcast). The Tuner on the TV, even though sophisticated enough to have fine tuning, did not give as clear a picture as my Sony VCR Tuner (connected to one of the RCA inputs at the back of the TV) - so I watch cable through my Sony VCR. But it's clear enough.I use a JVC DVD player and I hooked this to one of the component inputs at the back of the TV - the picture is just awesome!The sound is not that great, but okay - the TV has this 'BBE' (Bass Enhancement) option that gives a good punch.I was able to program the remote to work both my Sony VCR and JVC DVD player, not bad!Update: I've had this TV for about 3 months before I realized that my old DVD player was not giving a progressive scan output. So I bought a new DVD player with progressive scan output and the picture is even better!Also, where inputs on this TV are concerned, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better TV. This one has it all, as listed below:1) ONE DVI input - you definitely want an HDTV with this type of input, it's the clearest form of HD signal you can get today.2) TWO High Definition component inputs (they can handle 1080i and 720p) - this is also a very high quality HD signal, but it is analog as opposed to DVI which is purely digital.3) ONE regular component input (handles only 480i).4) TWO S-Video inputs5) TWO regular (RCA jack) video inputs6) ONE VGA input used for your connecting your PC to. This is nice if you want to do a presentation from your PC using the TV as a monitor.This TV may drop in price, but is really becoming popular for obvious reasons. If you see it anywhere on sale, go ahead and buy it, I highly recommend it!","Date":"January 12, 2004"}
{"Title":"Wow!","Author":"WT \"the woodshow\"","ReviewID":"R1M793KDA0BDLL","Overall":"good","Content":"I finally took the plunge and purchased the Samsung 50\" DLP. And \"wow\" is pretty much all I can say. The picture quality is unbelievable. I finally understand why everyone is oogling over HDTV. I hooked up the DVD player (an old Sony, non-progressive scan) and I sat there dumbfounded. I started the \"testing phase\" with Apollo 13. Wow. I could tell very little difference between S-Video and Component Video, and while Component gets the slight edge, you have to be picky to care because the picture quality is outstanding either way. Hooked up the digital cable box... and again, two wows! The first wow is for how bad a standard television signal looks! It was embarrassing... I can't believe we've been watching this junk for decades! The second wow is for how much better the digital signal looks.I then ran out and upgraded my cable box to a HD box.... ok, this is a big wow! It's so good it's almost stupid. I sat there mesmerized by this almost surreal picture. Travels through Italy, Hogan's Heroes (who knew this stuff was in HD?), Three Days of the Condor, and the College World Series... it was almost like being there... actually it was better. I may never leave the house!Hookups are great. Plenty of component, s-video, and even a DVI (which I haven't used yet, although my cable box does have DVI, hard to believe the picture could be better). As integrated speakers go, the Samsung sounds great. It has a simulated surround sound mode which I tested with Apollo 13 and, while not high end surround sound, I was quite impressed. This ain't your daddy's tv speaker. Out-of-box experience was as good as it gets. It was well packed, easy to unpack, and everything worked perfectly. The remote will not win awards for revolutionary design, but it was intuitive enough for me to get to everything I needed.My only real world experience with big screen tv is my dad's Sony rear projection. What impressed me with the Samsung compared to that experienece is... you can't get too close (no tunneling), it looks great from the side, from the floor, and standing up.... you do lose a little brightness, but it's still very watchable. It's not as good as plasma, but it's not far off. One of my pet peeves with big screens is the finish on the glass... I much prefer the \"matte\" non-reflective finish of the Samsung. And when combined with the superb brightness, you can watch (and enjoy) the picture even in a brightly lit room.It wasn't easy for me to pull the trigger... I've spent the past several years of lusting over big screen televisions... never passing up the opportunity to peruse the aisles at BestBuy and Circuit City... watching the evolution from rear projection to plasma to LCD... and nothing really impressed me (ok, the plasma did impress me, but the pricetag was beyond comprehension). But there was always something that turned me off... my dad's Sony projection is cool, but when I watch a movie on it, I can see \"CNN\" and \"Live\" burned into the corners of the screen... and then I learned that you can get burn-in on plasma as well. Yikes. Then I saw the DLP... and I came close to falling in love.If you're thinking about going HD and you can afford it, you will not be dissappointed with the Samsung.","Date":"June 10, 2004"}
{"Title":"Think long term -- HD vs. SD","Author":"cotasm","ReviewID":"R2IN3OV2HDMMBO","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought the newer version of this TV (Model# HLN507W, which can also be found at Amazon) from a local store.  It was the DLP technology which sold me on it.  I brought it home, hooked it up, sat down in front of it, and turned it on.  However, I quickly saw why many people (on other sites) were giving this TV a bad review.  The biggest complaint was that a digital non-HD picture (known as standard definition or SD) didn't look as sharp as they'd hoped for a high-end projection TV.  They were right!  So, disappointed, I got up and walked away from the TV towards my wife and said, \"bad picture.\"  She replied, \"I think it looks GREAT!\"  I turned around and it DID look great!  After doing some reading, here are two very important tips that I've learned:1) Distance is key for achieving a good picture from a non-HD source!!!Even the manual gives you a mathematical way of determining appropriate viewing distance.  I've never seen anything like it.  I could see the picture falling apart if I just took a step or two inside the recommended distance, but it looked excellent otherwise.  I should probably note that the distance issue is almost eliminated when you are viewing from a HD source like a HD tuner or DVD player that has progressive output.2) Think long term!!!This TV was not built to impress those who are satisfied with a SD picture.  Any complaints about the TV that I (and most others) have had deal exclusively with a non-HD picture.  This TV's picture when viewing from a HD source is second to none!  It's far better than any plasma or LCD screen I've seen -- thanks to DLP.  The day is fast approaching when all transmissions will be in HD, and when that day arrives, then there should be NO complaints about this TV.  Its HD picture is simply stunning!","Date":"February 5, 2004"}

I picked the brains of salepersons trainers, previous owners, and the internet.  To my discerning eye the DLP technology and the price put plasma tv's to shame.  I mean, it's just about friggin' perfect!  The just about part would have to deal with the 'regular tv' signal.  DVD's look crystal clear!  I can actually see the actors pores in their skin it's so clear.  I am awaiting a time when all regular tv channels are High Definition.  What I wouldn't give to see a football or basketball game in HD!  With this tv, monster cable is icing on the cake!  It's true, distance from the tv is key.  It looks really good in my recliner, but looks even better from the kitchen or down the hall.  Make sure your room is good size for the 50 inch.  If the 61 inch is on your mind, a huge room is what you need.  I purchased this tv at my local electronics store which truly gave me the best buy.  I also purchased Direct tv, monster cable, my wife's tv (ideal if you are really into sports - she gets hers, I get mine).  But I digress.  If I had the choice of a plasma, LCD, or DLP it would be DLP hands down.  Get the stand that goes with it and you don't have to worry about mounting anything.  It's only 85 pounds for goodness sake!  No 50 inch projection is going to weigh so little.  And if you are mounting a 50 plasma to the wall, are you sure that whoever puts it up there knows what they're doing?  Are you willing to put your $10 grand on it?  Stop reading reviews, get the DLP now.  I don't care where or how, just get the DLP.  Last words - 50 inch DLP and Bose surround sound is friggin' perfect.  We watch movies at my house!","Date":"February 28, 2004"}
{"Title":"AWESOME!","Author":"Eric W. Lampi \"ericlampi\"","ReviewID":"R1NP7UAXNKRXXS","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for 2 weeks, I am very, very satisfied.  HDTV channels are fantastic.  I have been a little skeptical thinking that I was going to find something that will disappoint me, but it hasn't, it's one of the best purchases I've made in a while.  I spent a lot of time looking at different models and types of TV, Plasma, LCD etc...  This is half the price and it looks just as good, if noo better than all but the most expensive LCD or Plasma.It's also has a 3rd generation DLP chip, so you're getting the latest and greatest technology.One thing to note, if you buy this TV and think you might want to upgrade the DVD, Samsung also makes 2 models that have DVI out, there is a remarkable difference even from component input.  They run from $200-$250, very reasonable and the results are WELL worth it!It will actually up-res the image to 1080i and process out the jaggies in the DVD.  Simply amazing.  These DVD players also have upgradable firmware.  You download it from the Samsung site, burn it to a CD-R, pop it in and it upgrades the software!  Easy to use, and well thought out.Do yourself a favor, go to a store and actually see it.  I sent back a Sony Wega because of some problems, and I have to say nothing beats a Tubed set for contrast and clarity, but this TV comes pretty close.Oh yeah, it's pretty narrow too.  About twice the depth of a Plasma, and less than half of a regular TV, AND it only wieghs 85 pounds, so most people can manage it themselves...  My 40\" Wega wieghed 300...

{"Title":"A good \"budget\" DLP TV","Author":"Electronix Junkie","ReviewID":"R3UPV1T01JCF1S","Overall":"good","Content":"I picked this TV up at Best Buy in November 2004, and I've been pretty pleased with it.  It's easy to set up and lightweight (approx 70 pounds), and isn't as fragile as it appears.I'm running a DVI cable from a digital cable box to this TV, and the high-definition picture is spectacular, especially for sports.  This TV only offers the 720p HD output, but I've had no difficulties with conversion from the 1080i signal.  The analog signal (non-digital channels), unfortunately, is mediocre - and certain stations that have poor signals (think TBS) look terrible.  It was explained to me that all DLP televisions have lousy analog pictures because they don't deal well with the 480i output that standard TV uses, but it doesn't matter why - just be aware that it is a problem, and if you want a very good picture across the board, this TV does not deliver it.I have a pretty high-end Sony DVD player and I'm a little disappointed in the picture from it.  I'm using good component cables and used a calibration DVD to improve the picture, but I still see a lot of artifacts and fuzziness on most DVDs.  However, I can't totally blame the TV - high-quality DVDs (The Lord of the Rings movies come to mind) do look good.  I guess the TV just doesn't do much to improve an average or lousy signal like the 32 inch Sony tube TV I had before it.The setup is pretty easy to use, and the TV is packed with features (impressive PIP in particular).  Menus are easy to navigate.  My only criticism is that if you have several devices plugged in, going from one input to another can take a good 10 seconds as the TV's \"reaction time\" is very slow when you want to go from TV to DVD to X-Box, etc...Overall, it's a good, not great, TV.  I'm happy I bought it - and if you can still find one (they're 3 generations old, having been replaced by the 5063 and now the 5085) at a clearance sale, it might be your best bet.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}

With the 10% off coupon plus $200 sale the price went down to about $3450 (no tax in Delaware). Not bad at all! With much lower price than most plasma TV with similar size I can still buy accessories like monster DVI cable, HD DVD player and voltage stabilizer. Also fits in my van!The TV is being hooked to Comcast HDTV and to Samsung HDTV DVD player. The picture is awesome and excellent. White color really looks 99.99% white, thing that I believe cannot be reproduced by regular projection TV. Besides, this TV is much lighter than even my 32\" Sony WEGA TV. So far so good.

The picture is pretty darned good as LCDs go--it is very brilliant and crisp, although in common with all LCD screens that I've seen it sometimes is less-than-perfect for dark scenes.

{"Title":"You may want to know more than what the manual tells you...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3TPKQXMF7TTCI","Overall":"good","Content":"I really like the TV.  I like the way the picture looks, considering that I spent $1500, and not $5000.  I've had my TV a few days, so I can't tell you how it holds up over time (I'll be back).  This review is a \"tell you what you may want to know from day one\" as much as it is a review.  I hope I can help prevent you from damaging your projection TV by telling things not mentioned in the manual.An earlier review (different website) gave the TV one star out of five because he said after eight months he had side bars permanently burned into his screen, and he felt the manual's \"don't use 4:3 mode more than 15% of the time\" wasn't enough information.  Keeping this in mind, I never use 4:3 with gray side bars (I can live with the \"Just\" stretch.)The manual says nothing about a break in period (it didn't say \"this TV has new technology and doesn't need a \"break-in\" either).  I've read several internet articles that recommend special treatment the first 100 hours--have the contrast turned down.  This TV doesn't list \"contrast\" but I'm assuming \"picture\" is the same thing.  One said 250 hours (most said one hundred).  Everyone said turn down the contrast (or in our case, I think `picture').  One said to turn down other things (well, you need some brightness, or else no light gets to the screen and that can't be a good break-in either J.  Several articles on projection TVs said \"Wow, after the breakin the picture became really great!\"  My second day I thought it was looking better than the first.  One site said \"don't just turn on your TV for 100 hours and say `I'm done!'\", that the turning the TV on and turning it off (so that the components warm up, then cool down, etc.) was a part of the conditioning.As delivered, the TV setting was on \"vivid\" which has the highest picture.  I turned that all the way down.  I hooked a computer LCD monitor up to my DVD player through an S-video, and ran component cables (red, green, blue) from the DVD player into the TV so I could compare the pictures.  The TV seemed to error on too much red (people skin color), so I changed color temperature to cool, and there was too much color, so I turned down the tint.  This gave people a more natural looking skin color.  This isn't a criticism of this particular model--one website named three TV brands and said they all give you a TV with the contrast (or picture) turned high and probably too much red.  For comic relief, one guy mentioned that the stores put the most expensive TV's in a category on \"vivid\" so they look better than the less expensive TVs.One site said that the large the projection TV, the more likelihood of problems like burn in .  I'm paranoid about the TV logos in the lower right corner if the logo is solid white (I sent ABC an email pleading with them to change to something half transparent so the colors underneath come through.)  News channels with a running ticker at the bottom of the screen-never!  Right now while I'm breaking the TV, I'm not playing any cartoons.  My understanding of the break in is to run the circuitry without a heavy load on the lamps (like driving your new car 50 miles an hour on the highway).  To me, the cartoons are very very colorful, equivalent to playing a normal movie on vivid.  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the break-in?  I hope to find something about this on the internet.Biggest complaint- I've already seen with two of my widescreen DVDs that they don't quite fill the screen from top to bottom (slight slivers of blackness at top and bottom) and none of the zoom modes will fix this.  Those DVD's are now banned from the TV(I'll play them on my computer).  One review site said the problem was that this TV only has four Zoom options, and other TVs have more.  Maybe later I'll get a new DVD player that can send out a signal with various zooms and then I would just put the TV on standard aspect (no zooming) to accept it.  Perhaps this is my biggest complaint against the TV, that the basic \"zoom\" can't make it zoom all the way in each direction.  From reading the manual, I would have thought it would zoom completely.TV gets 4 of 5 stars for excellent price to performance ratio.  I wanted to give 5, but if all this stuff I found on the internet is true, then when I bought the TV, I could have read the manual, turned it on, and misused/abused it during the first few weeks of use.  I don't know how much new lamps cost, or what I would pay for the labor.  The guy with the problem of the burned in side bars said that one would cost $500 total (parts and labor).","Date":"January 3, 2004"}
{"Title":"Gorgeous image","Author":"E. Cove \"arzec\"","ReviewID":"R1MHFF6GFSXN3M","Overall":"good","Content":"Since I just got this, I can't comment on its reliability, but mine looks and works great.  First off, the PT-53WX53 seems to be pretty lightweight - relatively speaking - compared to other 53\" HDTV's.  The image was pretty good right out of the box.  It has some brightness presets, and mine was set to \"Vivid\" which is probably too bright for most situations.  I changed that, and also brought down the color saturation.  Once I did all this, the image looked very good.  All I have right now is analog cable, which looks grainy on many channels.  But DVD's are crystal-clear: sharp, gorgeous color and contrast.  I did a little homework, and a couple of other RPTV brands (Hitachi and Mitsubishi) consistently came up as having superior images, but I think the differences are negligible - only hardcore videophiles could have a problem with the PT-53WX53's image.  I highly recommend this television.Added: I've since upgraded to digital cable with HD.  The regular digital cable images are fine.  But HD on this set is fantastic!  Crystal-clear, great definition and color.  I'm very satisfied with this set.","Date":"August 23, 2003"}

Fortunately, the cable guy who installed my HD box loves his work, and spent about 30-45 minutes tinkering with various controls.  When he was done, I was left with a sparkling, amazingly clear picture.  The one drawback: once you've seen HD, you can't go back.This unit is an excellent value.

{"Title":"Panasonic PT53WX53 or PT47WX53. Why pay more, for less?","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3LMPT47C34NUT","Overall":"good","Content":"If you want a nice HDTV and have the room, I recommend the 53\" rear projection PANASONIC.Take a look at the Amazon reviews, Circuit City (or Best buy, can't remember which has reviews between BB and CC). The reviews were so stellar that I actually bought it sight unseen and shipped it from Amazon. And man!, were they right....the features and clarity is amazing (remember to lower brightness and no game systems for 1st 100 hours to avoid burn-in...also, avoid playing in 4x3 mode with vertical black bars for same reason).When you do all the math, it is cheapest to buy from Amazon (but only with an Amazon Credit Card) becuase it sells for $1499 at Amazon plus $119 for shipping... but then there is NO TAX (most states) and with the Amazon CC you get Triple point for Amazon purchases (and for every $2500 points you get a $25 Amazon Gift code in the mail), so that gets you *almost* enough points for $50 in Gift codes. Even with free shipping promo's or the $100 GC from BB, Amazon beats them becuase of the no sales tax.IMPORTANT: Everything I have read and heard from tech people in the industry (not you minimum wage CC or BB sales clerks) say that Plasma is too young of a technology, doesn't generally come with a tuner or speakers, costs a ton more and has a lifespan measured in hours (instead of years). My research suggests your plasma will last 5 years (and start to get fuzzy in about 2) and the rear-projection will last approx 20 years (but will of course need some maintenance over that time frame). Also, I have also heard that you should stay AWAY from LCD Projection TV (just get the standard 3 gun projector type) becuase the LCD type is driven by a bulb that costs $200-$300 and blows out every 5000 to 8000 hours (but indications are that your first one will happen in approx one year...which seems even faster than the the hourly guestimate). In fairness the bulb (on some models) is user replacable and the bulb may come down in price if the technolofgy catches on, but i wouldn't bet on it.The panasonic 53 inch has a native resolution of 1080 (and I believe you need a converter box to scalle the 720 broadcasts....it does regular old cable without a box , but becuase it is digital the picture ain't amazing with regular cable...but that doesn't matter to me...I wanted the HDTV for DVDs and when I eventually feel like shelling out more $$ for HDTV cable.).BTW, My last box was a rear-projection and died in about 6 years, so I was NOT ready to buy another rear-projection. But after research I found that my old box was notorious for a very high failure rate...there was even a class action lawsuit. I would mention the manufaturer, but it wouldn't matter becuase it was branded under multiple names and they don't make it anymore, so I don't want to prejudice people against a brand becuase of one particulr (defective) 6 year old model. However, I will say the manufacturer was NOT Panasonic. Suffice it to say, that I was all gung-ho for plasma and NOT looking for rear-projection, but after all the research and info I got, rear-projections in general, and the 53\" panasonice model specifically, won the contest hands down !If you have info that counters all this, please post for others to see...These are just my opinions based on my experiences/research and this is a big purchase...the more opinions the better.

{"Title":"Panasonic 53\" HD ready TV.  Best set for your $$ hands down.","Author":"Jeff Simon","ReviewID":"R3M7A9MSGDU21T","Overall":"good","Content":"I had a long time to research which TV I was going for and if you want a theater style experience with lots of great features, and fit it into a budget, get this set.  The biggest consideration in my opinion AFTER image quality (which is outstanding, but that's been dertermined in other reviews) is Aspect Ratio and how the TV deals with the two different formats.  (There are several aspect ratios, but I'm speaking on 16:9 \"theater\" & 4:3 \"television\")  This set does a good job of giving you several basic formats in which to choose from.  If you're looking for a TV that you can completely fine tune your picture with several zoom settings, this may dissapoint.  I found that they've included the perfect mix and I constantly find a perfect aspect ratio for me.  One setting titled \"JUST\" takes a 4:3 image and keeps the center 2/3's in original aspect and gradually stretchs the remaining 1/3 equally to the edges, this gives the most pleasing results for TV viewing.  On another note, Please read the manual for any TV you purchase.  The manual of this set says to not use the 4:3 drop down (which will make a television (4:3) signal display in the correct aspect, but will leave you with bars on the left and right of the screen) should be used LESS THAN 15% of the time.  If you don't you'll get image burn in.  And nobody wants that.

I spent about 3 months researching the field before I made my decision. I made at least 7 trips to Best Buy (not to confuse with bestbuyplasma.com grrrr...) looking at all the Sonys, Samsungs, Sharps, Hitachis, etc.  I have no clue how Best Buy can sell so many TVs these days. Prices are SO MUCH higher there than on Amazon. People either don't do research or too affraid of online purchases. I did pick up Samsung HD DVD player there though, only $20 more than online. I don't remember DVD model, the one that does 720p up-convert and has DVI out.This TV is cheapest you can find in 32\" 720p category that offers tremendous bang for the buck. Some reviews mentioned over-saturated red color, some mentioned flaws in picture quality. This is not true, plain and simple. This TV requires some tunning when unpacked from the box. Duhh... It took me about an hour to go through calibration and tuning. The results are amazing. Use DVI. Use DVI. Can I say it again? DVI is digital connection. Throw away all your fancy Monster Cables. It is unfortunate and makes me feel sad when people say how great DVI Monster cables are. I understand that analog Monster Cables are of high quality while perhaps being too pricey. With digital connection you either have a picture or you don't. There is no \"in-between\": no noise, no color change, no blurring is even possible. I am yet to see a DVI cable that would not transmit 0 and 1. $15 cable from Menards(!) worked just beautifully. Any and all DVI cables are equal.I went with gold plated S-video cable ($10 from Menards) for my older satellite dish that does not have DVI output (waiting for my HD pack now :) S-video is analog signal and requires some care, hence gold.Now bad things (not enough to reduce to 4 stars though): 1. Only one DVI input. I will have to buy DVI switch box.2. Setup: it takes some time to figure out correct set of modes(menus) for true digital (DVI) connection. The trick that helped me resolve the problem was connecting TV via old-fashioned composite cable along with DVI. This allowed for tracking menus even when no pitcure can be seen on DVI input.3. Speakers: I am not a great fan of elephant ears in TVs. TV looks much cleaner without them, fits very well in my not very large room. Combined with ($600) Infinity Total Solutions(TM) 6-Speaker System (TSS-750PLT) this TV is a peice of art in a frame.

{"Title":"4 stars for movies, 5 for PC and video games.","Author":"SpaceMonkey","ReviewID":"R37L8J03A5U98G","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm no expert on Televisions, but I've read enough about them to write a useful review for you.  First off, as stated by another reviewer, the response time (16 milliseconds) is one of the fastest available and should be a big selling point for this screen.  Similar screens by other companies such as Dell for example have response times of 20 or 25 milliseconds.  The higher the number, the more \"lag\" or \"ghosts\" will be seen while watching movies.  Be sure to ask about response times of any LCD screens you look at.  I bought this TV over amazon.com and overall I'm very satisfied.  I mainly view DVD's, video games and surf the internet with mine.  I don't watch television much so I can't give you a review of that.  From what I've read, LCD screens are not the greatest for regular television viewing; however, HDTV will look awesome as soon as it becomes the standard.  Here is the equipment I'm using:  I have a samsung HDTV dvd upconverter player.  It's a newer dvd player that enhances standard dvd's up to minimum HDTV standards (720p or 1080i).  I used the DVI connection via a $100 monster cable which can be found on amazon.  It doesn't pay to own this TV if you plan on viewing anything with composite (S-video) connections.  The component video is extremely better especially hooked up to a progressive scan dvd player (480p).  When viewing DVD's through my player, there wasn't much difference between picture quality using the DVI input (720p or 1080i) or the progressive scan component connection (480p).  This is only true because of the DVD player I'm using; DVI is still the best connection you can get for any TV.  The DVI input for this TV should be a major selling point because it will be used for any HDTV signal.I rate movie viewing 4 stars because of a few flaws.  The flaws can be seen while watching older dvds.  Most movies looked great from start to finish except during certain scenes:  I watched \"Good morning vietnam\" in (480p) and the picture experienced some lag.  The actors lips were not moving along to the audio; the picture was trying to catch up to the dialogue - very annoying.  The same thing was experience while watching a newer dvd entitled \"Cabin fever\" in (720p).  Whenever a movie had fog or rain or mist in the foreground around the actors like in \"Master and Commander\", the image would get somewhat grainy in (720p); however, the rest of the movie looked great.  Aside from that, other movies seemed to look great from begining to end.  All three Lord of the Rings movies looked stunning in (720p) - hardly any flaws; the same was true with all three matrix movies.  Overall, it is a good set to watch movies on, but it depends upon the quality of your player, the connections and the quality of the DVD.  Older dvd's experienced alot of lag along with a few newer ones.  But, a majority of newer dvd's (from the last 5-7 years) looked great.  They looked better than a CRT model - using my set up.I feel that the real great thing about this TV is the ability to hook it up your computer.  You no longer have to sit in front of a little 15, 17 or whatever sized screen.  You can sit on your couch, put the keyboard in your lap, and surf the net on a 32\" just like you were watching TV.  If you use a computer often for the net or typing or even PC gaming, this is definatly the TV to buy.  The computer image was flawless.  I play simcity4 and it looks amazing.  Again, the equipment you hook up can play a big difference in the results you get.  I have a 2.4ghz Dell 4600 with a DVI output.  I haven't hooked up the PC via component connection yet and I don't know if you can. This is more than just a TV, it's a huge computer monitor and this was the main selling point for me.  Highly recommended for PC use.Lastly, video games look amazing as well.  I have my Xbox hooked up through a high definition pack via a component connection.  Games such as Halo, Tigerwoods 2004, Unreal Championship, Splinter cell etc. look crisper and cleaner than on any CRT that I've seen.  I've played xbox on a samsung 30\" HDTV CRT with the high definition pack and this LCD screen still looks better.  Overall, This is a good buy.  I have a few complaints about some movies, but most have no problem with lag.  This could have something to do with the player I'm using so don't let that discourage you from buying this.  One thing to keep in mind is that as time goes on, dvds will increase in picture quality up until high definition dvds comes out.  As soon as that happens, this TV shouldn't experience any lag at all - hopefully.","Date":"June 8, 2004"}
{"Title":"Handsome quality, still takes getting used to","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1P4SYEQTZQ0QQ","Overall":"good","Content":"This screen is a total indulgence for me. I waded through a lot of the jargon to familiarize myself with the technology, but in the end, it was still a sort of irrational decision. The box is huge, but the set is optimally sized, with the case not much larger than the screen. The detachable speakers have stayed in the box, which was a selling point for me. Wish I could have bought the screen more cheaply without the speakers at all. The connections are pretty robust, yet it took me several attempts to bring up an image. I'm neither the biggest geek nor the biggest technophobe, so getting the devices to communicate was less obvious than I may have preferred but ultimately do-able. So many options can turn into a tragedy of riches.Picture quality is quite good but quite different from the blur of a CRT. It's very bright, which works well for dark images, and it gets over ambient light very well. The composite connection yields really poor results, but who really expects to use that? The component connection is far, far better, but even that reveals screen artifacts unknown in a CRT, such as the distortion of lines moving across the screen. Progressive scan DVD players are reported to improve this (I don't yet own one).Without a lot of video sources or comparisons to other LCD or plasma, I can't reliably steer a potential buyer toward or away from this product, but aside from a few minor quibbles, I'm quite happy thus far with mine.","Date":"March 5, 2004"}

All of a sudden there was no picture upon powering up.  Prior to this I found that the clock setting feature didn't work.  Obtaining service has been a nightmare.  Zenith sent me to the closest service center, 30 miles away.  A few hours after dropping off the TV, the service center called to inform me that Zenith told them it could only be serviced by the factory!  Zenith refused to replace it with a new one.  I've been given no idea of an estimated return date.  Other than that, the picture was very nice, programming was easy and the set's attractive.  Plugging in cables was difficult.  There's only a headphone audio out, not left & right channels.  Switching between input devices was slow as was changing channels.  Setting favorite channels was very slow. Update: received TV-picture OK but clock still not working.  Service Dept. said clock chip a known defect, but no date for fix.  Why didn't they send me a new set with a good clock?  After several calls to Service & Customer Service, Zenith agreed to refund the full purchase price upon return (again) of the set.  Could've been much worse, I guess.  Contacting Zenith was easy & the staff were pleasant and helpful, but I still wasted much time on this.  Can anybody suggest a TV to replace this one?","Date":"March 27, 2004"}

{"Title":"Super beautiful HDTV if you have the room for it !","Author":"gtippitt","ReviewID":"R2VAGXLPC179IF","Overall":"good","Content":"UPDATE after 18 months -I've been using this TV with a home theater PC running MythTV software for the past 18 months.  It really is a wonderful TV.  I can surf the web and email from across the room in a recliner or watch TV with really great video quality.  Adding an inexpensive used PC with a usb TV tuner lets this display really show off what it can do!..........I recently bought a SONY KP-57WS510 TV and love it.  It is a 57 inch HDTV.  It only has two major drawbacks.  The first is that it only has an analog NTSC tuner and will not tune in ATSC digital broadcast channels or cable clear QAM channels.  You must use a cable or satelite box or a digital tuner for OTA digital.  The TV is HDTV ready in that it can display 1080i or DVD 480P.  The TV's 2nd drawback is that you cannot hang it on the wall like a picture frame, because it is lots bigger than a flatpanel and weighs about 150 pounds.With a 16:9 HDTV display that is 57 inches diagonally. This is a really BIG DISPLAY.  It is 50 inches wide and 30 inches high.  For a non-flatpanel, it does not take nearly as much space in the room as I was afraid it might.  I was replacing an old 32 inch TV with picture tube.  The display of this rear projection TV is twice as wide as my old TV, but the cabinet does not stick out into the room as far as the old TV did.  The cabinet of the Sony KP-57WS510 is only 27 inches deep from wall to front of display.Before looking at this TV, I had always hated rear projection TVs, because they were fuzzy looking if you were standing less than 20 feet away.  The picture on this TV is not only huge, but sharp and crisp from only 5 to 10 feet away.  If you try to watch it from less than 7 feet away, it is somewhat tiring on your neck, because you must turn your head from left to right to see the entire picture because it is so wide.  When my old 32 inch TV died, I could not afford a new flatpanel that was as tall as my old display.  I started looking at large-used TVs that had been replaced with flatpanels (by people with more money to waste than I have).This TV rolls easily on its own wheels.  The seller and I were able to lift it onto the bed of a pickup truck.  I was able to unload the TV easily by myself at home by using some boards for a ramp to roll the TV from the back of the pickup onto my front porch and into my living room.  In less than 15 minutes after getting home with the TV in the back of a pickup truck, I was watching a DVD on the TV and in awe of its beauty.  It cost me less than the sales tax would have been when the TV was new.","Date":"March 27, 2012"}

{"Title":"6 1/2 years, a few repairs!!!","Author":"Kawa Jaan \"THE GAMER\"","ReviewID":"R2H5XYZEUBCEQY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this TV for about 6 1/2 years. About 3 years ago, one of the convergence chips broke and had to be replaced. Then, 2 years ago, the other one went bust. The total repair cost for both was about $250.When new, we paid about $2700 for this TV. Back then, I wasn't a huge online shopper and I didn't do any comparison to see if I was getting the best TV or the best deal. Anyway, the picture quality of the TV is still pretty good. DVD Movies look sharp and clear, especially in a dark room, and the speakers produce good sound quality. My only other complaint -other than the fact that it broke twice and had to be repaired- is of the TV's remote control. It has not been easy to program the remote with various media devices; even my DVD player, which is also a Sony, cannot be controlled by this remote! Other than that, the lack of an HDMI input is also a negative. But I guess back then when this TV was made (2004), TVs didn't come with HDMI connections. However, the TV does have connections for all the Component Video and DVI devices that you can possibly have, (I have had up to 4 devices connected to it, with the S-Video, Component, DVI, etc). So, overall, this is a good, big-screen TV that produces good sound and picture and, if bought today, is very inexpensive for a 57\" TV.","Date":"December 2, 2011"}

{"Title":"Sony Rear Projection TV Model KP-57WS510","Author":"tg","ReviewID":"R33UTG5EAZJI0L","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this model Sony rear projection HDTV in 2004. It is used daily and often on for several hours. It's 2012 now and I still watch it. But I must advise anyone who has a rear projection tv to keep the rear vents vacuumed and dust free. Dust will accumulate inside the tv and should be cleaned every few years. This also applies to all electrical devices (pc's, vcr's, dvd players) because electrical components attract dust by laws of physics. I'm very ashamed to admit this but I did not clean inside this tv for seven years. It's amazing it did not overheat something or quit altogether. Goes to show how durable Sony made this tv. But I know better now after seeing the inside of the tv. I never imagined how dusty it could be until I removed the rear vent panel. If you have pets as I do there'll be more accumulation than normal. NOTE: if you are not comfortable doing this yourself, hire a service tech if you can. There's always risk of damaging parts or electrical shock from a capacitor or something. But I promise the cleaning will be well worth it and lengthen the tv's life.  I used a soft brush attachment on a vacuum cleaner, gently brushing and lighty touching the dust to stir it loose and into the vacuum. Spray camera lens or eyeglass lens cleaner onto a soft cloth and gently clean the three lamps. DO NOT TOUCH the large projection mirror above because it will scratch just from fingers touching it.Anyway, after assembling the panel and turning on the tv, I was absolutely amazed at the picture quality. 100% better. It was like getting a new tv. The dust had accumulated so slowly I didn't realize the picture had become that bad. As with all Sony equipment, this tv model will provide years of great service if treated carefully and kept clean. Do as the owners manual advises, ALWAYS HANDLE WITH CARE!Enjoy!","Date":"March 23, 2012"}

We thought we were, but after dragging home a 34\" widescreen HD set and running analog cable through it, we were disappointed with the picture. All we wanted was a good set to replace an LCD front projector that was too clunky and noisy to watch DVDs and LDs on anymore. This set gets used 99% of the time as an everyday beater and in the few days since we exchanged the HD set, it does very well -- not as many PIP or POP options as the one we took back, but good enough for someone who'd never had it before. The V-compression 16:9 mode is very effective for DVDs and provides an excellent picture with a 480i DVD player. Haven't watched a laser disc yet, but should be better that the lousy job of upconverting that the HD set was trying to do. Beware -- better have a nice, strong TV stand to put it on.

It makes a consistent high-pitched ring tone when the TV is off.  Sharp says this is common with all electronics, but I've never heard it this loud on any of my other equipment. Because the TV is in the bedroom, the ringing keeps me up at night. We've even had it replaced with no improvement, so now I have to unplug the TV every night.

It's just too small for today's modern human eyes.  For a typical living room, the minimum TV should be a 37\" Panasonic plasma set.  42\" is another good choice, although for most people 50\" would be an overkill.This Sharp 20\" NTSC TV is perfect for the bedroom.  It takes up very little space on the nightstand, and it sports sharp and high-contrast image quality, making watching TV pleasant rather than eye-straining.  This model is not widescreen, but that's ok for me because at 20\", widescreen would have made images too small for me.  This model is also not HDTV, but rather EDTV (extended definition), which it means it fully supports progressive-scan DVD playback.  Hook this up to a progressive scan DVD player -- I have the super-compact CyberHome model I got at Radio Shack for $45 -- and you'll get some great-looking DVD movies in your bedroom.As a secondary TV for your bedroom or kitchen or study, this Sharp delivers great quality and great value.","Date":"September 27, 2004"}

I had just been ogling over a $10k plasma set an aisle away, thinking I would never be able to get a set with such crystal clear clarity and vivid colors. Then, I saw the 42WE610. Sony truly came through with an affordable combination of existing technologies (LCD and rear projection) to produce a value-conscious high-end set.Now that I am through gushing, I have had this set for about 3 months and will attempt a more objective review. I have watched many hours of DVD movies as well as analog, digital and high-definition cable. The only video type I haven't watched is VHS.

Slim, sleek design. Light-weight, proportionate to its size (approximately 45lbs.)Cons: Reasonable angled viewing but still has some problems when being viewed from wide, side angles or from above horizontal (i.e. 90 degrees, or above the set, such as when standing or if seated from a perched position.) Speakers are mediocre but I would think almost anyone buying a set like this has at least some sort of home theater system through which they will power it. Analog cable is a disappointment, not because the set is directly to fault but the resolution of analog cable is so low. The picture looks grainy and just plain unremarkable. If you plan to watch a lot of regular (analog) TV then you may want to reconsider. Digital TV is noticably better and HD TV is great. One last con is that I still struggle with 16:9 aspect ratio sets. It's in between true wide screen and a regular TV so either the scene is stretched and cutoff in places or there is that annoying strip missing across the top and the bottom. That is really a personal quibble though and any set with this ratio is like that.Summary: Without being too repetitive, this is a great set at a great price, given the quality. Hook it up to a decent sound system and enjoy great digital broadcasting and DVD movies. I suggest getting at least a 2-3 year extended warranty since this is still new technology and its lifetime is unknown ...better safe than sorry. Watching traditional CRT TV's will never be the same after you watch this for a while. It is life-like and mesmerizing when displaying high quality DVD movies. It actually puts the theaters to shame since the colors and clarity are far superior to anything they can put on a big screen. I hope to see more technology and prices like this coming out over the next couple years.","Date":"November 3, 2003"}
{"Title":"Worth Every Penny","Author":"Henry H. Pan \"figmund\"","ReviewID":"R1Z0G2ALX9MCEW","Overall":"good","Content":"After spending months looking at traditional big screens, plasmas and the Samsung DLP, we decided on this technology.  I just wasn't impressed with what I saw from the DLP televisions. Few plasmas are true HD, and the DLP image seemed soft to me. The picture on the Sony Grand Wegas is crisp and clean, never soft (unless you want it that way - Sony provides several settings).  One of the greatest things about this type of TV is that there's no burn-in issues, so I don't have to \"zoom\" all the traditional NTSC. I much prefer to have black bars on the left and right than have, everyone look fat. The 480p off a DVD is stunning - and I can't wait to get an HDTV tuner hooked up. The black levels are quite good, it works well in our sun-lit living room, and the viewing angle is very wide. Strangely, the viewing angle gets better after the TV has warmed up a bit.  We happen to have a Sony digital camera, and with the memory stick feature, my wife can watch photo slideshows on the big screen - a bonus feature she really likes.","Date":"November 21, 2003"}
{"Title":"Plasma with Reliability","Author":"David A. Riley","ReviewID":"R1RNR2XN94NZ60","Overall":"good","Content":"If you want to hang your TV on the wall I understand the attraction of Plasma.  If not (I believe the majority of people out there do not hang their TV on the wall yet)this is a real alternative with significant advantages.  If it breaks buy a bulb, not a whole TV as you would with Plasma.  Burn in is very unlikely with this technology, whereas Plasma is very prone to it.  Picture quality is better in my opinion in normal conditions, additionally you do not have to suffer the irritation of pixel distortion that currently is a fact of life with Plasma.There is no comparison with CRT, just the 60lbs of weight and the fact it measures around 14\" in depth make it worth the change for me.  The picture is truly excellent and unlike non LCD projection TV's the light conditions in the room have a minimal effect.  The viewing mode can be adjusted (vivid, standard etc)to taste and used to enhance the mood of a movie or offset light conditions.Freeze frame and PIP are cool allthough I don't see me using them very much, my brain can only watch one thing at a time unlike other people.  One bonus I did not know about when I bought it but love, is that I can insert the memory sticks from my digital camera and watch a slide show of my pictures in seconds after getting back from a trip.If you are a non geek you will love how easy and quick it was to set up, with no knowledge I hooked it up in minutes.If you want to move it any time you do not need to hire a fork lift and three big guys to help you, at a push I can carry it myself limited by size more than weight.At the end of the day it's just a TV and compared to CRT a very expensive TV at that.  But if you want Flat Screen, HDTV, that is big but light and has outstanding picture quality but you don't want to take on the Plasma risk this is one great package.","Date":"May 11, 2004"}

{"Title":"Made a good choice after hours of research","Author":"Travis Dockweiler \"tdockweiler\"","ReviewID":"RVKBGGG4Y7TN2","Overall":"good","Content":"I did hours and hours of research before buying a new television. I was thinking of a Plasma screen but found too many negatives about those. I really hesitated to buy this TV at first. I heard that the bulbs go bad within a month of purchase. Luckily mine has been running for 4 months without a problem.With low quality TV broadcasts you do have a little bit of the screen door effect. It's not that bad at all and you can barely notice it. I just probably sit too close to the television. It's magically disappears when you watch movies, or least I myself just can't see it.The picture quality is amazing with DVDs, especially Pixar films. I don't use the built in speakers much but they sound just fine. I suggest getting a good calibration DVD for this unit, such as AVIA or Video Essentials. It's a pretty good investment.I have a Playstation 2 connected to the TV with component inputs and widescreen mode in games make everything look so much better. I was worried about ghosting, but I have no noticed any of that and I do play fast paced games such as Gran Turismo 3 etc.I'm trying hard to come up with some negatives about this TV. There isn't many at all. When turning on the TV it takes 30 seconds to get a good image, but that's normal. If you accidently turn off the power and turn it back on it takes even longer. Not more than a few more seconds.The remote is well made. The TV has 6 input channels and I wish there was a way to instantly switch to the one you want instead of having to press 'input' up to 5 or so times.I also should note that at first I was worried that DVD players with upconversion and DVI connectors wouldn't work on this unit. They do work just fine, but stayed with my old DVD player when I realized it wasn't worth the $199 upgrade.UPDATE: June 10th 2006Had my first EVER problem with this television. The picture would come up and then disappear after 5 seconds. When I turned off the TV the red light would flash 5 times. All I did was a little research and I found out I needed to replace the \"Lamp Driver\". It cost me a couple hundred and I did it myself. Problem fixed! Dead TV one day and fixed the next!","Date":"October 24, 2004"}

Well, compared to comparably sized plasma and DLP sets, the 42WE610 is inexpensive.Cutting to the chase - This set will appeal to you if:-You desire a very bright screen (this set is BRIGHT!) which can perform even in daylight-You would like a slim TV (much smaller than CRT, about a foot deep)-You see rainbows on DLP sets-You don't have $4000 or more for an HDTV plasma (not EDTV panels which are cheaper)This set's cons are:- a somewhat lackluster black level (which can be tweaked very effectively by either professional calibration or online research)- sporadic reports of problems, which all seem to be resolved as of mid-2004.Subjectively, I feel this set outperforms plasma screens, as the pixel structure is not as easy to see, and for the brightness levels achievable (wouldn't want to burn in that plasma!).I also feel it outperforms DLP, because the picture is less noisy  and there are no rainbow effects (trails of color on high contrast images caused by the viewer's perception of the color wheel which separates 1-chip DLP white light into colors). DLP has slightly better blacks, but they're very close. In my opinion, the Grand Wega generally produces a picture which is less noisy and more \"film-like.\"In summary, anyone would be pleased with this set's overall performance. I haven't regretted the purchase once in over a year.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}

I use it a great deal, even still, and has been nothing short of perfect.  I bought it at Crutchfield, a local tech store here, which matched the price for this item that was at that time discounted at Circuit City (now defunct).  I think I paid about $900 new.  It was $1400 at Crutchfield, but they matched the offer.  Works beautifully still, many years later, and works great with PS3, a BlueRay player, HD cable inputs, and I also added connectivity to my local computer/media center.  Has never let me down.

That doesnt even tell you half the story. Well I have this amazing TV set but in the 60-inch. I bought it back in 2004 when it cost $5,000 dls! yes can you believe that ? I also cant believe I spent that much but could have not been happier. When it comes to TV's Sony is a brand you can always count on, We are almost in 2010 so ive had it and watched it pretty often for almost 6 years and I just barely had to replace the projection lamp on it last week! One thing I also liked about the lamp is that it never caused the picture to go dim or gradually distore the picture quality. That may be inconvenient for some people but I always plan ahead and I had bought a replacement lamp after the 3rd year so I was able to quickly replace it. When the lamp goes out it also has a small red light indicator on the front panel of the TV which tells you that so thats a big plus!Now to the technical aspects of it, the picture and sound quality is vivid, clear and amazing, it doesnt matter if you have a well lit room or a darker living room, One thing I didnt like too much are the 3 different picture adjustments options it gives you, when you try to adjust it from the remote control its hard to really get it just right, but once you get it just right it gives you a beatiful picture. I only tried the HD for one NFL season since it was a lot more back then to get HD then it is now but during that time I experienced amazing HD quality which almost puts you right in there.Sonys are a bit pricier than some phillips, LGs, Mitsubishis and other brands ive seen out there but its worth every dollar. Everytime I walk by the open items section at best buy or see returned items at other stores or online you always see all those other brands expect for Sony. If you are going to spend alot of money on a Big screen TV you want it to be not just good as far as quality but also durable and that is what you will get with sony. Ive always heard many good things about Samsung which is probably the next thing I will try since they are much more affordable now but in my main livingroom I will continue to enjoy my grand wega TV. One other convenient thing about this TV unit is that its very light, you can move it around easily to connect extra devices or simply to move around. The screen doesnt connect much dust and doesnt get affected by it, a small dry towel is all you need to get the dust off and keep it clear.Hope this is helpful to anyone looking to get this particular model. You wont be dissapointed.","Date":"December 25, 2009"}

However I took a leap of faith and purchased one anyway. It took me 2 weeks to finally find one as every store in my area was completely sold out of them (from 42\"-60\") & some store are still sold out to this date. That excited me more as I was not the only person who liked this tv. You can make the pictures the same size in PIP mode which makes for an enjoyable viewing experience as I play my xbox and watch my favorite shows. I have do not have HDTV in my area yet but I did hear it's night and day difference. However most cable company's do not offer a lot of HDTV channels, thus the low cost. But I do watch the discovery channel a lot so I will benefit from it. This tv is HD-ready: Fully capable of high-definition display when connected to an optional HDTV source.

However, this is the only way to achieve your large screen TV's maximum video performance. It appears that it's not only necessary but simply required!

It took hours just trying to reach someone at SONY--they have over 1 hour wait times when you call for technical assitance.  Usually they will not even accept your call if the wait is over one hour long, so it may be days before you get to talk to a tech at SONY just to troubleshoot the problem.

{"Title":"Just bought.","Author":"Altruism Is Dead \"Random reviewer\"","ReviewID":"R2PVVBZV2M32DM","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought this tv acouple days ago. I had been wanting a plasma screen television for quite some time, and when I seen the price of this for alittle bit under $2,000 in a local advertisement I had to take a look at it.When I went there I was quite impressed with it, visually it looked great, the design of the case and the picture quality itself. I asked the sales person alot of question but he didn't really know too much about it so it made me question the integrity of SVA, a brand which I had never heard of at the time.I went online to try and find some reviews and information about it, but could only find these same reviews below on abunch of other websites, which didn't really help at all since you have 2 people saying they like it, and 1 person that posted twice about how it sucks and not explaining a reason why. After abit more research I read that the picture tube is made from a Samsung picture tube. I heard of this before where other companies like Dell import pieces of plasma screen tvs and construct them in one of their factories to keep the price down.After visiting the store again, this time with my brother to decide on final purchase, me and him went over all of their plasma tvs and gave them our own bare eye inspection. Both of us thought that the SVA had a great picture quality compared to all of the other plasma screen tvs they had on display, and in alot of cases it looked even better than alot of the tvs on display.When I bought it, the only thing that was bad was the stand was broken on it (which we recieved another stand) and for being a plasma screen tv and how thin it is, it is very heavy. The other thing is that it has no controls on the tv itself, there is no volume, channel, video select or even a television power on! (Although there is a main power turn on/off) So if your remote control breaks (and you don't have a universal remote programmed for it) it sounds like you'll have to order a new remote.I read from a different review that someone was having problems with the remote control and that it had a \"mind of its own\". I haven't came across this problem at all, either that person had a faulty remote control, or was talking nonsense.But still, like I mentioned before, I have recently bought this plasma tv, I haven't had any problems with it yet, and I had been looking up information about preventing burn-ins since I hear it plagues plasma tv's and I play alot of video games and intend to use it as a pc monitor as well.Also another nice addition was that included ALL the hook ups you need. I am not sure about the exact amount of cords, but it include acouple of the same ones like 2 a/v cords, 2 normal left/right audio cords, 1 component, 1 s-video, 1 pc cord, 1 pc to component (which is really cool), 1 analog(?) cable, and 1 audio (you know like a head phone jack) to left/right audio cord.  I thought that this was very cool since alot of tvs I had bought and other people bought didn't include, or only included maybe 1 or 2 cords.I gave this a rating of 4 because like I said, I had just recently purchased this tv and still am testing it out. I wrote this review to help people get alittle bit more knowledge about this tv since I couldn't find much help about it online either. My biggest suggestion for anyone interested in this tv is to go to a store and take a look at it and compare it to other plasma tv's, make sure to check for burn ins and everything. When I was checking it out at the store they did not have the audio set up, only the picture cables were hooked up, when I got it home and tested out the audio, I was quite surprised at the quality of it since I heard alot of plasma screens with speakers didn't give good quality. But still I run all my audio through my reciever for surround sound, which the majority of people that purchase plasma tv's do as well, so you wont be worrying much about the audio on this... which I believe by looking at it, it has 4 sets of speakers, I could be wrong... but it did give off some nice sound for when I was testing it out.","Date":"July 4, 2004"}

I bought my first HDTV plasma more than a year ago! It is the Pioneer 433cmx with approx 1072x760 pixels. This is true HD, but although the Pioneer works great, it cost me $4,200 total. So now I've learned that the difference between the EDTV units and the HDTV units is the pixels. When you watch a DVD on a EDTV plasma like the SVA unit, it will look slightly better than a HDTV plasma because the pixels on the EDTV unit closely match the DVD and when you play HDTV signals on a HDTV plasma, the HDTV will show a slightly better picture than the EDTV. So is the HDTV worth $2000 more??  I used my eyeball test and compared the SVA Plasma to the other EDTV plasmas in a local store and decided on the SVA. Amazon has a great price and the unit comes with everything, cast iron desk stand, great speakers with base and treble controls, a tuner for cable or RF signals, 2 composite video inputs, 1 component and 1 15pin computer monitor input. I don't use the PIP feature but its there. I use this in the bedroom and its great! comes with a 1 year warranty. Thanks Amazon! I gave this a 4 only because of its weight.

I have friends who have much more expensive units that they bought last year, including Sony and Dell. They are all very impressed with the picture quality. The replay has a slide show on 'pause' and it looks great on the screen. The static picture (10 second slideshow) gets excellent reviews with no flicker or dead pixels. It really looks great. Even in fast action scenes in adventure movies do not cause image issues on the screen. I almost bought a Sony or a Fujitsu since I didn't really want to think or do research about the quality of the unit. One of the costco home workers said that over a 100 had left the warehouse and only one was returned (and it was not returned for a failure). I cannot speak to other issues about customer service since I have not had to deal with them. I have been saving a lot of money by buying dvd's and watching movies at home with this plasma and the surround sound. It is really awesome and I wish I had bought this thing last year when I first saw it. The only issue I have is the component video input via the 15 pin dsub. One of the two silver retaining screws (just like any pc card has) fell out. Therefore the vga connection is not super tight but it still works. As another reviewer mentioned, this unit is heavy and I have it about 5 feet in the air on a hearth. So, only when I have someone help me lift it down will I replace it. Other than that, it is pretty cool. Buy this unit and save the money you would spend for a name brand!UPDATEOver one year later and still going strong.

First of all, the picture quality is sharp and nice unlike some of those reviews saying it has bad picture quality. You can easily spend $1000 more for the same picture quality for big brand names. Second, it comes with everything, you don't need to spend extra money buying necessary part. I use it a lot as my PC monitor with the PC comes with wireless keyboard and mouse. The Picutre on PC is excellent and exceeding my expectations. 42 inch monitor for my PC, it is cool. The unit also has nice design. You can't go wrong with the product.","Date":"May 7, 2004"}

There is no reason to spend 3500 for a panasonic or 5g's for a sony because the quality of this screen is top notch and the low price makes it that much better.  I do agree with one of the other reviewers in that the screen is uncharacteristically heavy, something to take into consideration if you want to wall mount this unit.  Other than that there are only two drawbacks and the reason for the 4 not 5 star rating is that its EDTV and no DVI input.","Date":"July 31, 2004"}

So im quite up to date on all products and tends. Upon reading these reviews for those who have had issues. Sorry to hear that and if u feel spending 2k more money on a brand name makes u feel better then go ahead.I'll keep the xtra money I saved in the bank by buying this product SVA (basicly a rebadged Samsung). I own this Plasma as well and find it's performance is unmatched by any other product at this price point or more and Yes it does use a Samsung plasma screen. The unit is well built. Picture quality is fantastic with DvD and Tv is actually good for cable signals better then CRT DLP or LCOS. Unlike other projection units DLP LCOS and so on this unit has even brightness and colour not seen in rear projectors as well as it doesnt have a beamy picture like dlp and LCOSAs for the other reviewer saying he cant turn it on after shutting it off . It says in the manual DO NOT TURN ON WITHIN 2 MINUTES AFTER SHUTTING IT OF! Might be why u have a issue U need to read the manual This is why they have it. Sure the manual isnt the best but it covers the most important features. Anyway I think u all should give this unit some consideration. In a few years this comapny SVA will be just like Samsung.

{"Title":"Only EDTV, poor contrast, questionable reliability","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"RHEUJB60UIL9V","Overall":"bad","Content":"SVA is a large TV manufacturer based in China, while the \"heart\" of this plasma screen, the plasma panel itself, is made by Samsung of South Korea.  This means two things: 1) questionable build quality and durability, and 2) subpar image quality.You may be attracted by the attractive price on this set, but believe me, there's a reason why it's so cheap.  Unlike state-of-the-art plasma planels from Pinoneer and Panasonic, the SVA exhibits poor contrast, no matter how you try to adjust the settings.  There's also significant pixelation when viewing fast-action scenes, such as sports.  The exterior also feels rather flimsy, which is not surprising given the low-cost market the company builds its \"reputation\" in.For two grand, you only get EDTV meaning the resolution tops out at 480.  A little more money will get you HDTV entries from Gateway.  Given 720p is pretty much a must given how fast the HDTV industry is evolving, I recommend against an EDTV no matter what.  So what if you have a 42\" screen?  Remember the concept of \"dot pitch\" from the computer monitor world?  A low resolution looks especially bad on a large screen.  An older-technology-based screen like this SVA-Samsung is really not worth the savings, because in the long run you suffer, as you find yourself having to upgrade to true HDTV, not the least because all your friends have HDTV!Recommendation:  stay away from this cheap set with poor screen quality and unknown reliability.  I always think that if you are going to spend a lot of money on a TV, you might as well go with a good one.  Sony, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips, Gateway, ... you have many choices that are much better and give you more bang for the buck.","Date":"October 20, 2004"}

{"Title":"Top of the Line - Best of the Best","Author":"R. Guentner","ReviewID":"R3NNKR15C1FIJX","Overall":"good","Content":"I have an 8-year old 50 inch bigscreen that still puts on an exceptional picture. I had found a deal on a satellite receiver that could tune the local channels in HD and connect to the bigscreen with S-Video.  I had decided that I would not upgrade until I found a 60 inch or larger with a better picture.  I saw this Sony on display showing Discovery HD, and had to have it.  Since I got it home, I have been glued to it watching anything available in HD.The Set:  It is an LCD-projection system using a very bright lamp to project thru the LCD and onto the screen. It never needs converging. It is not affected by speakers or magnets.  It has seven inputs for sources such as a DVD player, satellite receiver, etc.. Four inputs (one on the front) accept S-Video or composit video plus two channels of encoded audio. There are two inputs for RGB component sources, and one DVI input for the highest grade connection.  The internal tuner will tune any broadcast tv channel, analog or digital, and offers picture with picture(side-by-side) and can adjust the size of the two pictures to maximize one and minimize the other.The picture: It's like standing at a window and looking at the world.  Simply breathtaking. There are several modes to take less-than-HD sources and fill the screen. With movies on DVD, it's better than the picture in a movie theater. and DVD players are only 480I/P sources.  A 1080I source provides the best picture.The Sound:  The internal sound system provides excellent sound with several modes.  The Trusurround(tm) mode will provide a very good impersonation of Dolby 5.1 surround, minus the sub-woofer. I frequently hear sounds behind me and turn to realize the home theater system is OFF, and I am listening to the TV's sound.  For most people, the onboard sound will be enough.  For those that want all of the theater experience, you will probably want a home theater system. I have a Sony DAV-FC9 home theater system for full enjoyment of movies.Other:  This set weighs 225lbs in it's carton.  Sony recommends no less than 4 people to move it and has provided some hand-holds for that purpose.  It needs a sturdy base to sit on.  Sony's base is overpriced, in my opinion.  I found a nice base from a home theater collection at a furniture store.  It has room for DVD recorders, satellite receivers, or the home theater receiver.  The screen protector is a solid sheet of tempered glass about 3 inches larger than the screen. It makes the set a bit front heavy. Read the manual for more info ([...]  The glass has a front-surface anti-glare coating to cut down on reflections.  It should not be touched, except for gentle cleaning.  If you are watching a dark program(outside scene at night) you may still get some reflections from light room objects, but not overwhelming.To Sum it Up:  I am very happy with this HDTV receiver.  I still have not found a better picture on anything bigger than 60 inches. I apparently am not the only fan.  I had to order it from a local store by placing a 20% deposit and wait for the next shipment. My one complaint, if that, is that with this sharp of a picture, you can see the flaws in lesser programming.","Date":"March 11, 2004"}

No buyer's remorse what-so-ever.  I still have not seen a better TV at this size, and I have looked at DLP, LCD-RP, LCD-directview, plasma, CRT, and also front projection.  Five of my friends have gone out and bought this TV (or the 60-inch version) after seeing it in action at my house.  I cannot say enough about how stunning the picture quality is.The 60-inch version of this TV now uses LCoS instead of LCD, and I think it has higher resolution, so I may wish to upgrade if they ever come out with the 70-incher in LCoS.I have heard two complaints about this TV in the HD forums.  One of which is completely bogus.  The other may be a concern.1)  The big sheet of plexiglass in front of the screen causes too much glare.  This is the bogus complaint.  If they had put a lenticular screen in front to cut down on glare, you would lose both brightness and viewing angle.  Give me the ultra-bright, super-sharp, wide-angle-viewable screen any day and I'll do whatever else can be done to cut down on the glare.2)  The contrast drops off sharply at dark grey.  Yes, LCDs have contrast problems below a certain brightness level.  You will definitely see a sharp drop off in detail in darker areas of the screen when watching this TV.  It is inherent to LCD.  No way around it.  In my opinion, there are at least as many drawbacks to the other technologies (DLP, Plasma, CRT).Go get one of these before they are all gone!","Date":"January 3, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent LCD at a very reasonable price","Author":"LCD_newbie","ReviewID":"RZT7LH1KWLH90","Overall":"good","Content":"My brand new LT26WX84 finally arrived a few days ago. I was so excited. First of all, I have to say this LCD looks very attractive on the exterior. It looks almost as good as the Hitachi 42\" plasma where the front is all black except the speaker grill on the bottom which is silver. Just like most of the other LCDs, all the AV connections are on the side of the unit except the digital DVI-D interface which is at the bottom. There are a total of 3 sets of connectors although I am not sure why the components for Input 1 are on one side while the RCA audio for Input 1 are on the other side. This poses inconvenience if your component cable also has audio, which is the case of my PS2. I have Dish network at home, but no HD yet. For standard definition (SD), the picture quality is slightly better than my 9year old JVC 27\" CRT (my viewing distance is about 8 ft), but it's only on par with Sharp 22\" Aquos. I was slightly disappointed in that. To put things in perspective, you can't expect an HD set to perform miracles on a SD source. The display can only be as good as the source. One thing that it definitly outshines the Sharp is the viewing angle. For the Sharp unit, the brightness of the picture changes significantly with the angle, but for LT26WX84, it's quite consistent (although still not approaching the CRT yet). The black level also appears to be slightly better than the Sharp by a hair.Next, I tried my DVD source. Due to space consolidation, I was using my PS2 to playback DVD video. The PQ is quite nice--vivid colors while showing a lot of details. I am sure if you have a progressive scan DVD player, it will look even more amazing. Nonetheless, my PS2 games also never looked better. I am sure Xbox will do even better since it is HD capable. Regrettably, I don't have an HD source, so I can't comment on the PQ. But, based on what I have seen in the store, it shouldn't be short of breathtaking. The only problem with this set is the red color. It appears that red looks a little bit fuzzy esp. for SD source. I tried to adjust the Tint, and it helped a little. But still, red is not as good as I hope it'd be. If other folks have the same set, I'd like to know your settings. Mine are (tint, color, picture, bright, detail) as follows: -8, -10, +10, +4, +10. Overall, if I were to rate this unit, I'd give it a solid 4 star. It needs some tweakings, but excellent bang/$ value.","Date":"December 30, 2003"}

Dedominick","ReviewID":"R1J8P629486T55","Overall":"good","Content":"I had been eyeing the LED market for a year in preparation to replace by HD Projection TV I bought back in 2003. Samsung was first on my list, but after some independent reviews (CNET, Consumer Reports), I decided to go with LG. This unit has all the bells and whistles at a competitive price point ($1,800 at the time of purchase) and the LG brand is gaining a good reputation.I was concerned about damage during delivery after reading the only other post on Amazon at the time I ordered, but the unit came in a timely manner and the person delivering insisted on opening the box and looking the unit over before requesting my acceptance. While I can see how the stand could possibly damage the front of the TV if significant force was put on the front of the box, my delivery had no issues.Granted, I had not formally seen the display on this specific model when I purchased it. I had seen the 55LE5400 in local stores, but the 55LE5500 was purchased sight unseen. I could not be more thrilled with what I got. I have the TV in a large room with lots of Florida sunlight. A minor tilt of the TV on the wall unit and I have no significant glare. The image displayed on the screen is great. High Def channels are pristine. Low Def channels, while they do show some blocky edges at times, are more than adequate. (The only Low Def channel we need if for some children's shows and the quality is more than enough for my 2 year old.)There are plenty of display controls to fine tune the screen for your room. The widgets are nice, but I wouldn't consider them a reason to pick this unit over another. 240Hz was one aspect I thought I wanted, but the TruMotion 120Hz on this unit has kept up with any fast panning motions displayed. The Clear Voice aspect has been great for late night TV watching when you want to hear the dialog, but don't need the booming car crashes to wake up the sleeping family. Overall I am thrilled with my purchase. I can clearly see the benefit of LED and LG has delivered on its promises. I would recommend this TV without hesitation.","Date":"July 12, 2010"}

To me, I thought the LG and Samsung models were the most consistent from store to store. Both have an excellent picture. It comes down to whether you prefer the glossy (Samsung) or matte (LG). I'll admit the glossy displays can look clearer under some circumstances, but reflections are an issue.  I chose LG.I saw more of the LE5400 in stores but decide to go with this model when a great price came along. No regrets there at all. The display is awesome with HD and Blu-Ray. The SD is better than my 46\" Toshiba. Noticeably better. There is some ghosting when the screen is completely black, it doesn't bother me. With fast action scenes you forget you're watching a television, it's so natural.One great feature I like about the set is the self-calibration process. Piece of cake. I have an AppleTV so I have not tried the streaming features yet. It's a downer that you have to buy a wireless dongle.My delivery from Modia was great. There is a review here that disses the LG packaging and it scared me somewhat. I honestly can't figure out what the guy is talking about. Apparently he has some type of ax to grind with LG or he's a Sony dealer or something.LG makes a great LED for a great price. I would highly recommend the 55LE5500.","Date":"July 21, 2010"}

I am sold on LG, I tried Sanyo and Sony, I looked at several others but this one called out from across the store. Picture was better, sound was better, and most importantly the price was better. I don't regret this purchase ever. Of all the TV's I've owned this is my favorite. Sorry hun. :)","Date":"March 28, 2012"}

{"Title":"Poor local dimming","Author":"BCorso","ReviewID":"R3LDS84TSNXL1R","Overall":"good","Content":"Order this TV without researching it too much, it was on sale for $1600 and came with the LG wireless adapter, LG wall mount, and a LG blu-ray player.The first TV I received had several areas on the screen that were brighter than the rest, most noticeably when the screen was all black. I called Paul's TV and they said they would send me a replacement.The second TV arrived a week later, but this one was also flawed. It was unable to properly process a 1080p signal from my PS3. The screen would flicker on and off for 2 to 3 seconds every 5 to 10 minutes. At first, I thought it was the HDMI cable, but even after using a Monster M1000HD; the problem was still there. The only way to get around this issue was to set the PS3 output to 1080i. I called LG, they had me check a few settings, unplug and reset the TV, and then told me that the TV was defective. So I called Paul's TV again and just asked for my money back.Even when the TV was working, I did notice that the local dimming was pretty horrible. It was obvious the TV was edge lit with dark scenes, the local dimming caused large amounts of stray illumination and blooming into dark areas. It was so distracting that I had to turn off the local dimming and give up on having the deep black levels.I decided to go with a plasma this time and ordered a Samsung PN58C8000 (hasn't arrived yet). After researching, it seems plasmas out perform LED-LCD TVs. If you do get a LED-LCD, I would highly recommend that you get one that is full-array with local dimming instead of the edge-lit; it will help eliminate the stray illumination and blooming into dark areas.","Date":"September 24, 2010"}

They also said products fail - sorry.  DO NOT BUY ANY LG PRODUCTS.  The company has matter-of-factly implied to me they do not care about the consumer and at every opportunity will hide behind legalities to avoid culpability for any problems or failures of their products.  Using a pair of binoculars to watch your neighbors tv will work better than an LG.  I give this product and this company ZERO STARS.  THEIR PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE - BOYCOTT LG.

The padding for the stand was cut by the center post and the styrofoam is to loose around the stand. The outside box was in fine shape on both TV's. I am now out $5000 till the insurance claims clear.If you buy this and are able to pick it up in the warehouse, open it up and check it, remove the stand from the box before transporting.I called LGSERVICE and they confirmed that any external damage to the set will void the warranty.This is an edge lit display and the edge is delicate and very thin. There is no extra plastic to protect it from the rear and the metal front bezel is slightly thicker than a soda can and very flexible.This unit needs a larger box and some non eco friendly urethane foam or higher density styrofoam to protect it in transit.Update 5/22/2010 Full credit has been received.I have since found LG 55\" tv's on display at Best Buy with same problem but the panel not bowed noticeably.Also one Samsung 55B8000 with damage at the rear center of the display dented in!

I use the TV's speakers and I think the sound quality is top of the line.  You can adjust the Bass, Trebble, and balance, while turning on or off features like surround sound.The television IS heavy but not out of the ordinary for its size.

But not without trouble .. this one had geometry problems. The horizontal lines weren't horitontal at all, when switching on the TV,  a smoky white region would appear on the top of the screen just before the picture came. So I exchanged it for another piece thinking I must have got a defective set. Guess what, the 2nd piece was even worse, exactly the same problem as the 1st one, but also when turning on the TV, the picture would appear after a few seconds, and when it did the color tone was slightly green and then after 2 seconds it would come to a normal color tone. This got me frustrated coz I am quite a detail oriented person, things like these piss me off especially when you buy the top of the line model in its class, a Sony. I returned this junk and decided to go for a Toshiba 27AF44 which I got for $275 from BB. I looked for 2 weeks before deciding which one to go with. I looked at RCA, Samsung, JVC & Panasonic. Panasonic was impressive but it has problems with its contrast settings and the picture is way too dark. JVC is equally good but I decided to go with Toshiba based on the results I got from a few people and experts from [...] Never again a Sony !","Date":"December 22, 2004"}

We have found the sound quality great for watching every day TV - but we sometimes have to plug into external speakers when watching DVD's for greater viewing quality, and louder bass (we use the awesome Altec Lansing XA3021 2.1 Speakers - 3-Speaker, Black & Silver - you can buy them through Amazon for about $36 - a bargain!)

{"Title":"Good quality display, best in darker rooms, no HDMI","Author":"Michael L. Koch","ReviewID":"R39V5FVQM9DUME","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for about 8 years, and only replaced the bulb once (and I watch a LOT of TV). The biggest things to beware of are, as with most projection TVs, it works best in darker rooms since the display is not that bright and can appear washed out in brightly lit rooms. The quality of the HD picture is very good, and very sharp. Also, the only true HD output is via the DVI connector - there is no HDMI output, so this TV will not work with some modern peripherals such as many blue-ray players, Playstation 3, AppleTV, etc., which require the HDCP connection that is only available via HDMI. The interface software is based on Windows CE and is a bit clunky, but not too hard to figure out. The whole thing only weighs about 100 pounds, so it's not difficult to move, just awkward if you're trying to handle it yourself. There's an ethernet port on the back, and RCA also made a wireless keyboard that you could use with the built-in web browser to surf the web right on your screen. If you can find one in good working condition for a couple hundred dollars and don't need HDMI output, this is a good unit.","Date":"October 14, 2012"}
{"Title":"Good picture for the money","Author":"C. Tuss \"game lover\"","ReviewID":"R3P1YG2YJX41OK","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV used a few years ago for cheap b/c it was loud (had a bad bearing in the color wheel.) I replaced the color wheel myself, easy to do, for around $100 for an upgraded part with better bearing design, and the TV has run flawlessly since.  I'm still using the same bulb that came with the TV, but I run the lamp setting on Low, which isn't much of a difference from bright. Another reason I use the low lamp setting is b/c the lamps run very hot and high heat is the enemy of electronics, the lamp will run significantly cooler on the lower setting which will decrease the potential for other electronic component issues. I have this thing on all the time as I use it for watching HDTV via Comcast cable with set top box, watching movies on Blue Ray player and gaming on Xbox 360.  Something to note is this TV does not accept 720p signal.  This could be a problem with a couple channels if getting HD reception through Antenna or Sat, but cable all comes through at 1080i in my area, so not an issue for me.  Also most high def devices such as gaming systems and Blue Ray players allow the user to select which HD signal to use.  I have both my Xbox 360 and Blue Ray set at 1080i, and the TV works great for all my needs. Picture quality isn't far off a new Mitsubishi 1080p DLP I had for a few days.  I bought the Mitsu to upgrade, but it was louder in operation and not much of a difference in picture quality, so I returned it and am keeping this one till it dies; or the newer technologies eventually become rediculously cheap.  The design is a bit dated, so it's kind of a sleeper; It always surprises people when the TV is off and I click it on and they see how good of a picture this dated looking beast puts out.  These old DLPs have kind of a bad rep from bulbs burning out etc. but a lot of these are probably attributed to people getting the cheap knock offs, not the genuine Phillips bulbs which are rated for 6000-10000 hours, and possibly beyond using the low lamp setting.  Overall, this TV puts out great picture, is very inexpensive and has proven reliable for my use.  If you are on a budget but still want a large TV with great picture it's a good deal.","Date":"December 23, 2010"}

That was about three weeks ago. And since then my entire family just can't get enough of it.Picture quality is just great - and that's expected. But what amazes me is all the extra functionality with what this TV is packed.1. Video streaming with Netflix. (It also has VUDU, YouTube, Picasa - but I did not try VUDU yet, and YouTube and Picasa work just fine, but I do not need a huge display to view some low resolution videos from YouTube). So Netflix movies available to watch instantly look great. Even those that are not HD quality. I must say that I have FIOS internet connection, so that must be also a component for high quality videos, but as far as this set goes - it does a great job.2. This TV has 2 hi-speed USB2.0 input jacks, and it recognizes not just flash drives, but also USB external hard drives - even with NTFS file format. I tried both - FAT32 and NTFS, and also external drives with additional power source and without it, - this TV recognizes them all. It can play your video files (and other media too) directly from external hard drive! And it supports multiple video formats, including Matroska H.264. It also supports external subtitles for AVI files. I did not test multiple subtitles formats, but SRT works great. It supports standard Latin letters languages and Korean. No other encodings though.I want also to add a few words about design. I use a TV stand that it came with, and it allows TV to be turned both sides about 20 degree - just enough to get to the USB jacks or to additional audio or HDMI jacks that are placed on a left side. The main ones are located on the back panel - which is also pretty easy to reach thanks to that rotating feature of a stand. The rotation is very smooth and requires no force at all.I can't be more pleased with it.","Date":"August 5, 2010"}

There is only slight flashlighting I've noticed when changing inputs but never during any programming, including really dark night scenes from the Blu-Ray.The audio is as good as the 32\" standard TV this replaced.  There are different modes and settings, but it is not going to sound like a 500 watt system.  Keep your expectations realistic.The widgets as of this review include weather, finance, a few games and others ... too many to list but as far as I'm concerned, they don't add much value.  There are NetFlix apps like VUDU and YouTube which work very well. These are worth paying some extra.  When I hooked up the Internet through an ethernet LAN cable, it automatically checked for updates...pretty cool.Aesthetically, the set is good looking and construction seems solid.  All the inputs are located in one place on the back panel ... no front or side inputs.  There are cable guides so you can semi-hide the wiring.  This works pretty well.In summary, I'm very happy with the picture quality, which is why I got this model.  If you don't see any updates to this review, nothing has changed with further use.","Date":"September 29, 2010"}
{"Title":"No Analog Audio Output","Author":"Wallace Guy","ReviewID":"RR50UX3KQM9NR","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture is beautiful.  The frameless glass frame is magnificent.  The speakers are so-so.We went to Best Buy to physically look at TV's, intending to buy a 42\".  Two things became clear.  The best imaging technology (e.g., high contrast ratio, etc.) doesn't really kick in until the 47\" models.  I guess there isn't a big market for high quality / small size TV's.  The other was the fameless frame on this model.  Every other TV in the store, bigger and smaller, had a raised frame that surrounds (and protects) the glass front.  The LG 478500 does not ... there is a single piece of glass that runs all the way to the edge.  The glass just changes to black in color in a thin region around the edge.  It looks more like a painting than a TV.  My wife spontaneously yells out \"that's magnificent!\" and I understood my TV just got more expensive.We bought the TV from amazon with enhanced delivery.  I wasn't there to observe, but my wife said they looked like they had never set up a TV in their life.  At one point they wanted to lay it on it's front, but with the absence of a raised frame, that would most likely scratch the glass.  They did get the TV in it's stand and sitting on the table, but not \"set up\" in any electronic sense.We bought an LG BD590 250GB Blu-Ray player to go with it.  I had read about various incompatibility issues related to various versions of HDMI or different manufacturers' implementations.  Given that the BD590 was among the top reviewed players, it seemed a safe bet.  That's the only source I have tried so far.  At the time of this review, we've watched Avatar and Cars.  I also watched a Hero DVD to check the up-sampling.The picture is stellar.  It looked better in the store than everything else we took the time to compare it to (more detail in the bear's dark fur, more subtle tones on images of snow). Until we get it up on the wall, we're sitting pretty close (about 8') and you can not see a pixel.  I don't have the experience of \"watching TV\" ... it feels more like we are looking through a window.The up-sampled DVD looked great.  It was obviously not as beautiful as the blu-ray disk, but substantially better than my gargantuan Sony Trinitron (the last of the pre-HD monster tube TVs) did with a DVD player.The speakers sound like TV speakers.  With such a beautiful image, I assume that LG assumes that people are going to add their own speakers.Which brings me to my one complaint, but this apparently is a complaint about the industry, not just this TV.  The rest of this review is more about dealing with audio for folks who don't have a home theater setup.This TV has no analog audio output.  Only an optical digital audio output.My setup is simple.  I have  blu-ray player, a TV and an amplifier with speakers.  That's it.  No satellite.  No cable.  No AV receiver.  What I used to do was plug the player into the TV, use the TV volume control with the audio output set on variable, and feed the audio signal to the amplifier from the TV.  It was simple. One volume control did it for all sources.That won't work with this TV.  I called LG customer service (which answered promptly) and they confirmed that only a digital output exists and that, \"all the new TVs are going this way\".  The first comment to this review confirms that.What the industry expects you to do is buy an AV Receiver for a home theater system.  Given that I just want good stereo sound, my problem with AV Receivers is that (a) the TV itself already accepts 10 different inputs and I don't need another box to accept 10 more, (b) it adds another remote control and (c) another volume control and (d) another input select function to watch a simple movie and (e) I'm paying for video up-conversion and other video features I don't need.  My understanding is that the latest HDMI may solve the dual-volume issue.Update: 8/10/2010It's worse than I thought.  From LG customer service:  \"Regretfully, the optical output is a fixed output on this unit, and it will not respond to the television's volume.\".  Thus, it is not possible to connect an external DAC to the optical audio output ... unless you like listening exclusively at full volume.Update: 8/11/2010If you want to use external stereo speakers without buying an A/V Receiver, here are the options that I have found:1)  Almost no-cost solution:Use the headphone jack and run that to your amplifier with a mini plug to RCA adapter cable.  It works, but the quality is about what you would expect ... very compressed sound.  I had to turn the TV volume up to 100% much of the time.2)  Low-cost solution:Use the headphone jack as above, but add a headphone amplifier.  This is the solution I have chosen.  I'm using a Creek OBH-11.  It costs about $200 and is the lowest priced headphone amplifier that audiophiles don't absolutely scoff at.  The Creek has an audio output that you hook into your speaker amplifier and a headphone jack, so you can still use headphones.  This won't improve distortion or frequency response of your sound, but it will improve the dynamics.3) Middle of the road solution:I looked for an HDMI box that might do something similar to an A/V Receiver ... sort of an AV Receiver Lite with a single HDMI input, a pass-through HDMI output, and audio out. Really what I want is an \"Audio Receiver\" to decode HDMI audio without any video.  The closest thing I have found is the Ambrry AU-HDMICP with the very long name of \"HDMI LPCM to Analog Multi-Channel Audio Decoder With Amplifier\".  It's a unique product and it almost does what I want ... but has no volume adjustment.The other option is a Beresford TC-7520.  It's a headphone amplifier with an optical digital input and a manual volume control, and costs about $200.  So ... this works.  You would have to adjust the volume by reaching for the box, which I would prefer not to.  Note one thing ... in the A/V forums this is a controversial product because of the very extreme claims of how fantastic it is and other people saying those claims are a campaign of hype.  For $200, I would not expect a top-end DAC in this product.So, in my opinion, there is no middle of the road solution.  The middle of the road solution is to spend your money on an A/V Receiver and be done with it.4) Audiophile solutionIf you want to put your money into the best audio (stereo) sound and not spend a dime on video switching, you can get the Benchmark DAC1 HDR or Lavry DA11.  They take optical digital input and produce RCA output for your amplifier.  They have nice little remote controls.  The specifications and reviews are impeccable. They are exactly what I want.  Also ... they cost more than the TV.  For $2,000 you could get a decent A/V Preamp, a more audiophile solution than A/V Receiver.  I might have gone down this road except that some A/V forum folks suggested that in a few years, these kind of products will start accepting HDMI and do full, audiophile quality TrueHD decoding.  That would be great.So ... for now ... it looks like if you want to listen to the audio on external speakers, even in stereo, you are pretty much forced to purchase an A/V processor or use the headphone jack.  So be it.Update: 11/30/2010I used the headphone amplifier solution (2) for a few months. It's OK.  But I could only look at those beautiful images so long without screaming inside for better audio.  I broke down and got an Integra 40.1 A/V preamp to go with a three channel B&K; amp that I had. So, after all my bellyaching about the state of the industry, I bought the box I didn't want to buy. The sound is good. I still only use it with stereo plus center channel.  My wife can't figure out all the remotes, so I'll probably also purchase one of those programmable, RF remotes.","Date":"August 5, 2010"}

{"Title":"Much to love and yet much to be disappointed with","Author":"BTX","ReviewID":"R4Y38XJ30FQSO","Overall":"good","Content":"I am writing this after about one week of use.Love:The thinness of this TV is super. Impressive. Admirable.When watching a high quality HD movie or show, such as that transmitted by HBO HD, the quality is stunning. Pleasing. Satisfying. Remarkable. And this is with the TV picture mode set to the standard default.The menus are easy to navigate.Nice that you can stream YouTube.Being able to rotate the TV 20 degrees left and right.Nice looking TV (except for the mirror-like reflection, of course)Happy I was able to get it for $1,800 grand total.Disappointments:While the installation of the base is really easy, the screws are easily stripped. Using a typical screwdriver, the screw heads started showing stripping. Unacceptable. (I didn't strip the screw heads all the way, but there should be no stripping just to install the base on an $1,800 TV.)The speakers. Come on, LG. If Vizio can put in 15 watt speakers, why would you give us 10 watt speakers on an $1,800 TV? The speaker sound is OK for programs like the news, but awful when listening to stations like the Music Choice cable music stations. I tested them with the beautiful instrumental music station and could not turn up the volume very high or else I'd get distortion and/or vibration. This is very upsetting. LG should be ashamed for this. And please don't tell me they expect everyone to connect the TV to an audio amplifier, etc. This is BS. Many people do not want to do this. And isn't $1,800 enough? And again: if other TV companies can offer a flat-screen TV with better sound, LG should be able. I don't have an amp or external speakers, etc. And I don't want to spend any more money. (I am not returning the TV in spite of this speaker complaint. I am just going to live with the disappointment for now. I am just hoping someone at LG will read these complaints and do the right thing in their next TV.)I am disappointed with the quality of the picture when standard def or video via composite RCA cables is transmitted. I know this is to be expected, but I have seen better quality on other sets. If you are still using something like the ReplayTV DVR or VCR where you can only use composite cables, you might be unhappy with the quality of the picture.The remote control does not have a qwerty keyboard. Not a dealbreaker, of course, but Vizio has a qwerty keyboard bluetooth remote with their 47\" LED LCD TV. And their set is $1,400. (And their speakers are better.)The glare of the screen. Highly reflective. If your room lighting is a certain way, you'll certainly get used to it and/or the glare will be less. (With the TV off in a bright room, the screen is a perfect mirror.)Bottom line: I recommend this LG TV if you watch mostly High Def programming, as you will see a gorgeous picture. Nice black levels. Bright and colorful and crystal clear picture that will make you fall in love with watching television. You will never want to go back to a CRT again if this is your first HD experience, of course. (I would give 5 stars for just the picture and the thinness of the TV.) If the best sound quality is important, keep in mind you will need external speakers for that.","Date":"August 17, 2010"}

{"Title":"Amazing Picture, LED local Dimming iffy","Author":"Tallguy1802","ReviewID":"RKQ9S3QTWPQSE","Overall":"good","Content":"OK let me start by saying that this TV looks amazing.  I have mine on the stand it that looks great.  Overall very sleek and stylish.  In a bright room, the glare may be an issue, but if I turned the lights off behind the couch, its fine.  the glare is only an issue in dark scenes.  But thats not the least of worries in dark scenes...The idea of the LED local dimming is excellent.  I bought the TV thinking it was an additional feature, but in normal TV and bright scenes the local dimming works well - especially when there is only a small portion of black and the rest is lighter.  However when you watch a horror movie, for instance - The Strangers, which is very dark with few light portions, the blooming around the lighted spots is ridiculous.  I had to turn the local the dimming off when watching this movie last night.  The response rate is great, but it is definitely noticeable when the LEDs switch on an off as the camera moves.  Also, on very bright screens, like an Apple commercial for example, from certain angles you can see the grid of LEDs lighting up.  There are very subtle darker lines in between the rows of LEDs which is starting to annoy me.  With that said, for almost everything besides extremely bright and extremely dark pictures (with a little bit of light) the picture is outstanding.  I've seen the edge-lit LEDs and definitely notice the blooming on those as well during the same extremely light and dark scenes, so its a matter of personal preference.I would highly recommend this TV, plenty of inputs, awesome picture -just that one annoying issue on extremely light and dark scenes.","Date":"October 21, 2010"}
{"Title":"First large flat panel purchase","Author":"skuter7199","ReviewID":"R30A336TQ8AQ4Y","Overall":"good","Content":"This was my first large flat panel purchase I've made, so I did a bit of research and shopping.  I've only had the tv for just under a week and so far I'm loving it! (Of course, that's easy to say when you replace a 27\" crt tv!)  I only rated the tv at 4 stars because I have not had it long enough to confidently apply 5 stars yet.  The tv arrived in perfect shape.  The first minor issue I had was after assembling the tv stand and setting it in place, I noticed the tv was tilting to the right.  Layed it back down, loosened the screws and was able to shift the stand straight.  I used a tape measure so that I would not have to repeat this process a 3rd time.  Set the tv back in place and it was perfect.  The glare, as many other reviews mention, was a distraction.  The windows directly behind me could still be seen even with a brighter picture on the tv.  I knew this potential going in, so I had a second location already in mind I was able to place the tv with no windows behind me.  Since changing the location, I am very happy with it.  Now, I just need to suck it up and get the HD package from the satellite provider!","Date":"December 8, 2010"}
{"Title":"A good TV, but a TV w/o sound should not be shipped from the factory","Author":"Halfzero","ReviewID":"R2LB6TXADQKUJB","Overall":"good","Content":"When I turned on the 47LE8500 I received, everything worked, except there was no sound from the speakers. After making sure that it was not the setup problem, I concluded that I received a defective unit. I was very upset, thinking about disassembling the stand re-packing the unit, obtaining the RMA, making an arrangement for pickup, and etc. This is a waste of time and money. The unit was shipped from Vanns. I have 14 days to return for a full refund, but I have to pay for shipping it back.Thinking about the hassle of returning the unit, I thought I should open it up and see what I can do. I am an EE, done quite a bit of display designs from CRT to LCD. I know the manufacturing test process on product like this at the factory. It is unusual that a unit w/o sound could have passed without noticed. The unit w/o sound could have caused by intermittent connection that happened to be OK when it was at the factory, but became loose connection after that. With that in mind, I decided to open the back cover and look.From what I saw, the 47LE8500 was very well designed. The main board is where nearly all external connectors are mounted. There are only 2 or 3 board assemblies and minimum wiring. The power supply, the most vunerable module in any electronic appliance, was well designed and thin. The only thing I don't like is that the power supply uses no-name cheap 105C electrolytic capacitors (e-cap). Given the 100,000 hours LED life, these e-caps could fail 10 times or more sooner. Other than that, I am impressed with the design and engineering of this TV.Based on my assumption above, I looked at audio system starting from the speakers . There are 4 of them, 2 for left and 2 for right. I discovered that one of the speaker terminals touched the aluminum chassis. Even though there is a plastic insulator on the terminal, I noticed a burn mark on the aluminum caused by arcing from speaker's terminal. I bent the terminal away from the aluminum chassis and reinstalled the insulator. Before turning it on, I traced the speaker wiring to the audio amplifier located on the main board. The amplifier is a class-D amplifier (NTP-7000)using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique for better efficiency. I felt much better knowing that this kind of amplifier has internal output short circuit protection. The chip should not have been damaged by the short circuit I discovered. I put everything back together, turned it on, and voila...I had sound.OK, here are my comments for all parties involved:Vanns:They did excellent job, TV arrived 3 days after ordering in good shape. They put the original LG box into another box, making it a double packing.LG design Eng:I would take away 1 star for giving a chance of short circuit to happen by design.LG Mfg:I would take away 4 stars for failing to catch this problem. Seeing the black mark, I knew that this problem was intermittent since it was at the factory.The TV itself is of high quality and I love it. For the reflective front glass that many people don't like, I think this is a trade off of having a glass panel vs w/o glass. It is good if you can control light in your room, and could be annoying if you cannot.Update (2/24/11)As many other reviewers pointed out, there is a 0.5mm thick plastic attached to the front glass. I suspect that over 90% of owners do not notice this transparent plastic that covers the entire TV faceplate. It is not obvious for its purpose as it is not explained in the manual. I think it is for protecting the glass before reaching the end user. It seems like you could leave it on forever, but it could be an issue later when it get old, accumulating scratches, and becomes harder to remove. LG Customer Support had no clue, but suggested removing it. It is extremely difficult to reove. It took me 45 minutes to remove it. This is absolutely unacceptable. It is somehow the reflection of how LG works internally as an organization. Some groups are excellent, but some groups are so inferior. In this case, the 47LE8500 is their portrait. I hope that some bigwigs at LG will see my comments here and do something.","Date":"February 2, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great color reproduction, some issues with the back lighting.","Author":"D. Mak \"nedoobie\"","ReviewID":"R10BL4ADFDAS6K","Overall":"good","Content":"Other reviewers have covered the features well. I hope to address areas that I felt weren't focused on by others. I'm happy with this, my first HDTV of this size. For me, this was an upgrade from a 25\" 1080p LCD monitor. My input sources are:Pioneer VSX-1120K AV receiverTiVo Premier XL (service from Comcast HD and ATSC via OTA antenna)XBox 360First I'll speak of the applications embedded with the TV. I find myself surprised at how much I access them. I originally expected to use them sparingly, if at all.Since I've had the LG 47LE8500 setup, I've had two firmware updates, so it's nice to see the manufacturer support the product. If you connect the unit to your network via. the built-in ethernet port, it will automatically check for firmware updates when you access the internet applications. I've not tested this with the optional wireless adapter, which I don't have nor need. Most firmware changes appear to be with the internet applications embedded with the unit: Netflix, VUDU, You Tube, Yahoo Widgets. All the applications work well. At the moment, the only application that supports 1080p with 5.1 Digital audio (via the TOSLINK, for me) is VUDU. I'm not sure if Netflix or YouTube will be updated in the future to support 1080p or 5.1 digital audio in the future. I believe Netflix has introduced a few clients capable of both, but with limited content supporting full HD. The highest supported resolution at the moment appears to be 720p for the LG installed Netflix app. Interestingly, despite having the Netflix and You Tube functionality duplicated on my TiVo Premier, I find it more convenient accessing them directly from the TV's implementation, sacrificing sound quality, just for the convenience of not having to turn on the other devices required to view the same content via. the TiVo. Since I have a TOSLink audio connection from the TV to my receiver, I can get better audio quality from these applications just by turning on the receiver, and muting the TV audio.In my opinion, this is a well designed TV. There are plenty of input and output ports, it runs cool, and most importantly, the display is brilliant. The color reproduction is incredible, from my point of view. I haven't had it calibrated, but a simple image check with some blue lenses and a video calibration video resulted in no tweaks or adjustments required, other than setting the video mode to one of the LG provided configurations: THX/Cinema. The source for this test was the TiVo Premier connected via. HDMI through the Pioneer receiver.The full local dimming feature of the TV makes for some incredible blacks in a fully darkened room. Unfortunately, I have observed a few instances where the back-lighting does bleed through. Possibly related to the full local dimming back-light implementation, I can see a horizontal banding effect apparent when displaying a screen of either white or blue/sky blue. This will probably be most visible watching Ice Hockey or scenes showing a lot of daytime sky. Since the bands appear to be static, I'm guessing it's related to the LED full array local dimming back-light. For me, this is a sufficient trade-off, for the brilliant color reproduction, and deep blacks.Another source I have connected to the TV is a XBox 360 game console. For that input device, I needed a TV with flexibility to disable whatever display processing that might introduce input lag. I'm happy with this unit in that it has not appeared to introduce any discernible input lag when I disable the TruMotion or any video upscaling options on both the TV and AV receiver. I have noticed some audio/video sync issues with some television programs from the TiVo input source when I was playing with the TruMotion adjustment options in conjunction with the video processing features available on my receiver, but that's to be expected.I'm very happy with the LG 47LE8500. I had very specific requirements going into my purchase. I researched my options extensively and came to the conclusion this TV met my requirements best, and I'm happy with that.","Date":"November 19, 2010"}

{"Title":"Love this TV","Author":"Mike In Kennesaw","ReviewID":"RZVCGQP4E2GNX","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV from Amazon and it actually shipped from Vanns. I had been patiently waiting for the right TV at the right price to upgrade from my 5/6 year old Samsung 720p, 60 Hz DLP TV. (Lots of acronyms there) When Amazon/Vanns dropped the price of this 1080p/240Hz TV under $1,300, I knew the time was right. The shopping experience with Amazon and Vanns was superb. It arrived on time. It was heavier than expected, but the FedEx guy helped me bring it in the house and I gave him a tip for his extra effort. Set up was a breeze for me. It replaced a 50\" DLP, so it is just a bit smaller. The TV has a plastic cover over the glass screen. I tried to get it off, but I think that it had been super glued in place. I called LG to make sure that it was supposed to come off as the manual never mentioned removing it. The lady told me it comes off easy. Well, easy must be a relative term because I could not get it off. I just set it up with the plastic in place. About a week later, a friend's son dropped by and said he thought he could get the plastic off. We took the TV down and placed it on cushions on the floor. He and I both were finally able to get the plastic off after about 30 minutes and a lot of sweat and muscle. I think pulling teeth may have been easier. However, once we reattached the TV without the plastic, I could not believe the picture quality. It was amazing!!!The only audio out is digital optical so I never hooked that up since my TV is about 20 feet from the surround sound system. I play audio through a surround sound system with Klipsch speakers anyway, so who needs the TV sound. However, I did buy a couple of optical audio cables to connect from my Dish receiver and Blu-Ray player to my sound system. I am now seeing and hearing Dish content and Blu-Ray movies like never before. And the Super Bowl was incredible, commercials too!!! The picture is so clear that I never realized how much make-up news casters and TV/movie stars wear.I absolutely love the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It was the first movie I watched in Blu-Ray on this amazing TV with the digital optical audio. It was like I had never seen these movies before!!I am one happy camper, although I probably should have gone to the zoo to get a Gorilla to remove that plastic cover. I highly recommend this TV as long as you can remove the cover. I would buy another one if I had a place to put it and could get my friend's son to peel the plastic off!!","Date":"February 10, 2011"}

This pretty much gives you what most reviews have said about this.  The picture quality is amazing, the controls are easy, and the swivel base is very useful for connecting things behind the TV.  The bad piece is that the TV is extremely reflective. You will want to watch your darker movies at night with the lights turned off.  Another bad piece is that LG supplies really poor screws for the base.  I had read enough about this that I was very careful putting it together, but the screws strip very easily.  Also, just FYI, this TV is much heavier than its 47inch LG counterparts.

This is not a big problem for me but I do have one major complaint about the design.  The panel is thin and would normally look great on a wall but most of the inputs face to the rear.  Wall mounting makes these inputs useless unless you create a fairly deep cavity in the wall to allow plugs to be connected.  It would have made far more sense to face most of the inputs to the side or preferably down to make wall mounting more practical.","Date":"December 14, 2010"}

I have noticed that less expensive LCD TV's don't have this reflection, check out the plasma TV's.  I like the Samsungs but the shadow detail just wasn't there, you adjust and it made everything else lighter.  The LG has plenty of fixed picture selections which I liked because I want to buy a TV and turn it on and watch it and not have to worry about spending another couple hundred dollars to calibrate it, what a scam 'BEST BUY'.  One thing to look out for the new LG LX9500 just has the 3-D feature and is not worth the huge price increase, it's the same TV as the LG LE8500.  The TV is very heavy so be careful and have someone help you hang it or just getting it out of the box.  The sound sucks like all 10 watt LED TV's do, buy a sound bar they come in so many sizes now. Compare the specs you are getting a lot of TV with this LG and if your worried about quality just buy the extended LG service plan.","Date":"November 24, 2010"}

The design of this thing is great. Slim and monolithic. The single sheet of glass design is awesome. It does produce some glare, although not horrible. The worst part about this TV is the speakers. They are just not up to snuff but then again there are few TV's that are. A simple sound bar solved this problem (SONY HTC-150). Love the streaming netflix. The image quality is amazing.

Long story short everything I read pointed me to this unit.  I then checked the unit and setup at many locations until I finally pulled the trigger.  The main concern I had prior to purchasing this unit was the glare that I observed as well as is documented in other product reviews on this unit.  This is a result of the solid glass panel which covers the entire screen.  In a room where light can be controlled, such as my office this is a non issue.  However if you have a bright room (lots of windows) DO NOT BUY THIS TV unless you want to watch only at night.  If, on the other hand, there is not much ambient light entering your room this TV will reward you with the best picture quality and fps of any TV in its class.  The knock I have on it which is not worth of a star deduction is that it does not have built in Wifi o be ready to purchase a LG USB dongle for between $30-$70.  I was so satisfied with this TV's performance that I bought one as a Christmas gift for my folks.  Be advised this panel is not 3D (which I believe to a be a gimmick for rubes) and only goes up in size to 55\".  It took it out of the running for my replacement  as my main home theater screen as I wanted a 65\" or above LED or Plasma.","Date":"September 1, 2011"}
{"Title":"THIS TV IS FABULOUS","Author":"L. Fenner","ReviewID":"RFLSSJL20NV5L","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a LOT of research on HD LED TV's before purchasing this one right after Christmas.  It had great professional critic reviews as well as good customer reviews. It was an excellent choice for us and we love it. It was easy to set up and easy to perfect your personal preferences with the quality of the picture and audio. I did purchase a soundbar for the audio and it's great. The screen on this one is glass so if you have a very bright room, you may want to consider purchasing one with a matte finish, because it is reflective. We only have lamps in our living room for lighting so it works very well for us. If you have a lot of windows that face the screen, then I wouldn't recommend this one. Other than that, this TV has excellent picture quality. I also purchased the LG usb dongle for a wireless  internet connection and it was simple to set up and use. Took just a few minutes. Now we watch all the Netflix movies we want. My husband is in love with it.It's now 1/31/2013 and we STILL absolutely love our TV.","Date":"June 8, 2011"}

I set it up with no help which is no small feat as I'm not the handiest person.  The picture was perfect after some basic tuning with the picture wizard included in the set.  I reduced the red and blue saturation a bit and changed some other settings to ones I found suggested on CNET.  The quality is so good it's like looking through a window at the real thing.  I didn't have any problem at all removing the plastic film as noted by other reviewers.  We've hardly noticed any glare from the glass panel but I can say the depth of the picture is phenomenal, hence the reason they did the glass panel.  With 4 HDMI and 2 USB inputs it eliminated the hassle of daisy chaining peripherals together.  The remote has some cool features that bring this set into the 21st century such as Widgets that let you go to YouTube or get a local weather forecast at the touch of a button.  I can't report any cons to this set now that the price has dropped.

{"Title":"Amazing HD picture","Author":"Sean M. Kirkpatrick \"Sean Kirkpatrick\"","ReviewID":"RSYAX8G600XQU","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is mounted in a secondary viewing area on a full motion arm purchased from monoprice (ID 4926).  The picture is amazing.  Deep blacks and crisp colors.  My primary TV is the Sony KDS-R70XBR and the picture on this LG is definitely better.  The transaction with OneCall through Amazon was issue-free.  The TV was very carefully secured and shipped from WA to NJ without tripping the shockwatch device attached to the box.  I was a bit nervous about making this expensive a purchase for this fragile an item online, but was immediately more comfortable when OneCall followed up immediately to keep me informed regarding how the TV would be handled from the point of purchase to delivery.I also purchased the wireless 802.11n usb adapter and once switched over to use the wireless device (WPA2), the TV was immediately connected.  Netflix, Vudu, and CinemaNOW are all working great (though I tend to not rent from the latter two).All that said, the TV has its shortcomings.  I don't understand what the TruMotion functionality is actually doing.  I had to turn it off because the images appear to be jittery and almost accelerated when it is on.  I was expecting access to Pandora via the LG Netcast functionality, but that is not available to me.  It may be that it isn't available in NJ, but I felt this was misrepresented in the advertising and was disappointed with this since I am an annual subscriber to Pandora One.The biggest disappointment was the lack of capabilities around the built in DLNA media streaming.  The TV is also heavily advertised as being DLNA certified.  I have a media server configured that I had been accessing via my PS3 using PS3 Media Server.  Most of my home library is stored as .ts containers of h264 encoded HD movies with PCM audio streams (since the PS3 seemed to deal with this combo the best).  The DLNA usage was a bit of a gamble on my part, admittedly, because even many of the review sites mention that LG claims that it is possible but that it was not part of the review (cnet).  I converted a few of my DVDs to MKVs and these will play, but I'm still having issues with the aspect ratio.  The movie that I'm testing with is definitely widescreen, but is displayed as 4:3 full screen (squished) on the TV no matter what.  From my own tinkering so far, it supports low resolution streams ok, but can't handle HD streams.  For a TV that's really made for displaying HD video, this is a bit of a let down.  I still haven't given up and am trying to work out alternative methods to do this, but there is very little to no information regarding the TV as a renderer.As a TV, the picture is phenomenal when connected to an HD source or streaming HD content from Netflix.  The lack of Pandora and the DLNA streaming issues that I'm having are the reasons to dock the review 1 star.","Date":"January 9, 2011"}

{"Title":"Just what I was looking for","Author":"TomT223","ReviewID":"R6GTESMRO9TLQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I had been shopping for a new HDTV for several months. So many choices but I definitely wanted something that would stream the internet and had a few other specific functions. This particular model had everything I was looking for. One thing I did not want and have no desire to ever have is a 3D TV so this model also was attractive because of that. It had come down to just a handful of choices and when this TV came up for $1350 with free shipping and no taxes I jumped on it and I could not be more happy with my purchase. Of course it will probably get even cheaper in the future but isn't that the same with all electronics?It helps if you research the proper settings for this TV to get a good picture because the default settings are okay but far from perfect. Once you get it set just right the picture is absolutely phenomenal.The reviews about the glare kind of spooked me but I don't find it that bad at all. Yes I had to adjust a couple of lamps in my living room to eliminate some glare but that was easily accomplished. The glass makes this a really attractive TV that's easy to clean and care for.I'm old school and I also have an analog stereo that I paid huge amounts of money for in the 80's and refuse to let go of so I had to get an audio adapter since it has no rca cable plugs. Here's a secret for those in the same predicament: There's a website called monoprice.com that you can find everything you need under $30 to accomplish this and it sounds great. The TV's own built in sound is not really that bad either, at least compared to my previous TV's.I really love the ability to watch Netflix movies and access my Picassa photo account through this set. If you don't plan on connecting your TV to the internet then you are wasting your money for this set because that's a key feature. Plus the ability to download updated firmware is fantastic.About the only complaint I have is it's kind of difficult to get to the usb ports in the rear. But that's minor and a short usb extension cable should solve that problem.","Date":"December 6, 2010"}

It does require two-people though (I did it by myself, but a second person would've helped dramatically).The picture is very crisp and clean out-the-box. I recommend doing the picture wizard feature to get the brightness and color correct. The glare on this tv is pretty noticible but as long as you face it away from windows or direct light, you should be okay.I mostly play First-Person-Shooters on this led-tv and watch blu rays. It is very fast and responsive. Virtually no blur or judder. DVD's look great when up-scaled as well. I haven't used the online services that it offers since my PS3 already offers them.Cons:The price. I paid $1199 brand-new at Fry's Electronics in So-cal on 12/04/10 (but I've heard that people have spent way more then that)The \"blooming effect\" on the local dimming feature.

{"Title":"Amazing LCD for cinema!","Author":"Jason","ReviewID":"R15SC2EXC64DQZ","Overall":"good","Content":"While some complain about reflections being an issue, I have found that as long as I keep any sources of glare directly off the screen (particularly directly behind your seating position), glare is hardly an issue. Off axis viewing is superb, as well as color accuracy and contrast. I DO highly suggest you get your set professionally calibrated for the best viewing experience. (This model supports the highest level of calibration possible unlike most consumer grade LCD sets.)For use in a dimmed home theater setting, I have seen few sets that can equal the quality of the image. (with the exception of extremely high-end plasma displays costing many times the cost of this).The swivel base is both nice looking (glass covered) and proves to be handy when making connections on the back or for different seating arrangements. Wall mounting is handy, but be sure you use screws included with the set to attach the wall mount brackets. The depth of other screws could be too long and damage the internals if you are not careful.Drawbacks are the fact that due to the thin profile of the set, the sound from the built-in speakers is anemic but does play loud enough for general viewing. I highly suggest a proper home theater system for viewing movies, etc.A second \"drawback\" for some would be the fact that the set is quite heavy because the face is solid glass and the rear is metal (not plastic). Personally, I find this to prove the quality of the set inside and out, but it can be difficult to lift/move for many people. And you will want to go with a wall mount that can support the extra weight if you go that route. I have used a heavy duty double arm cantilever mount with no issues with the set for almost a year before using the included stand. Just be sure both the mount is capable of the weight AND the attachments to the wall are STRONG and very secure!","Date":"March 2, 2012"}
{"Title":"A very good TV","Author":"Jon in the Southwest \"Jon\"","ReviewID":"R1SB9Q6O6KIQQD","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this TV online from Vann's in November of 2010 and we have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since. It replaced a 2002 Sony CRT Trinitron for the living room. WOW, and what a differnce it has made! LG apparently does not make it anymore, but I am going to upgrade the software today from their website to see if they have added more apps and perhaps some other types of functionalities that I an unaware of.  As far as the screen and the reflectiveness, it is a reflective screen that can glare, but we have it in a place that is not too bright. This does bring up one point though, and this is that when using the Eco mode to reduce screen brightness and to use less power, the screen gets too dark for my taste. As I said, it is placed in a darker spot of the living room and I would not expect the Eco mode to therefore make the screen as dark as it does, but it could just be my middle aged eyesight not being what it one was; cataract formation perhaps...  Whatever the case, it is a great TV with so many functions and inputs/outputs. I can overlook the issue of the Eco mode being too dark for my eyesight. One output that we just began to use is the optical output to our new Yamaha sound bar. Since November of 2010 we have just used the built-in 5.1 speakers and they have done the job, but now with a soundbar connected thru the optical output I would find it hard to go back to just using the built-in speakers. Of course money is limited, so having watched this TV without a soundbar for over a year now I have no complaints about sound quality; in addition to this, the picture at 240Hz refresh is perfect for sports and set to standard brightness it is a pleasure to view sports games with! Not a single issue of blur for  fast paced sporting events.  I saw that someone complained about this TV only doing \"military\" time. What a crock. Most of the world uses a 24 hour time cycle because it is logical and easier. Having lived in Europe as a civilian, it is personally my preferred method of time recording. One does not need be a rocket scientist in order to add 6 hours onto 12 noon in one's head and say that it is 18:00.  Having praised this TV I must add that since technology changes so fast I would look around at the newer models before I would buy this one at 2 grand or even at 1400 bucks (which is what we paid for it, when it was on special from Vann's). There is a great deal of competition and  LED TV models are constantly being updated and/or renamed. This is a very good TV, but look at the newer LG models and other brands as well. Perhaps the side-lit LED models are better when placed in bright spot? Perhaps other models have better Eco modes? Do the research online, go to the stores to check out things and then make a decision.","Date":"February 3, 2012"}

I was not sold on 3D TVs and knew I wanted the LED for not only the picture quality, but also for the slim design. I've owned this TV for roughly 9 months now and I have no doubts whatsoever. Many people complain about the glare/reflection. My TV is currently sitting on a base stand that has a window facing it. While there is a glare/reflection, this is not a big deal, for me at least. With blinds closed its a non factor. Please note, there is a plastic film that coats the TV screen. I noticed this and thought that maybe it should be removed.

It allows you to have the TV almost flat against the wall or you can pull it out roughly 8-10 inch. to get at the hook ups. You can also swing the TV left or right and tilt it up or down. Angling the TV down a little helps with the glare. Sorry for the review on the wall mount, but if you are concerned with glare, this is the way to go.

{"Title":"A Great LED LCD TV for the Price","Author":"Phunphil","ReviewID":"R3380NA72UYQDN","Overall":"good","Content":"Note: This review is written for middle-of-the-road folks who just want to know if this is a good TV or not, and don't want to get into the nitty-gritty about constrast ratios, refresh rates, etc. (like me!).Summary: If you're looking for a reasonably priced, full LED LCD TV that throws in a few extra bells and whistles, you cannot go wrong with LG's INFINIA LE8500 series.Pros: This TV has a great picture. The full LED display provides excellent picture clarity, and I would argue that this set rivals some plasmas for the black levels it can produce. In a nutshell, the LE8500 produces the kind of image quality that you would expect from a new 1080p LCD TV (and then some).I have not had a chance to use the NetCast features on this TV (more on that later), but I'm looking forward to being able to access features such as Netflix, Vudu, and the Yahoo \"widgets\" that allow you to read news, sports updates, etc. without having to leave whatever show you're watching. Last I checked, however, NetCast doesn't include Hulu, which I'd rather have than Facebook or Youtube.I also really appreciate the functionality of this TV. The menu system is easy to navigate, providing clear symbols for the various inputs you might have plugged in and uncluttered menu screens. I also appreciate the fact that LG throws in two remotes; one for doing everything and one for folks who just want to \"change the channel or volume\".Also, though it's not important in the grand scheme of things, the aesthetic of this TV is really nice. It's slim design and glass finish give it a classy, unobtrusive look. I also haven't had any glare issues with this TV like other folks have, and I have my TV set up next to a large window.Cons: The biggest issue I have with this TV is its TruMotion (the feature that makes whatever you're watching look like a soap opera--good for sports or other \"live\" programming); I just don't see a big difference, even with it set to high. The sound quality is also pretty standard, though this isn't uncommon for most flat screen TVs.  Finally, I was also disappointed to find out that a separate dongle had to be purchased in order to wirelessly connect to the internet. Though in fairness, this is more the fault of the Frys salesman that we bought this TV from than LG's--he told us a separate dongle wasn't required.In closing, I've always been a Sony or Samsung guy when it came to my electronics and TVs, but LG has surprised me with this affordable and versatile TV. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.","Date":"January 14, 2011"}
{"Title":"Nice Television","Author":"Jason Dragon","ReviewID":"R3IBYYKS3TMSXN","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for 1 day now and so far I'm satisfied. The picture quality does seem much better than my old Sony projection TV. The audio with the built in speakers is a step down, but that I probably expected given the trend towards thinner and thinner TVs. After hooking up and turning on the TV my wired network was automatically recognized and 2 software updates occurred. The built in Netflix streaming app presented a very nice picture and has more features than the same app in my LG BD390 Blu-Ray player. A cable TV signal and a Blu-Ray movie both displayed nicely as well.I find this TV to have much less glare than my old projection TV. There is a film on the glass that goes to within a few millimetes of each edge.  On top of that in the lower left corner was a 4 x 9 inch sticker advertising the TV's features - which obviously is meant to be removed. But it was a bit confusing to me whether the film was meant to be removed along with it. The edge of the sticker was close to the edge of the film. The film was thick enough to make it seem like it was just meant for protection during shipping, but it was perfectly straight and blemish free. I contacted customer support and they said \"Please do not remove this film. That is a protective film for the panel of the TV. It is part of the design of the unit.\" The film does seem to also have an anti-glare property to it.","Date":"January 7, 2011"}

If you want it, better find another set as this set does not have that feature.I would love if the LG Netcast service had a option to check Facebook...what can I say, I'm hooked.  ;-)Setting this TV up was a snap.  I took it out of the package, plugged in the cable and ethernet, set my time zone, and that's all you have to do.  It's a snap.  The picture is great, although I did change the \"picture mode\" to \"vivid\" as I liked the way that looked.  Anyway, I'm happy with the purchase.  FWIW, We bought both the 47 and 55 inch sets.My only gripe, is that I wish that they had included a single, more richly featured, programmable remote control.  They give you two remotes, a mini remote that does just the basics, and a full remote.  I would love to be able to add my Tivo and cable features to their remote.","Date":"December 24, 2010"}

{"Title":"Great TV, shipping problem, reflective screen an issue","Author":"Leading Edge Boomer","ReviewID":"R1P14SAZZJ6SU3","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this to replace an early-adopter Sharp LCD (when the monitor was separate from another electronics box) that was six years old, with the goal to get far better video.  This has been achieved, and I sold the old one to someone who will use it as a 45\" gaming monitor--he may be disappointed with the response times.  I've had this product for a few days now, so here's a review of the process and the product.1.  Delivery: quite fast, I'm in NM, it was shipped from Phoenix, so I had hopes it would endure minimal handling.2.  Delivery condition:  bad.  The manufacturer's box was the shipping container, and it arrived via UPS with a long gash in the box, noted by the UPS guy.  The styrofoam packing pieces were also somewhat broken.  Turns out (by chance) that it was the backside of the product, but something got far in to make a little dent in the metal.  So I was anxious to get the product set up to see that it functioned correctly--OK.  A problem for LG:  When the two straps are removed, the top is lifted from the base of the package, but the bottom packaging is insufficient to hold the unit upright--be prepared to lean it on something.  Better, don't start unpacking before moving the box to very near to the product destination.The product is heavy--70 lb with stand, and requires two able people to handle.  I have a broken foot, but we were able to get'er done.I have bought LCD TVs via the Internet twice before.  They both came with a shipping box encasing the manufacturer's product enclosure, and this one did not.  AMAZON, ARE YOU READING THIS?  The manufacturer's box works when wrapped up on a pallet with others, and when taken home by a buyer from a bricks-and-mortar store.  IT IS NOT AN INDIVIDUAL SHIPPING BOX!3.  Performance:  excellent.  As delivered, even home mode was in carnival colors.  You can search online among \"expert\" reviews to find what they take as optimum adjustments, and modify as desired.  To me, it's completely realistic after that.I don't use the TV audio, so I cannot comment on that.4.  Reflective screen:  definitely an issue.  Daytime, our sliding-door blinds are not black-out, and viewing from my computer desk is a problem.  At night, we have to dim lamps or use others to completely eliminate distraction.  Evaluate this for your own setting, since your mileage may vary.There is nothing in the manual about removing what some have found as a plastic cover on the glass; apparently it is not to be removed.  Cleaning with their cloth has instructions to spritz the cloth with a little water, and use nothing else since, unlike computer monitors, the LCD is not exposed.I'll update this if anything happens.","Date":"July 2, 2011"}

So after contacting LG customer service they told me now another technician has to come and look at it!! so we scheduled another service. the new technician came and confirmed the problem (for each appointment I had to take time off work). So when I call back they tell me that the technician needs to come back one more time!!! At that point I gave up and just returned the TV.","Date":"December 20, 2010"}
{"Title":"Extremely reflective, Timer issues, Ghosting, Bad Cust service.","Author":"Garan Grey \"Garan Grey\"","ReviewID":"R3HN01ZP7U4YU4","Overall":"good","Content":"Got this in Dec 2010.  The screen is ridiculously reflective.  Powersaver/Autoadjust feature produces bad images, Local Dimming isn't very effective because the LED blocks are huge and any white letters on a black background will have at least 2 inches square ghostly glow around them bright enough to see across the room.  Replacing a 14 year old TV that had 2 timers, this has only one, The clock loses at least two minutes a week, and when you set the timer to turn it on, it turns itself off 2hrs after, even when you do not set an off time.  Did I mention the clock will only show military time?  Who are they making these things for?  Customer service is awful.  They won't send anyone out on weekends, so you would have to take a day off work, and the one kid they DID send (an actual LG rep) knew less about the TV and how it worked than I do.

{"Title":"Great set, but not perfect","Author":"David G. Beneke","ReviewID":"R24ORPUDHKFC13","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture quality of my LG 47LE8500 is outstanding, sharp picture, deep blacks, accurate colors. There is an infinite number of ways to adjust the picture in the expert modes, so you can make the picture look even more stunning. When shopping for a set, this one stood out above all the others in several retail stores I went to, in regards of picture quality and color accuracy. It certainly beat out the Sharp Quattron series, which is the 4 led technology, in regards to color and picture quality. A word of warning to those who purchase this set, DO NOT TAKE THE PLASTIC SHEET OFF OF THE FRONT OF THE SET!!! LG should have made a note of this fact, because I, like many others who have reviewed this set, made the mistake of doing that, thinking it was a shipping protection cover. Nope, LG says it is necessary for getting a better picture, although the phone tech could not say why. In any case,with mine removed, I have not noticed any difference in picture quality, the screen is highly reflective, with or without the sheet. Taking the sheet off WILL void certain warranty issues.I'll cut to the chase and tell you first what I don't like about the set, as in other reviews on this site (amateur and professional) and in forums, there is the issue of noticeable horizontal banding when the picture is very bright, such as sky, solid color animation (the \"Rhapsody in Blue\" sequence in the Blu-ray of \"Fantasia 2000\" is a great example) or light scenes. To a hard core purest, it could be very annoying, but the majority of the time you will not see it. The next issue is screen glare. I have my LG recessed in a cabinet and a dark viewing room so this is not a big issue with me. However, you will see reflections if you have windows, lamps and so forth in your viewing area, much like a CRT screen. The THX bright room setting will help with most of a rooms glare artifacts, and you can boost the backlight and brightness and contrast, however this will make the horizontal banding more apparent.No set is perfect, and the pluses, out weigh the minuses of this model. The picture is second to none in any category, the infinite number of adjustments and inputs will please the tweakers, like myself, and having worked in broadcasting and motion pictures for 35 years now, I find this set to be the most cinematic I have ever seen, in fact a Blu-ray on this set looks better than any movie screen, period! HD broadcasts stunning, Dodger baseball in HD is like being there. Also this set is very net friendly, assuring that it won't go out of date any time soon, and increases it's versatility. The sound on the set is okay, the true voice technology is good for getting dialog from a noisy source, but I rarely use it, as I have a very nice 5.1 sound system set up. The infinite sound set up does give you a sense of surround sound, but it is not as dynamic as a separate sound system, one shouldn't expect that anyway.I have contacted LG customer service regarding the banding issue, they are sending a tech to my home to hopefully address the issue. If this problem is taken care of, I will write an addendum to this review and bump the rating from 4 to 5 stars, which it will truly deserve.Addendum to review 4-26-2011LG repair came over to my house, saw the banding problem, and ordered a new back panel. A week later, the same LG tech came back, very carefully, and I can not praise him enough for the great care he took to pad furniture, equipment and so on. He installed a new back panel, and the banding is gone! LG is aware of the problem, so if you are bothered by this on your unit, have LG install a new panel. The picture is absolutely outstanding. The only issue is because of the glass front there is a lot of glare. My viewing room is very dark so this is not a problem for me, and if the back lighting and contrast are bumped up, as it is in THX Bright Room mode, I don't think glare will be an issue. Love this set and can not praise its picture enough.","Date":"April 22, 2011"}

When i received this product and it did not include any stand for the TV. I was forced to call amazon to help reorder the stand for the tv. Amazon has great customer service, they called for me, but LG asked that I called, which i did. Even though LG is a great electronic company, the employees are nice but the wait was too long. It took about 2-3 weeks for the TV to arrive at our house and another 3 weeks to wait for the stand which was not rushed at all. It took almost a month for us to finally be able to set up the tv.

{"Title":"A Value Buy","Author":"Fanliao","ReviewID":"R1WX46HPUWZSEZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Since money has never been a little more than scarcity for me and I do not want to necessarily living in a compromised way, I am a die hard value buyer in every category. When it comes to time to buy our next TV, there is no difference in my online buying methods. First I 'glanced' at the specifications - i know LED is next thing up from LCD or Plasma, so LED it is; I know 1080i is better resolution than 720i, so 1080i it is; if internet streaming movies is a possible then I do not have to wait for my movie to come at the mail box, then internet application TV it is. And we already know that we want a TV that is 42\" to 48\" in size.Once we kind of know what we want, then we compare the customer reviews and pricing of the suitable candidates. We've looked at Sony, Panasonic, Samsung and LG, and pretty quickly we realize that the LG Infinity has all the feathers that we want, but about at least $400-$500 less than the bigger brands, and the previous more than 100 reviews do not reflect anything that is alarming. Since we have had a LG plasma for the past 7 years, so we have already trusted the brand. So we decided to give it a try.Up to today we have had the unit for more than 3 weeks now, and I am happy to say it is indeed a \"value buy\" that we were looking for and we are quite happy with the purchase.Picture quality - my husband's rating is 'very good' and my rating is 'good'. Since I generally have a little bit more sharper eyes than my husband because of my photography training, I can notice some tiny pixelation in National Geographic Channel when the scenes are rapidly changing, that is when you look really closely. Other than that, all the other High Def channels look very sharp and vivid. (I recommend to simply check CNN high def channel and National Geographic Channel for your High Def TV - if your CNN does not even look good to you, then all of your other high def channels will not possibly look good; and if your National Geographic Channel looks superb, then you can be assured you've got a great high def TV)Sound - as other reviewers already pointed out, you will likely to be disappointed if you intend to use the audio that is directly out of the TV set. We already expected this and we do have a AV system to go with it, so this is not a problem for us.Internet Application - this is a tricky part at first. It wasn't very clear how to connect to internet until you read the manual and figured out that a specific LG AN-WF100 Wi-Fi USB Adaptor is necessary to make it work wirelessly. Once the adaptor is ordered and used, it takes forever to find the home network and then it takes forever to set it up (it took me more than 30 minutes to figure out how to enter the WEB Key by using the remote control). When it was finally done, the downloading from Nextlix still seemed slow and from time to time it would lost the communication with the home network and we would have to start over again. Our TV is about 35 feet from the router and the wireless path includes about 3 walls, so we naturally presume that the 35 feet wireless distance is too much for wireless downloading. It is not! After we also purchased a Sony Blue Ray DVD with Wi-fi built in, I tested by using the Sony Blue Ray DVD to wireless connect the internet and downloading, boy it was a breeze! It turns out, the Sony Blue Ray DVD has no problem connecting our home network and the downloading was super fast! So the verdict is in - the LG LED unit is internet 'not so ready'! LG needs to improve a lot more on the software part to catch up with Sony!A last word about the the reflective glass panel that many customer mentioned as a problem that bothered them - it does not bother us at all! We think that the glass panel looks very very nice! It is a full piece of thick smooth glass with a black frame and thin outer transparent edge. Yes it is reflective, but the reflection is smooth and the overall look of the unit is very high end, much better than the LG Plasma we had before. The aesthetic look of the unit is a pleasant surprise for both myself and my husband!In my book, if you can save 30 - 35% to get 90% what you want, then it is a good value buy. As a matter of fact, the money we saved ($400 - $500) more than covered for our new Sony Blue Ray DVD player with Wifi build in (we paid $189 plus tax at Best Buy). So overall it is a satisfactory value buy for us!","Date":"January 23, 2011"}
{"Title":"LG Selling Defective Merchandise - Brand New TV Completely Unusable","Author":"Jeffrey J Freeman","ReviewID":"R3MCRQ4SJRQ92B","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this television because of positive reviews and a gorgeous picture. But now this television is virtually unusable because of defective screws that are supposed to attach the television to the base.I began assembling the television, and the screwdriver I used immediately began to augur out the screw heads, stripping them out and rendering them completely unusable. So now I have a half-assembled television that won't stand upright, and I can't even use it on a wall mount because the screw heads are too stripped out to get the screws out.Even worse was the customer service line. They accused me of breaking the television and told me I would have to pay $75 for a tech visit. I told them that the screws were obviously defective (a sound argument given that this was the first time I was using them, and I was using a properly-sized phillips-head screwdriver to drive in the phillips-head screws), and he told me that the technician would make that determination. To make matters worse, he could not schedule a technician at that time, and told me that LG would call me back to schedule an appointment. It is over 24 hours later and I still do not have an appointment.A word to anybody considering puchasing this or any other LG TV - save yourself a heap of frustration and don't buy from LG. They sell a defective product that they do not stand behind. I guess it's easier for LG to  blame consumers for LG's own faulty parts instead of taking accountability for their shoddy, defective product.","Date":"August 2, 2010"}
{"Title":"Good TV, but a few things you should know ...","Author":"WorknMan \"worknman\"","ReviewID":"R26ZOSWFLGGFM9","Overall":"good","Content":"Just a few things you should know before buying this TV, or any rear projection HDTV in general:1. If you live nearby a brick and mortar store that carries this TV, see if they will let you hook a DVD player up to it, and then get the TV out of 'torch mode' by lowering the brightness and contrast (easily done via the remote) to about 50 - this will give you a much better idea of how it will look in your home. Also, when you get the TV home, bringing it out of torch mode is the first thing you should do, as leaving these settings cranked up to the max could damage your TV. If you see this thing on display in a store, they usually have it connected to an HD signal running at 1080i, the best resolution possible. Movies on DVD will not look *quite* that good.2. These TVs don't exactly come ready to watch, as they require a little tweaking, especially this TV, as it tends to have a 'red push' that you'll need to get rid of. Doing this is not exactly brain surgery, and the Avia Home Theater guide (also available on Amamzon) is a big help, but you should at least be aware of this.3. Burn-in: While not as bad as Plasma TVs when it comes to image burn-in, you must be consciously aware (but not paranoid) about the possibility of burn-in with this set. If you're the type of person who likes to play video games (which usually display a lot of static images, such as health meters), for hours on end, you may want to go with an LCD or DLP rear projection TV, if you can afford one :) Otherwise, a direct view (conventional) CRT HDTV may be better for you.4. If you plan to use a component video cable for DVD playback, some people will say that the kind of cable you use doesn't matter. While the kind of cable you use does not matter on other TVs, it DEFINITELY matters on this one. From my experience, there was a HUGE difference in picture quality between a set of $30 Acoustic Research cables and a $100 set of Monster Ultra THX cables. After trying the Monster cables, I ordered a set of component cables from [...] which are about as good as the Monster cables for a much lower price. Even if you elect to start out with a cheap cable, you should look into upgrading the cable if you notice the picture quality is not as it should be.5. There is no HDTV tuner built into this set, which means you'll either have to buy the tuner seperate ($200+) or get one from your cable or satellite company, which will usually provide one for you. You don't need a tuner simply for watching DVDs though.6. About the look of the TV - previous reviewer said it doesn't look like the one in the picture. Actually, it looks very close, except Amazon shows the TV sitting on its optional stand - the bottom part of the TV is actually one piece, not two. If you want to see what it really looks like, search for the model number on [...]7. In regards to what the previous reviewer says about room size, since I have the TV in a small room, I don't think the size of the room matters, just as long as you're setting at least 6-8 feet from the set.8. For more information about these topics and more, check out [...]Hopefully, I didn't scare you away with all of this info, because this is probably the best 46\" CRT rear projection HDTV you'll find in this price range - I highly recommend it!","Date":"November 24, 2004"}

A first time, budget-minded HDTV buyer.  I researched many units, and decided to go with this one because it was on sale for $999.Picture with HD: With HD (through Comcast) it is awesome. My friend has a TV that he spent $4000 on, and he says that he can't notice a difference in picture crispness.Picture without HD: It is at least as good as what I had on my 27\" TV prior to this.  It ain't crisp, but it is very acceptable for a TV this large.I do notice some \"artifacts\" on this TV. If you are looking at this level of unit to buy, you probably don't even know what that means.  I didn't!  It means that you see some \"streaking\" of white on fast moving images.  It happens so rarely, though, that you won't notice much.The TV has some great stretch settings, too.  I was worried that any signal coming in at 4:3 would look distroted when I stretch it to 16:9, but this unit has a setting that only stretches the top and bottom, removing letterboxes but not distorting the main pic.  It also has one that stretches left and right, making 4:3 fill the screen without distrotion.The sound is better than the sound from my 27\" unit.  It is all I need for my small room, until I get a surround system.Inputs:  It does have an HDMI input. I'm told that is the top of the line input. I run my cable and DVD via the component inputs for ultra clear pic.In short, get this TV. For the price, I have absolutely no regrets!","Date":"December 7, 2004"}

In the manual is staets a few time that you should watch programs sing the entire screen, no bars on the top and botton (widescreen dvds sometimes cause that) or bars on the right and left or the \"natural\" settings. OK, I'm fine with that now that I know, might have been nice if the sales guy mentione dthis to me :(Any how, when you turn on your set it always defaults to the natural setting. I have an HD digital cable box and it only uses the \"whole\" screen on the HD channels. So if Toshiba knows about this problem why not have the TV default to full screen? It's a bit of a pain to turn on the TV (especially since I use the cable remote) and then set the TV to a setting other than natural.I had the TV repair guy out (best buy warranty) and he said he sees alot of this with rear projection TV's but usually not in only 6 months of use. (this burning actually happened after 4 months if use) Replacing the tubes cost as much as the TV.Learn from my mistake if you purchase this TV :)","Date":"May 13, 2005"}

I had a 53hx71 that I recently sold, and I bought this set from Amzon last week. The shipping was the only headache and most of that was me wanting some instant gradification.I live in LA and the TV was shipped out 5 hours away... but yet it took a week to get... thats stupid. Its annoying when you track it and it says its at LAX (20 mins away).. I wanted to walk it home!The actual TV is AMAZING.. the regular cable looks great, and this is the first series I have seen that you dont noticed regular tv being stretched!! The HDTV rocks, the only negative thing I can think of is having to adjust all the inputs because its shipped with the contrast at 100!...take that down to about 48...Seriously, this tv is a HUGE bang for a small buck.","Date":"October 19, 2004"}

I bought this TV back during 2004 Thanksgiving sale from BestBuy and paid about $1350. It took about few weeks for the picture tube to break in and show its real colors ! Then I had a technician from best buy come over and calibrate it (as you may already know that Rear Projection TVs need calibration, but if you have the bestbuy protection plan they would do it for free at your home). Ever since then all my friends come to my place to watch the big games, movies and even to play xbox in widescreen - and everyone just drools over the picture quality. The picture is crisp, specially when watching HD content and watching movies on DVD. I do not watch analog channels since almost all of them are in HD now for a small difference of $7 or so per month. I looked at Sony, Samsung and Toshiba - Toshiba won the race by a mile. Here are a few things worth mentioning about Toshiba 51H84:- Picture is absolutely crisp- Colors are beautiful (try watching Shrek on it)- Even movies in 4:3 look great- Size does matter ! I was about to settle for 42 and I am extremely glad I pushed myself to 51\"- The multi-choice zoom feature will satisfy your appetite to zoom any sort of programming.- 7 inputs including HDMI (I use Component and am satisfied)The only negative:- Doesn't have a built in HD tuner, so you cannot use its cool Split (2 screens) and Channel Scan feature (split screen in 12 screens).  It has 2 inputs for Antenna, I connected one to the cable box and other bypassing the cable box, so I can screen the channels in analog (using TV's analog tuner) and then watch it in HD.There is a false rumor that Toshiba's doesn't do a good job with green - Not true ! Myself and few of my friends spent hours looking at 3 different brands and Toshibas (after calibration) does the Best job with all R G and B (Sony RPTV didn't do a good with Reds) !Calibration is the key - make sure you spent some time to tune it after few weeks of picture tube breakin period.I would recommend this TV as a big bang for your buck !","Date":"March 26, 2005"}

I was excited to get it home, and had no idea what to expect.

I re-adjusted it and it was fine... until it did it again, and again usually about a week apart.Then about a month and a half later, while watching  a movie, it did the same 'pop' noise, only this time it shut itself off. It would not turn on, and the red power light was flashing. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked.The service call was to be the following week, that weekend it turned off again, and this time nothing would bring it back.The service tech had to take the chasis with him and 2 days later they returned with it, saying they had replaced 2 of the chips, (related to convergence), and 2 fuses.The picture was much improved in all cases and I thought, \"OK, I just got a TV with a couple of bad chips.\"Exactly 2 weeks after the repair, it made a 'pop' sound and the convergence went out of whack. I re-adjusted it and it was fine... until it did it again 2 days later.

{"Title":"Great TV for the Money","Author":"Tom Welling \"Tom\"","ReviewID":"R3AL90S7GV4YDK","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have had this TV now for almost a yr. When I was looking at getting an HDTV I did so much research. I read a million reviews and user opinions. I first bought a 50\" Samsung DLP. What an amazing TV. Still to this day, that TV is the best TV for the least amount of cash. Don't get me wrong. No DLP is cheap. I put the order in at Brandsmart. Then I went home and realized that I didn't need to spend $3800 for a TV. That included a stand and 5yr warranty. So the next day called my sales guy and canceled the order. I first was going to buy this TV, but went with the DLP. Well after feeling buyer's remorse I got the Toshiba 51H93 instead. I got it for $1350. It came to around $1750 after delievery and 5yr in house service contract. I was sold!!!So about the TV. The remote is cool. It lights up Blue so you can see in the dark. The picture is actually very nice. It all depends on your connection. If you have HDTV from your cable them get this TV. Regular-Digital Cable is def alittle blocky, but not nearly as bad as most Rear Projection TV's. It has a built in converter to make even a regular cable go to 1080i. Don't expect that it will equal HD though. On a DVD or HD signal, the TV is breathe taking. I have had no problems, knock on wood so far. I have an Xbox hooked up, very crisp picture. There is plenty of connections (2 HD), and SD card reader (can take out SD card from digital camera and just plug it in and see your pictures-very cool). The speakers are amazing. I still can't believe that a TV has such a good sound. The bass is overwhelming. I actually had to do into setup and lower the levels. I have a nice surround system which compliments it well. But most of the time I just use the TV unless there is a big game or DVD on.If your looking for a cheap HDTV, look no further. The technology is definitely outdated (rear projection). But for the price you can't beat it. Just remember, even if you buy the best LCD, in a yr from now the new model will blow away your older one. So why spend $4000-$10000 on a TV that will be outdated in less than a yr. This is why I went with a Rear projection. I figure spend the least amount now for the best you can get, and then in a yr or two I can get a better TV. Just think, you can get a $8000 LCD now or buy one $4000 now and then in a few yr's spend another $4000 on a newer LCD. I would bet the farm that the second LCD will be far superior to the $8000 now. I think you ge the point.Well good luck in your purchase and enjoy your new Toy. Take care","Date":"January 28, 2005"}

I have a dvd and vcr hooked up to it and have to say the picture quality is excellent.Just a couple of things I have found out when I got the set that should be known.  When you get the set delivered wait an hour or so before you turn it on. This will bring the set to room temperture.  It may sound foolish, but if the components of the tv are cold and you immediately turn the power on they could get expand to quickly and could crack. The set may have been in a delivery truck for a day or two in a cold climate.When you finally do turn the set on make sure you hit the one touch control on the front, it automatically adjusts the unit for your environment.  One other thing. For some reason the manufacturer adjusts the contrast to 100.  I would knock it down to about half of that or whatever you are comfortable with.Remember this is a projection tv so the best way to view it is about ten feet away and in a sitting position.All in all, so far I am very pleased with the set and recommend it highly.","Date":"February 24, 2005"}

It was only 7:30pm and there normal hours are 8am - 7pm. Thats pretty bad when a multi billion dollar company cant even have 24x7 support.

It has performed flawlessly for thousands of hours since then. As for its technology being outdated (RPTV), and its maximum resolution being less than the maximum available (1080i), I think it has taught me to sympathize with those throwbacks who hang onto their vinyl LP's.  As my ears are unable to distinguish between digital and analog sound due to a long history of attending rock concerts, my eyes still function quite well (with correction).  I find that the latest generation of HDTV's, especially with hi-res digital content, yield a very \"digital\" looking result. I also own a 1080p 120Hz LCD TV which often gives an unreal overly digital looking result. The anachronistic RPTV yields a more realistic experience similar to film IMHO. I will keep watching my RPTV until it quits for good.","Date":"January 28, 2011"}

I have a HDDVR, DVD player and VCR hooked up to it and have to say the picture quality is excellent especially with the big action DVD's.

{"Title":"Delivery and Defect Problems Resolved","Author":"Gail","ReviewID":"R2Q03WXMDQXKQF","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this product on Febr. 24th and it was delivered to my home on March 2nd.  The TV was unpackaged in the truck and carried just into the door of my home.  It was not turned on and inspected as promised in the Amazon shipping information.  My son signed for the delivery as I was out of town.  Upon my return, I noticed there had been delivery damage.  The fabric on the bottom of the speaker grill was scaped and torn when the TV had been dragged over the sliding-door jam.  Also, the TV had a manufacturer defect with a fixed black spot on the screen.When I contacted Amazon (via email), they initially said too bad--the TV had been signed for.  I contacted the delivery company and they said they would be responsible for the damage even if Amazon does not cooperate with the claim.  Through either my followup email with Amazon or the persistency of the delivery company, I was shipped a new TV so the problem was resolved with a little persistency. By the way, if you want to talk to Amazon, the phone number is 800-201-7575.I also asked Amazon to not penalize my early purchase by honoring the $100 gift certificate promotion that started Febr 28th.  Afterall, most companies have a 30 day low price guarantee.  Again, I was told \"too bad\" by Amazon. Amazon does have a 30 day low price guarantee, but promotions are considered outside of the guarantee.I contacted Toshiba about the defect and I was given the name of a local authorized service center.  The TV was promptly repaired by removing a small speck of plastic from the lens, problably dislodged when a cabinet screw was installed.  The service person said that he rarely works on Toshiba TV's as they are very reliable.Apart from the delivery damage, the product is excellent, despite the old technology. Adequate space and a wide viewing angle are not issues with my location of this TV, so I went with the proven technology, longer expected product life and much lower price tag. I still have an analog cable signal, so a high definition TV accentuates flaws in the signal.  Like all rear projection TV's, the blacks are not as intense and the picture suffers when viewed at wide angles.  I will not be able to fully appreciate this product until I have a HD signal. But, cartoons, video games, and DVD's are really cool.Prior to purchasing this TV, I tried to read a lot about the various technologies and I found the Crutchfield website to be one of the most informative about HDTV.  Crutchfield does not sell this old technology. I also looked at other various on-line dealers.  Beware of both delivery AND shipping charges.  Frequently, prices are quoted without including both charges so the ultimate price is not disclosed until very late in the purchasing process.I was hesitant about making such a large purchase through a mail order vendor because Amazon does not have the best reputation when it comes to problem resolution.  However, I did have a good outcome with a little persistency.","Date":"March 10, 2005"}

{"Title":"One of the best plasma TVs, simply gorgeous","Author":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","ReviewID":"R3CMOIP3AO648A","Overall":"good","Content":"I usually recommend LCD TVs (esp. Sharp Aquos) over plasmas, mainly because the LCD screen lasts longer, is brighter, consumes far less electricity, and does not suffer the burn-in problem as plasmas.But if you are set on getting a plasma, this Panasonic \"Veira\" 42\" is one of the best plasmas on the market today.  This HDTV set (with built-in HDTV tuner) is fully 720p and 480p native, and can scale 1080i content gracefully.  (BTW there's very little 1080i content available right now.)  The picture quality is simply gorgeous, with brightness and details that rival LCDs.  Color reproduction is excellent, making watching Nature on PBS such a wonderful experience.  The screen's response time has improved over earlier models, so fast-action sports looks good instead of ghostly.  The Veira also has a Cable Card slot and although I haven't tried it, a recent New York Times review says it works seamlessly with Cable Cards.  (Cable Cards can replace set-top cable boxes; check with your cable provider for details.)To get the most out of DVD movies, get a digital-output (HDMI) DVD player from Panasonic, Sony or Denon.  These players can \"upsample\" DVD's standard-NTSC resolution and provide somewhat better video quality when you play DVDs on an HDTV like this one.  The Panasonic player in particular is a great value and a perfect match for the Veira.While I still think LCD TVs are a better value for the long term, the Panasonic, along with plasmas from Fujitsu and Pioneer, does give you the best possible picture out of today's state-of-the-art plasma technology.  I have friends who own Panasonic and they are all very happy, even the ones with the EDTV (instead of HDTV) sets.When you buy a big screen TV, you are making a serious investment (unless you just won the Mega Millions or Powerball), and I highly recommend you buy the best you can afford.  Sub-$2000 plasma TVs have poor image quality and are likely to break down quickly, plus they are very noisy.  Just go for the best after you get over the SAF (spouse approval factor) hurdle!  The Panasonic Veira is a great value considering its top-notch image quality, gorgeous styling and built-in HDTV support.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

Had it for couple of weeks now, and am amazed at the quality of the display. Got HDTV from comcast cable and the HDTV channels look and sound great. Of course I wish there were more HDTV channels. I recommend using the Monster DVI-HDMI cable. This TV has a HDMI port. I also recommend Samsung DVD player HD-931 that generates HD outputs via DVI for your DVDs. The resultant image quality is excellent, even though it is not \"TRUE HD\".An update. It has been a year since I last updated this review. This TV is still one of the best plasma displays in the market. Pioneer plasma is the only one that looks slightly better. I have added monster power supply to my setup and have replaced the cable with satellite. More HD channels on the satellite. Monster power supply is essential to keeping your expensive home theatre setup safe from power quality issues. Have also added Onkyo A/V receiver to my setup along with Cambridge speakers. Had zero issues with this display. Was a little bit apprehensive of dropping big dollars on this display. But so far, it has given awesome performance and zero problems.","Date":"July 13, 2004"}
{"Title":"Glitch in the TV","Author":"JDev","ReviewID":"RONU7C98XFXJX","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this plasma TV through Amazon 4 months ago.  The transaction and shipping went very smoothly. I also purchased the wall mounting bracket through Amazon (an excellent value for only $150).The TV is great -- excellent picture and great audio for those of you who do not use their surround sound system every time the set is on.  However, a problem recently surfaced a few days ago: When playing DVDs on the Component 1 channel, the picture on the screen is no longer centered -- it is offset by about 20% to the left side.  After trying to remedy the problem myself, I contacted Panasonic Customer Service (be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes on the phone before being connected to a representative).  After explaining the problem, the rep indicated it would warrant a service call by a repair person (as of this writing, the appointment is scheduled within the next few days) Luckily, the warranty covers in-house repairs for one year, but you do have to remove the TV from the wall mount yourself so it is accessible to the repair person.I'll admit I'm a bit skeptical about the reliabilty of the TV now, especially since it developed this problem within 4 months.  I'm not a fan of extended warranties (very expensive for this TV, considering an extra year of coverage through Panasonic costs around $400), but I may have to purchase one if any additional problems surface.Hopefully, the problem with my Panasonic is a rarity.  I  expected better performance from this expensive purchase. Time will tell.","Date":"March 15, 2005"}

It has all of the same tech specs (plus more) as the main competitors. It is bright and crisp. Normal TV signals (via a cable for instance) look lousy since the display is capable of so much more, and kinda amplifying the poor standard TV signals.  BUT, throw a DVD, HD or even DIGITAL cable signals at it and be prepared to fall off your chair! Amazing!This unit has LOTS of signal inputs, and the built-in ATSC HD tuner even finds HD channels my cable provider (comast) says don't exist on my wire!The unit suffers from the same power supply noise that nearly all plasmas do. Almost non-existant, but if you put your ear up to it with no other sound in the room, it IS there.The embedded operating system is a bit sluggish, and switching between video feeds is a bit slow, but usable. Also, it is quite particular in which types of image files it will display. I have found ONLY images that have been recorded on a camera work. Nothing that has been EDITTED first displays.Last note: The unit is plasma... which means it's USEABLE half-lifespan is something like 50,000 hours. What is a half-life span you ask? It is the number of hours that the set is operating before the BRIGHTNESS degrades to HALF of the original brightness. So, in 50,000 hours, the picture will be 50% darker than it is today. This figure of 50,000 hours appears to be higher than other sets. Good for Panasonic!","Date":"January 31, 2005"}

My Direct TV digital satellite feed looks very good, but there are image artifacts that result in occasional blurriness or distortion. It is a minor annoyance. My progressive scan DVD looks excellent, but still not perfect. (I do not have an HD signal as of yet, so I can't speak to how this looks). The manual is pathetic. The INPUTS/OUTPUTS are very weird. My 20\" Sony Wega LCD has all that it should, but for some reason, Phillips was really on drugs when it made this unit. In order to get the progressive scan quality, I CANNOT simply connect using a Component cable; instead, I have to use Phillips supplied hybrid cable. In fact, when I first tried the component, I got no image whatsoever... just sound. And although it looks like they have a multitude of imputs, several \"share\" a slot. It is very weird. And I simply don't understand a TV being built without AUDIO OUT. Speaking of Audio, the unit sounds just fine, exhibiting good volume and separation. But as I try out the different equilizer modes (Theatre, Music, Personal, etc.), I can detect no difference whatsoever.While I am happy with this TV, I feel that it is overpriced for what it offers; moroever, I feel it is advertised as having more than it really does.  This unit would be a reasonable purchase for three to five hundred less (which I'm sure it will be next year).

For most widescreen LCD TVs, this means a WXGA resolution that is 1366 pixels wide by 768 pixels high.  But this Philips TV is NOT a true widescreen, despite the false claim in Philips specifications; its aspect ratio is 15:9 and its resolution is 1280 pixels wide by 768 pixels high.  So what does this mean in practical terms?  HDTV broadcasts (such as Law and Order on NBC and this year's Superbowl) are in 16:9 ratio; they fill the entire screen in a true widescreen 16:9 TV.  But since the Philips is 15:9, the HDTV broadcast will appear with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen (unless you choose to artificially stretch the picture to fill the screen, making it look distorted, with people  in the picture too tall and too skinny)!  Can you endure black bars at the top and bottom of your screen every time you watch an HDTV broadcast?  Can you accept the fact that the true usable area of the screen when HDTV is employed is less than the claimed 30\" diagonal--that there will always be wasted area at the top and bottom of your TV?  Do not make the same mistake that I did.  Do not be fooled by the false claim of 16:9 screen ratio.

Only one digital input allowed. This is a problem if you have two devices, such as cable box and dvd. However, the digital input only accepts vga or hdmi, so all component feeds must be converted to vga with cable supplied by manufacturer. I think that one could get an analog switcher with video component input and outputs for not too much money. The picture quality degrades with analog signals, even over digital cable. On middle brightness settings, shading and details in dark areas are lost. Correction by increasing the brightness helps to a limited degree, however, you start to lose the deepness of the black and get graying/hazing.

{"Title":"Very Happy with the Sharp Aquos 32G4U","Author":"J. Lawrence","ReviewID":"R5HCJWAPQKITD","Overall":"good","Content":"We've had the Aquos TV for a few weeks at this date and are very happy with the picture quality for standard DirecTV, DVD, and PC viewing.  We have not upgraded to an HD feed yet, but we were honestly surprised by the improved picture of standard DirecTV versus our previous television (standard CRT).Pluses:1) We have found the A/V box design to be great for hiding all the input cables.2) Sharp offers a couple of different stretch modes to choose from.3) There are 6 input sources and ability to assign custom names to each.4) The unit remembers the volume, stretch, and picture settings for each input source.  Sounds like a small thing but it is really appreciated by us.5) The Sharp menus and remote are nicely designed.6) Speakers sound good for listening to regular content.7) TV outputs for video capture.8) Aesthetically pleasing.9) Vivid pictures!10) The stand allows the screen to swivel and pivot for optimum positioning.  The degrees of rotational are small but effective.11) Works very well for PC viewing.12) Placement of the control buttons on top of the panel work nice for us.Minuses:1) Only one S-Video input and it is on the front of the A/V box. Won't be an issue after we upgrade our DirecTV receiver but it seems like an oversight not to include one s-Video input on the back of the A/V box.2) 1080p support is questionable.  This may be an issue in the future as true 1080 becomes widely available.  Perhaps the A/V box can be upgraded.3) Expensive.  We originally wanted a 37\" TV but could not justify the price.  However, we were so pleased with all the features mentioned above that we went with the smaller 32\" versus other less expensive products.4) We are not using all input sources, it would be nice if we could disable the unused inputs so they would not appear in the menu.5) Faint fan noise in the A/V box (this is probably a nit, it's only detectable if TV is muted).Thanks to all the previous reviewers on this product and other products.  The customer feedback really helped us make and informed decision.  It can get confusing with all the different display technologies available.  Also, some products have known defects that you will only learn about from internet research.","Date":"January 1, 2005"}

For features and price, this one is lot better and cheaper.

{"Title":"the TV lost sound...","Author":"P Turtle \"Turtle\"","ReviewID":"R2PQGGBPUQ7WUV","Overall":"good","Content":"i am writing this review because i lost sound on this TV a week ago. I just got the sound back and want to share how i did it (in my case).I bought this TV in late 2004, not from Amazon. The TV over the years has worked fine. A week ago the side speakers attached to the TV monitors lost sound. Luckily i was still able to get sound through external stereo speakers. But it was inconvenient because i could not use the cable remote control to control volume.Initially, i followed the instructions in the manual ('trouble shooting'). One thing to try was to go to Menu (via the TV's the remote control), then Option, then Output Select. But the Output Select was grayed out; i could not get to it. So i just thought the 32\" does not have this option (the manual is for both 32 and 37). i searched the website and got to a forum discussing the no sound problem; some people said the no-sound problem is related to a design flaw, and Sharp will send techinician to fix it for free, even outside the warranty period.So i called Sharp but no such luck. Sharp over the phone made me try various things, including getting to Output Selct, which was grayed out, and they had no clue how to fix that. i specifically asked if i should do anything with the AVC unit; i was told NO. At the end, i was given a Sharp service shop near me, which would cost me $65 minimum (understandable). I decided to do nothing for now; i thought maybe i should just get another TV.Today, God helped me! I read the manual again and decided to press Reset on the AVC system - one reason i never did that was because there is no obvious reset 'button' on the AVC; there is just a small little dot \"inside\". I decided to press the dot with the tip of a letter opener.... the sound came back! i then went to see if Output Select was still grayed out- it is no longer grayed out!!","Date":"March 6, 2013"}

{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}

Thomas","ReviewID":"R2FPBC09W1N2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"If you see this TV going for cheap and your needs are anything like mine, buy it immediately and resist all the techno-junk TV manufacturers are forcing on consumers.First, consider the input into your TV.  If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.  Also gripes on the audio filter, no problem here.  This is a good TV, exceeds my needs, and maybe yours?

{"Title":"Do the RESEARCH the Olevia is tough to beat!!!","Author":"B. Smith","ReviewID":"R2ZJIKK9KUF366","Overall":"good","Content":"I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}

I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.

Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!  Great set, I'm really pleased.","Date":"January 6, 2005"}

The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV.

We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.

{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony).

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars. A solid purchase with lots of upside and only a a little downside. Don't pay more than this machine for some name brand job - mostly they all use the same components anyway.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

My most significant complaint is that transitions between scenes or to/from commercials, and sometimes in scenes with explosions or flashes of light, appear to momentarily confuse the set, causing the screen to go blank for a split second.","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

The only drawback I can think of is that I can't have progressive DVD input if I have HDTV as well. Although small price to pay for a device that does so much.Cheers.","Date":"February 14, 2005"}
{"Title":"pleased for the price","Author":"Chuck Mc. \"Chuck\"","ReviewID":"RWXHT1HQS8MVL","Overall":"good","Content":"[...]I took advice from reviews here and must say after a couple hours of setup and tweaking, I am pleased. I wanted a second PC monitor for gaming. I currently have a 19\" trinitron and this may not be as sharp, but really looks great. For the price, having a 27 inch gaming screen is sweet. The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best. Anything other and my text/fonts looked unreadable. I was close to frustrated and figured this out and it rocks. I wish the TV resolution was as nice. Still seems grainy Maybe it is my cable provider too. I was able to keep my other TV connected to the cable box via the coax connection and using the svideo for my new tv. Side by side, I don't see much difference between a 10 year old toshiba and this new LCD. I do enjoy the PIP though while working on the PC and watching TV on the side. :) Very trick option. Even though the speakers are not earth shattering, they are loud enough for a bed room TV. Lots of connection options with this TV. Not bad for the 800-900 range.Hope this helps. So far, very pleasedChuck","Date":"November 27, 2004"}

Was happy with it, I don't have a DVI enabled HD cable box from TW New York so use the ypbpr connection and thats fine - HD channels look great but not stunning - regular channels are okay but it seems that they carry to much red and the controls on the set don't fine tune it out enough. I have a DVD and the quality was just as good as the HD channels through the component cables.Then the problems started - A flash to a blue screen for 3-4 seconds when their was a large influx of bright light (usually white) and back to normal. Tech support were good and sent a part (new tuner box) with in the week of telling them about this problem.While waiting for the part I noticed that one speaker was not working and contacted tech support again, but this time it has taken 3 weeks for the part to arrive even though they kept telling (after 4 calls to customer support and 2 from them) me it would be here with in the week.Part finally arrives and we organize for a technician to come and replace the broken/dud parts - this is done today May 2 2005  but the speakers don't work. So its back onto customer support.First guy Miguel (one of these people who completely rubs you up the wrong way from the start - and its not the first time I have had the misfortune of speaking with him) - tells me its this and that and we will send another part etc...etc. I told him I wouldn't be happy with that and that the part they have just replaced is defective - I hung up to calm down.Second guy Chris - I tell him exactly the same as the chief muppet above and first thing he said was \"I'll organize customer support to replace the LCD Set with a new one\", simple as that, no ifs or buts,I'll give them a chance with a new set and see how it goes but after that its refund time. I think this set looks good on paper and for the price but from what I've seen written about it on other forums their seems to be to many little problems to make it a really good 5 star product.ProsPrice, Set looks great, excellent cable connection set up choices, no waiting for customer support to answer the phone.ConsPicture quality isn't the best (to much red), sound is a bit tinny and not enough bass, some at customer support need a good slap for being rude.","Date":"May 2, 2005"}

Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed. I can aim the remote at the wall opposite the TV and the remote still works.","Date":"February 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best 27' HDTV-ready  LCD monitor in it's price range..........","Author":"micritt \"mic\"","ReviewID":"R34RA8GJSP5I2A","Overall":"good","Content":"That's because it's the ONLY  LCD-TV in this range that's available. I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

There's not much info out there on this set.  Fortunately, I was swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon.  This TV has a great picture, looks nice, can be used with or without its side speakers, and is one of the cheapest on the market.  HDTV and DVDs look absolutely fantastic.  Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).

I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"FAQ's missing.  Hopefully this will help","Author":"M. CLARK \"mc\"","ReviewID":"R1AFD57LAFBQK9","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw there were problems with the aspect ratio. 3 reviews below me says that the picture looks stretched. There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

Banks","ReviewID":"RL2K8XXMWXA3S","Overall":"good","Content":"I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable.  But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

A toaster I recently bought was packed more securely, and I'd imagine that a toaster is a little less fragile than an LCD TV.Once hooked up and turned on my heart sank.

(Its nice that Amazon does this.)TV #2 didn't fare much better.  There was that lack of packing material again.  When I turned it on it was even worse.  A bright, neon green pixel right in the middle of the screen.  Both TV's were nothing but static on channel 11, too!Amazon was great about taking both back without shipping charges.

I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

When we purchased it, it was half the price of the Samsungs and Sonys of the same size and the picture looked better! Its a 720p and the eye can't tell the difference of 1080p until you get to 37\". It doesn't have as many inputs as today's TVs do, it only has a DVI input, not an HDMI and 2 component inputs (one HD and one 480p) as well as a cable input. I've used a PS3 with it as well as a Dish HD receiver. When we had cable, I used a splitter and connected one input to the HD component inputs and another to the cable and thus enabled its picture-in-a-picture function. The picture is vivid and sharp. If you can find one of these gems, I recommend buying it for a small room or bedroom.","Date":"February 18, 2010"}

Initially I was happy about it because pricing was good for that time and it had several good reviews.  Performance was very good in the beginning.  After a few months, a problem started, everytime you are watching a bright scene (i.e. an explosion, a really white/bright scene like snow) the screen would turn to blue (like a computer).  It would turn into a bluescreen until the bright scene ends (a few seconds usually).  We tolerated this problem because it wasn't really that expensive to begin with and it was a slight inconvenience.  Next problem is the black screen.  Around October 2006, whenever we turn on the TV, the light would turn on (the blue led in front) and you would hear the audio but the screen would shut off.  There would be sound, power and you would hear the humming sound indicating the device is on but no video.  At first you could fix it by turning off the TV, then turning it on again a few times.  It progressively got worse until turning it off and on didn't work anymore.  Around early 2007 we gave it up for dead.","Date":"September 5, 2007"}

Blacks are a little off, but not bad.Sound is terrible.  Throw out speakers as soon as you get this TV, they are worthless.  I think that is the reason they made them detachable.

An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.  For almost as much as the TV, you can get DirecTVs HD equipment - but that will only make HD shows look better.  All the other channels will still look like a blown up JPEG.","Date":"August 8, 2005"}

It is in the bedroom, and used as both a TV and as a computer monitor.The TV performance is very good.  Hooked up to cable (RCN).  Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  View TV from 13feet - picture size comfortable.  Also, the remote works fine from 13feet away. [remote model RC-LTS]As a computer monitor - PERFECT.  Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  I can comfortably sit at the desk with the TV approx. 24inches from my face and work at the computer.  NO MORE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING!!!  Also, to do picture adjustment (menu - picture - auto adjustment - press volume up key) ---> use remote.Did try to use the DVI cable (from a previous monitor) - but only worked sometimes.  Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.

{"Title":"Standard Cable Stations Do Not Come In","Author":"Chris","ReviewID":"R1GM3ID81NNYA0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Don't buy this TV if you plan on watching channels that aren't HDTV.  I bought a LT30HV and I must say that the HDTV channels look outstanding as do DVDs and video games.  However, the reception on normal cable channels is horrible.  This is not to say that it is only bad compared to other HDTVs, but it looks much worse than any reception I have ever seen.  It looks like a very bad UHF signal from pre-cable days because everything is very blurry and it looks like its snowing on every analog channel.  Its basically unwatchable.  The digital channels are slightly more tolerable.  But I have a 5 year old $100 piece of crap 20\" sharp TV that gets crystal clear reception from the same cable box and connection.  I have talked to Syntax about this and they assured me that it was the signal coming into the TV.  Since then I have changed cable boxes, used different wires, tried different inputs, had the cable company install a signal amplifier, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem.  My cable provider (Comcast) offers mostly analog channels for the most popular stations, digital channels for the higher number cable channels and a few HDTV channels.  If your cable provider is the same way, I would STRONGLY advise against buying this unit.  Other than the fact that you can't watch about 75% of the channels from my cable box, the only other complaint I would have is that the remote is very poorly designed.  Also, now that it has taken me a little over a month to figure out that it is absolutely the TV that is causing this, I don't have the opportunity to return it anymore.  So I paid $1000 for this unit to watch a few HD channels... what a ripoff.EDIT:After having this TV for a while, I think my criticism was much too harsh.  Its still true that some analog channels don't come in and the remote is absurd, but I am happy with everything else about the TV.  For some reason about half the analog stations come in fine and half are somewhat fuzzy, though I have noticed similar things with other HDTVs.  The picture on the digital channels actually is fine, I think its a bit underwhelming due more to the signal coming through my cable box.  The picture on the HDTV channels is spectacular.  Maybe other high end TVs reportedly have better colors or whatever but I'm telling you that watching football, baseball, basketball, nature shows, etc is mesmerizing.  Some other nice features that I have discovered are the removable speakers that can be wired directly to your stereo receiver, split screen mode (awesome for watching 2 football games at once) and the numerous inputs available.  Also, the packaging of the TV when I received it was great.  I saw some reviews complaining about the packaging, but I would not worry about that if you are planning on purchasing this TV.Reconsidering, I would give this TV 4 stars instead of 2.","Date":"September 3, 2005"}

Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent.

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. <br /><br />But if you want to find out some more, or see more pictures. Go check out my profile at [...] . My username is virebelrus .

Below is part of a review I wrote on the AVS Forum website.  I think it touched on all the shortcomings of the Olevia.Sceptre 30\" vs. Syntax Olevia 30\" the results are in....I see there are a few threads with folks asking and comparing the Sceptre LCD at (...) and the Syntax Olevia LCD. I had the Olevia for a week and I just got the Sceptre yesterday. I think I'm the only one who's had both, so here is my experience that I posted on one of the threads. I hope this will help those wondering which one to buy. If you don't want to read the results, Olevia sucks and the Sceptre is great so far.-------------------------I went looking for a LCD at a good price. It had to have PAL support since I'm going to use it overseas. Found 2 options, Sharp and Olevia. Sharp 22\" was expensive and was only EDTV, so did some research on Olevia. Well there really wasn't any info out there at all. They mostly do motherboards, LCD is a new venture for them.Here is my experience... The spec's on the Olevia were nice on paper, the price was right....Setup was easy, my wife did it while I was at work. My first thought was that the brightness wasn't very good. So I did some adjusting and got it to look alright, but still not thrilled. I hooked up my Toshiba DVD via component input and played a few movies. Traffic, Finding Nemo, Usual Suspects, LOTR, Final Fantasy, COPS, and a few others. Finding Nemo looked the best, and I just credit that with the fantastic job that they did making the movie in the first place. The reds were really overblown everytime, and it was still not the best brightness. The listed contrast ratio is 700:1 when I originally bought it, now I see it's up to 750:1 and I wonder how they came to that conclusion, I figure it's more like 400:1 in reality. Overall color, contrast, and brightness are subpar.The quality of the remote was the dealbreaker for sure. The volume would change when hitting the channel button, the volume would increase when you hit the down volume regularly. When I pressed track forward on my DVD remote it would change the volume too!! When that happen I knew that using my Sony commander remote wouldn't make a difference. The remote on the Olevia is absolute junk, they must have spent $1 on making it. The 2 items that drove me to return it was when switching from DVD (via Y, Pb, Pr) to the TV input the screen went PINK with a couple lines of static (I could hear the TV audio)! The only solution was to turn it off and on. Then I e-mailed Syntax Olevia with my problems to see what they would say, my message got bounced.....I hope this review will help people make a decision whether or not to buy the Olevia (I had the 30\" not that makes a difference compared to the 27\"). I did some more reading and found the Sceptre Naga III ....It has PAL support and Sceptre is an respected LCD monitor manufacturer. Dell offers their monitors on their website and last year Wired magazine rated their 17\" LCD TV as a best buy.....So from my experience with the Olevia and the Sceptre, the Sceptre is a far better LCD. It's not even close IMO, so if I were you I'd scrap plans for the Olevia and buy the Sceptre. And for the record, I'm not just comparing as joe schmo, I'm an engineer and work in non-linear video editing and photography.","Date":"May 23, 2005"}

all LCDs.  We have had no other problems with one exception.  The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level.  At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3.  It cuts out and fritzs.  I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael","Date":"July 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"Excellent Value","Author":"Sandy","ReviewID":"R12IJBY6FT9Y2L","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't want to spend alot for a flat panel tv and I didn't want a glorified comptuer monitor either.  So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"The Bargain of the Year!","Author":"Couch Tater","ReviewID":"R11HT4BVX95D49","Overall":"good","Content":"My 30\" Olevia LCD TV was delivered two days ago.  I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"Sounds like a crapshoot  LT27HV","Author":"Tom Urbanik \"2jaded2care\"","ReviewID":"R31MPVQ4JEEF4B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have taken the time to read almost 100 of these reviews good and bad, and some people get the lemons, some don't, and some may not even know they got a lemon.Although I did not get my Syntax LCD tv from Amazon, I have purchased other things like pots and pans.  From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia Review","Author":"Thy","ReviewID":"R1JWDD8RLIW3U8","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. &#60;br /&#62;<br />","Date":"December 10, 2004"}

{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}

Thomas","ReviewID":"R2FPBC09W1N2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"If you see this TV going for cheap and your needs are anything like mine, buy it immediately and resist all the techno-junk TV manufacturers are forcing on consumers.First, consider the input into your TV.  If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.  Also gripes on the audio filter, no problem here.  This is a good TV, exceeds my needs, and maybe yours?

{"Title":"Do the RESEARCH the Olevia is tough to beat!!!","Author":"B. Smith","ReviewID":"R2ZJIKK9KUF366","Overall":"good","Content":"I used to sell electronics a few years back when I was working my way through college and it is amazing how inept the majority of salespeople are in the retail environment.  For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!","Author":"Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"","ReviewID":"R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!  Great set, I'm really pleased.","Date":"January 6, 2005"}

The picture is flawless when viewing HD channels and from my progressive scan DVD player. It also looks great with my PS2 using the S-video connection. The picture qauality on regular TV is pretty good as well, and varies from channel to channel. The TV also comes with lots of connections for your peripheral equipment.

{"Title":"Be aware there are single and dual tuner Olevias...","Author":"Otis Maxwell","ReviewID":"R3DNJO27WQDTRU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Olevia LT27HVS (I'm posting my review here because that model is not yet available at Amazon) and am quite happy with it. The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

Long story short if I would have ordered straight through the vendor I wouldn't have to go approx two weeks without a TV.

We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.

{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony).

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size.

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"The practical use review","Author":"J. Kadish","ReviewID":"R37NPTRD382GI6","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought mine in February and I am quite happy with it. Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars. A solid purchase with lots of upside and only a a little downside. Don't pay more than this machine for some name brand job - mostly they all use the same components anyway.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

The only technical problem I've had has been with red static, which I think is my video card more than the TV.  However it's easily corrected by changing the color depth lower and then changing it back.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Olevia, despite not being a major brand.","Date":"November 10, 2005"}

I've got the following devices connected.1) Bose 321 GS II progressive scan dvd/home theater receiver2) Apple Mac Mini via DVI connector3) Directivo via s-video.4) VHS tape player via composit video5) Eyehome (from elgato) via component videoSo quite a collection of devices and the output is excellent! In fact my only complaint is the lack of a quick way to switch sources (as you can guess I switch sources a bit) The screen menu then arrow keys to select the source then the volume + to choose that selection is a bit of a hassle but not impossible. Well OK,two nits, having a way to rename the inputs would be nice too. But really that's about it. I've had a few friends come in take a look at the progressive scan video from a dvd or the DVI input from the mac and go off an order units the next day.I had to deal with support to get my unit upgraded to the 'new firmware' this was an easy and quite enjoyable process thanks to their excellent technical support group.

{"Title":"Good but not great.","Author":"L. Fang \"WiFi  Installer\"","ReviewID":"R3HBNOVJSOSHM4","Overall":"good","Content":"Owned for 2 months now and for the price I cannot complain too much. Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed. I can aim the remote at the wall opposite the TV and the remote still works.","Date":"February 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best 27' HDTV-ready  LCD monitor in it's price range..........","Author":"micritt \"mic\"","ReviewID":"R34RA8GJSP5I2A","Overall":"good","Content":"That's because it's the ONLY  LCD-TV in this range that's available. I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best value in LCD TVs","Author":"L. Prokopets","ReviewID":"RSTPMUT74LLHK","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched LCD TVs carefully before buying the Syntax Olevia LT30HV.  There's not much info out there on this set.  Fortunately, I was swayed by the positive reviews on Amazon.  This TV has a great picture, looks nice, can be used with or without its side speakers, and is one of the cheapest on the market.  HDTV and DVDs look absolutely fantastic.  Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.  However, the savings more than make up for these shortcomings.  Also, as expected, standard cable does not look very good on this (or any other LCD TV).

I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.  I recommend this set highly, given how much the pro's outweigh the con's.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

{"Title":"The LT30HV 30\": Nice picture, but some technical problems and annoying features","Author":"Brandon W.","ReviewID":"R3AL3QWUV4P3AM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV because of the reasonable price and mostly positive reviews.  I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}

CLARK \"mc\"","ReviewID":"R1AFD57LAFBQK9","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw there were problems with the aspect ratio. 3 reviews below me says that the picture looks stretched. There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

Banks","ReviewID":"RL2K8XXMWXA3S","Overall":"good","Content":"I too found configuring the color to be difficult on this one, and the limited resolution for serving as a computer monitor was noticable.  But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

I got mine the day after Thanksgiving, and have been watching it every day since.  I have a good friend with an Aquos, and though it's far more expensive, I can't see any difference.  I sure don't miss my old CRT TV . . .I agree with the criticism that the volume is too high at the minimum setting - but it isn't a major annoyance.

{"Title":"Price keeps my rating fairly high on this 30\" LCD.","Author":"Scrutinizer","ReviewID":"R229HNK8HEBQS2","Overall":"good","Content":"I read most of the reviews here and agree on the following points.1. No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

Everything works as expected. Picture quality is good but not excellent andis reasonable for its price.I seemed to have a really poor IR receiver module in the LCD. The remote has to be within 5' and straight in from of the sensor; otherwise, it just won't work. It is funny that my old NEC TV has a few remote keys that maps to this Syntax remote control. And, my old NEC TV, though farther and almost at 90 degree angle from the remote, kept turning on and off while the syntax LCD was ignoring the keys. I called Syntax Tech support, and he told me that the IR module is probably defective. They will send a new one to me and send some technician over to replace it. Hopefully it will work fine after that. Will follow up with this post.To Tak Leung, who had previous post about the TV turning itselfoff after an hour or so, while browsing the setups, I saw sleep control where the TV would turn it self OFF after the timer expires.

{"Title":"Great value with great picture","Author":"Frontrunner","ReviewID":"R2R4J4LG08Y0QL","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this LCD TV a couple of months ago on sale and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.

Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).

Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).

For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.  I think it is well worth the cost.[...]","Date":"April 2, 2005"}

{"Title":"Am I missing something here???","Author":"Avallach","ReviewID":"R3BKXIX9BH20QE","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw the 27\" version of this TV on the floor of our CompUSA store for $700 (with the rebates) and wondered what was the catch. Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent. Just wish I got my damn rebates!!!!","Date":"March 8, 2005"}

Found no bad pixels on mine and the image is nice and bright.  When attaching to a PC, however, I run it in 1280 X 720 (NOT 768) mode.  Otherwise, there are ghosts and 'auras' around objects on the screen.

{"Title":"Olevia Review","Author":"Thy","ReviewID":"R20FRSL3A0TJZW","Overall":"good","Content":"Well I have just recieved the Monitor/TV. I was surprise how bright is was. I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. <br /><br />But if you want to find out some more, or see more pictures. Go check out my profile at [...] . My username is virebelrus .

{"Title":"Syntax Olevia 27?","Author":"larry fraser","ReviewID":"R6EO4IAW2GI7H","Overall":"good","Content":"Had this monitor for 3 months now.  Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor.  Great for xbox using progressive component.  For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video.  Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt.  Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720).  As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back.  I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal.  Overall I like the monitor and for under $1000 it is probably one of the best buys out there for a 27 inch monitor/tv.","Date":"February 7, 2005"}

The images are clean and sharp and the colors are great. I found that I had make sure all my wire connections were good to the get a good picture.  The DVD image is also great , but I am more amazed with how nornal cable TV looks on this TV. I have been looking for a LCD TV for some time now  and have been reading tons of reviews and going to several stores and thought I would take a change on the Syntax.

{"Title":"Excellent Value","Author":"Sandy","ReviewID":"R12IJBY6FT9Y2L","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't want to spend alot for a flat panel tv and I didn't want a glorified comptuer monitor either.  So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}

I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

When I purchased an onkyo TX-SR702 to transfer the video I could not believe the quality of the picture. I can not believe that any other set could produce a better picture. It takes my breath away!

From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet.

Its first offerings of LCD TVs are already getting positive reviews from users.  ExtremeTech (a PC Mag offshoot) recently reviewed the 30-inch LCD TV and gave it an 8 out of 10.  I also found other positive independent online reviews, so I decided to give this new brand a try, and got the 27-inch model after landing a new job.Wow!  I was very impressed with the image quality of this LCD TV.  I had seen \"low-cost\" LCD TVs from Westinghouse (at Best Buy) and Gateway (at one of the now-defunct Gateway Country stores), and they were disappointing in contrast and image quality.  The Syntax Olevia, despite its silly name, is definitely the best I've seen for this price class.  Of course, if you take a Sharp Aquos or a Panasonic LCD TV side-by-side with the Olevia, the Sharp and Panasonic will be much better, giving you a more vibrant image, but they also cost almost twice as much as the Olevia!  If you are absolutely into the best LCD quality, you have to get a Sharp; they are just the best.

The native scan supports 720p and the internal scaler allows you to view 1080i programs as well.  Hooked up to a progress-scan DVD player, the Olevia makes movies a joy to watch.In summary, the Olevia is a great entry-level LCD TV.

{"Title":"Great Value....But a few bugs!","Author":"C. Tizano","ReviewID":"R1DJTIIEZFD56A","Overall":"good","Content":"I dedicated hours and hours to researching LCD's and Plasma's before making this purchase. The specs on this Syntax (Brightness and contrast) compare to other in the $2500-$3000 range. I decided this was the best value for my needs. The picture is great and so is the sound (with a subwoofer attached).After becoming familiar with the TV and it's functions, I found a few bugs that should be expected from a company just starting to make lcd's. The first is that RCA remotes control the tv. i have an RCA directv receiver and any button I press on the RCA remote turns the TV volume up or down. Luckily I use a RF remote, so I just avoid aiming it in the direction of the TV. Another small bug is that some features such as the sleep timer are not easliy controlled. To set the Tv on a 30 minute timer, you have to click 3-4 buttons. I am used to just pressing one button. The Picture in Picture feature is very complicated and somewhat slow to display the second picture. And remember there is only one Progressive Component and S-Video input, so your hookups are somewhat limited.I consider those con's to be small and do not change my recommendations of this TV. It shows a great picture, has great sound and is quality built. I returned a $3500 Sony for this one and I am happy I did. Save your money and buy this one - Same Picture quality as those name brands. Customer Support is easy to reach and very responsive, and it also comes with a 1-year in home warranty - WOW!UPDATE - Syntax has repaired the remote problem and updated the screen adjustments (Saturation added)and added a few goodies via a software update. They sent me a disc with instructions on hooking a computer to the tv to update. great customer service and they are dedicated to improving already a great product.","Date":"September 14, 2004"}

If it is normal cable like I have, this TV is perfect.  Its resolution will exceed your cable feed.  In fact, an HDTV or even an EDTV, will have to down convert to your feed signal and you may end up with a worse picture than you'd get from this set.  Heck, the resolution of this TV exceeds a coventional DVD.  Also, for occasional computer use this TV has a VGA input, Perfect!Second, consider what you watch.  If you watch movies all the time, maybe you'd want a widescreen.  I usually watch most anything other than movies, so the conventinal aspect ratio I prefer.  Normal programming and sports seems streched and annoying looking on a widescreen to me.  AND GET THIS, a 20\" conventional aspect TV has 12% MORE pixels than a 20\" Widescreen.  The truth of the matter is, TV manufactures push widescreens on consumers not because consumers visually prefer them, but because they are much cheaper to manufacture and they can advertise bigger screen sizes, sneaky!The good:1) Great Price2) Low power consumption (60W, the thing will pay for itself)3) Its less ugly than it looks in the picture4) Great menus and picture control5) Crazy inputs6) Lightening response time (no digital lag)7) Usable speakers8) Good black display (tends to challenge LCD TVs)9) Hey, its a flat panel TV, you just feel cooler watching it and chuckle to yourself for not supporting Sharp and Sony's elitistism promoting advertising and huge profit margains...he he he ha ha haThe bad:1) Whites too bright.  Don't try to watch the winter olympics on this set.  Snow, basketball courts and generally light scenes are glowing bright and if you take the brightness and backlighting down to compensate, the darks are too dark.2) Lowest volume setting still too loud if your watching TV and your loved one is trying to sleep.3) Short power cordI've seem some reviews of this TV complaining of dead pixels, I don't have any.

For the most part, if the TV does not offer a high percentage commission you can bet that the salesperson knows diddly about the product.  There are however a few people who take pride in their work and do there best to fulfill the needs of the customer.  But sometimes you have to do some research and footwork for yourself if you want to save some cash.  Case in point the \"no name\"  Olevia HDTV (ready) by Syntax.  I did a lot of research both online and in-stores before deciding to go with the Olevia.  Originally I was skeptical of a brand I did not know, but after some research I learned that the LCD panel is actually produced by Phillips, now Phillips/Maganavox.  My old Tv is a 14 year old 32 in Magnavox console.  So if this Olevia lasts even half as long as the Magnavox then I am one happy camper.  Despite what the saleperson told me the TV is capable of True HD, has PIP, and very easy hookup.  I was disapointed with the picture at the store, and the sign on the TV did not mention HD ( or any of the great features on this set).  The salesman told me \"no that ain't HD\", he turned pointed to the bright crisp picture on a very expensive Sharp Aquos and said, \"that's HD\".  If I had not already done the reseasrch I would have believed the salesman and thought  the TV was just EDTV (Enhanced Definition-one step down from HD).  It really pays to know what your looking at when you are preparing to make such a large luxury item purchase.  If you did not have time to research a specific TV at home you might benefit from asking a salesperson to see the companies product description booklet(not all store have this, I know SEARS does), this is usually kept near the register and will have everything from dimesions to (most if not all of the) special features of the set.  Believe me, it was not just PRICE that swayed my to the Olevia, I also chose the TV because of the picture quality.  BE AWARE!  At retail stores very often the expensive TV's are hooked up directly to a high quality signal while the more economical models are hooked up on a split feed which has a weak signal and therefore a poor picture quality.  ALWAYS ask to see the TV through a Component hookup directly off of a DVD player or HD source.  You will be astonished at how much clearer the picture is vs. the split feed most sets have in store.  This is exactly what I did when testing my Olevia, and I would say the picture is 85% to 90% of the Sharp Aquos at around half the price.  It really is a fantastic Television at a great price.  And once I got the TV home I was able to tweak the settings and got the picture even clearer!Be careful, take the time to test TV's with the proper cable hookups, if a salesperson refuses to help you talk to a manager.  Satisfying the needs of the customer is their job, don't let a poor salesperson keep you from getting a deal or the treatment you desreve!","Date":"March 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Incredible for the price. Read on...","Author":"I. Kazakov \"I.K\"","ReviewID":"R3PA67STZKFE7M","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me just state for the record that I rarely buy off-brand electronics, and when I do it's minor equipment like cables, etc. But after reading reviews from around the web it sounded like the Olevia held it's own when it came to quality and features. So my journey began...I was very close to spending (...) on a 26\" Sharp Aquos (...). Then I saw the Olevia. For (...) for a brand new set I figured this was a hell of a deal. Not only does the Olevia beat the Sharp in connections and features, it was almost (...) bucks less. So I got one...First thing I did was hooked it up to my PC. On 1024x720 the text was clean, winamp visualizations were awesome, and some of my wallpapers looked incredibly real. Half Life 2 with all settings highest and 16:9 looked fantastic. Then it was time to give it the TV test...I watched a number of sets (Sharp, Panasonic, LG) with regular cable hook-up. They looked like absolute trash, but clearly it was the signal that was coming into the Best Buy/Circuit City stores because the analog cable on my Olevia looks superb. It blows away our old tube tv, and while some channels obviously come in better than others, the general quality is much better than I expected.The Olevia has awesome PiP and PoP features. They allow you to watch more than 1 source at the same time (e.g., dvd and tv, dvd and playstation2). There is a regular picture in picture, a split screen, a 3 PoP (one channel in a big box and 3 others in 3 smaller windows on the right) and even a grid PoP that allows you to view 12 channels at the same time. However, if you're using these to watch different tv channels, be aware that in 3 PoP and the grid PoP only the \"main\" box displays the picture at normal frame rate. The other channels show picture at about 5 frames per second and not at the same time, but consecutively in order. Not a big deal, but something to consider.The connections on the back of the Olevia are more than you'll probably need, and are easily hidden because there are removable panels which allow you to direct the wires through one or two small openings. Awesome.I then put my playstation 2 to work, hooking it up with component cables. The quality CRUSHES composite (red/white/yellow) hookup. You'll never go back. And I played two games, Tekken 4 and Burnout 3, with the progressive scan feature enabled (displays game at dvd quality, 480p). Very, VERY nice. Colors are fantastic, and blacks are very well done.Then I hooked the Olevia up to my Bravo D2 dvd player via a DVI cable. The player features upscaling that can display any dvd in 720p or 1080i (as well as the standard 480p if for some reason you want to use it). With a bit of tweaking of brightness, contrast on both the dvd player and TV I sat down and watched Alien vs. predator widescreen dvd on 720p. WOW!!! The picture is clean, the colors are beautiful, and the sharpness is great. LCDs are known to be bad at reproducing blacks (in other words, the color black, usually it is some sort of dark gray). I cannot complain here. The bravo d2 olevia combination produces dark and rich blacks.How about the sound? TV has two detachable 10w speakers that are surprisingly strong. I hooked the speakers up to an audio reciever and they are now my surround speakers. The TV does have multiple audio outs and even subwoofer out.So, the conclusion? First realize that my comments have one underlying point in mind: I spent (...) on the tv. For that price the quality and features are unbeatable. Most of the other brand name sets costing (...) and up don't even have the features that this tv does. While I'm sure the picture quality on the Sharp, panasonic and sony is a little better, I don't see the point of spending money on those sets unless you are ready right now to get a serious home theatre system.If you're like me, just wanting something good to hold you over until you spend serious cash, buy this tv, and don't hesitate to do it. It has ALL the connections you need, it's dvi has hdcp (which is a copyright protection system which you will need in the future), has awesome PiP and viewing features, 3:2 pulldown, detachable speakers, and a great look (blue led when tv is off is hot). I have had the set for almost a month and have had no problems with the remote, picture or the sound.I wouldn't take this thing back for anything. I got it for under a grand and with the refurbished bravo d2 (...) i have myself a really solid entry level home theatre setup.

{"Title":"Review of 30\" Olevia","Author":"D. Raymond","ReviewID":"R1Z8BRBTO47JLR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recieved this unit today.1. Packaging is absolutely first class.  The unit comes double boxed in very sturdy cardboard.  Everything in putting the pakage together appears to have been done with care for the product.2.  The unit itself is very modern with the silver accents and glowing blue stand-by light.  The speakers are removeable, but arrive attached and wired.  The remote I received was the standard version.  Also included was an XGA cable, power cable, and all necessary manuals and warranties.3. Performance.I have the unit hooked up using the most basic connection, a 75 ohm cable (regular cable wire), from the wall to the unit.  I have an HD box coming from Comcast.  I will post a follow up once it arrives.  I have found that the unit out of the box is 7 out of 10.  There is some red push, but tweaking the controls allows you to get a decent picture.  I would highly recommend using a calibration disc such as AVIA to set all necessary functions.  I performed all calibrations by eye and achieved decent results.Colors are very punchy especially with animation, which I would use to show the set to my friends until HD arrives.  Very clear and vibrant.  I used this as a benchmark for what the set could achieve if properly set.  Again maximum settings can be had using AVIA.  Unfortunately, the DVD player has yet to arrive, so I will have to make do by eye.I tend to use the Weather Channel to calibrate my sets due to the computer colors they employ; plus the fact they have people on screen to allow correct setting of flesh tones.  You get the best of both worlds on one screen.  Blues in the background were very full.  The contrast detail was very good.  General human appearance was natural and not to over done.  Be patient doing your tweaks.  It took me three tries over the course of two hours.  Not a straight two hours, but you get the idea.My settings ended up with sharpness being way down, most color setting near middle, brightness and contrast on the lower side of center, backlight to soft, full screen mode, and noise red. to high.  I was pretty impressed by this sets ability to present a decent picture using the worst possible signal.Pros:Color saturationTweaking flexiblityRelative clarity on a poor signalCons:Some appearance of motion drag; minimal at best, and could be attributed to signal strength.Lack of picture streching modes; however full screen does an excellent job of rendering 4:3 material.  It should be noted that I have had a 16:9 HDTV for about 3 years so I am a bit more used to what the signal supposed to be.Shadows are more of a dark grey than black, but no real information is lost in the shadow.  I took me a while to get it, but tweaking can get you a decent shadow detail.  Again AVIA will reduce your time in doing this.Summary:I will be using this set as a second HDTV in the living room.  I have a 65\" HD set in the theater room and a 17\" HD set in the work out room.  I took a chance on this set and have been pleasantly surprised.  I gave it the worst signal I could and still felt comfortable giving it 4 out of 5.  My only question I have now is whether to go to the 32\" or stick with the 30\".I will post a follow up once the HD box arrives, and I have a chance to correctly calibrate the set.PS: the standard remote works fine, and the buzzing sound is barely noticeable beyond 3 feet from the set.","Date":"February 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great BIG TV for a very low price!!!","Author":"Pyrate83 \"Computer Junkie\"","ReviewID":"R226GG7Z5Z1OYJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on January 3rd and just received it today and set it up.  I did extensive research before buying an LCD TV and this was what I finally decided on.  I haven't made any changes to the picture yet and have only viewed the set from regular CATV but am anxious to hook up my XBOX and DVD player via component cables since the set looked wonderful at HHGregg watching the Discovery Channel in HD.  The audio output via RCA cables to my receiver is unfortunately not as good as the output on my old CRT.  Not a really big deal though.  The set is very well put together and I like the fact that you purchase an extended warranty through Syntax.  The set is of course very bright and vibrant the way an LCD is advertised to be.  I'm looking forward to spending a lot of time in front of this set and believe it was the best bang for my buck.Updated: I have now messed with all of the settings on this TV and the colors it can display out of any input are amazing.  Blacks look black for an LCD with the backlight on just normal.  Red is a little overwhelming but blues and greens never looked better.  If you intend on watching regular cable make sure to have noise reduction on high.  Another thing that is nice is that you can set color and other video options for each individual input.  The remote really is something to be desired.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it just decides it doesn't work, I can't figure it out(guess it's just cheap).  I would like to get a better universal remote but I'm not sure on the codes.  I have heard Philips codes work possibly?  I might also add that I have removed the speakers that came with the monitor since I use my own home theater speakers.  This really makes the monitor itself look very clean and cutting-edge.  I was skeptical at first but please do yourself a favor and get this set!Updated again(January 11, 2005):  I have hooked up my dvd and xbox via component video cables to this set.  To anyone that doesn't already know, this set does do progressive scan, only on one of the component inputs though.  I saw someone say it didn't do progressive content but it does, 480p and 720p as well as 1080i.  Also, 480p is NOT HD, 720p and 1080i are HD though.  Video games look absolutely detailed and stunning however I wasn't as impressed with DVD content displayed at 480p.  DVD content was very good overall but the sharpness that I experienced when playing the XBOX in 480p just wasn't there.  I have also found it a bit difficult to find the correct picture settings that give me the most pleasing picture.  I am still tweaking the settings though and hopefully I will have them the way I want soon.  My main issue is getting skin tones to look accurate on both regular TV and DVD...the skin color always looks a little washed out but I'm sure I can fix that.  I have also seen some people mention the buzz on this set.  There is a very slight hum that is only audible if you put your ear right up behind the set in a perfectly quiet room.  I swear, this set is super quiet as an LCD monitor should be.  Read the reviews on [...] and [...] I only saw one poor review and that was on CNET.com.  PC magazine even gave it 4/5 stars!  Great set, I'm really pleased.","Date":"January 6, 2005"}

{"Title":"Be aware there are single and dual tuner Olevias...","Author":"Otis Maxwell","ReviewID":"R3DNJO27WQDTRU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Olevia LT27HVS (I'm posting my review here because that model is not yet available at Amazon) and am quite happy with it. The problems with the remote control and buzzing and occasional loss of signal that were mentioned by earlier reviewers are nowhere to be found in this current model. The pixels don't seem quite as sharp as on my 15 inch Philips, but inch for inch the price can't be beat so it still gets 5 stars.HOWEVER, you should be aware that the \"S\" after the model name of the newer sets stands for \"single\" rather than dual tuner. This difference would only be important if you want to watch two standard definition, off-the-air channels at once. Doesn't matter to me. The P-in-p, multiple display option is still included though I haven't tried it.I also want to mention that the 30 inch and 27 inch seem to have the same form factor; the 30 inch fills the frame more completely with more picture and less trim. So if you're buying with a maximum available space in mind, and have a few extra $$, consider the 30 inch.","Date":"July 1, 2005"}

We have copied several hundred hi-res images of our favorite paintings from the web into the screensaver so when we are not watching TV or using the computer, the set plays music from iTunes and displays random art images on the screen.

{"Title":"Great LCD at a great price, with a few quirks","Author":"Chachi","ReviewID":"R3JP8FHNZ2UD4J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the TV for almost a week now and love it.  The picture quality is fantastic, the pixel response is fast, and the quality is solid.  Most reviews tout the strengths of the unit, so I'll focus on just the negatives.1. \"Zoom\" mode zooms in on the widescreen image, not the 4:3 image.  This results in everything being stretched out a bit.  Zoom is useful for removing the letterbox bars on 4:3 images, but what's the point if it still stretches out the image?  Of course, if you watch any letterbox movies on a progressive scan DVD player you won't have this problem.2. If you plug a 480i source into the Y/Pb/Pr input, you get picture noise.  Syntax support says that it's because all signals that go through the Y/Pb/Pr input go through a comb filter which causes interlaced signals to become noisy.  So if you have a game machine like the Playstation 2 that plays some games in 480i and some in 480p, you have to change the cable to the proper input depending on the mode of the game.3. Most universal remotes can't be programmed to control this TV because Syntax is a new brand.  You have to get a remote whose software can be flashed, like the Logitech Harmony 659, in order to control the TV with a universal remote.Despite these shortcomings, I'm very pleased with this display.  HDTV content looks fantastic, and DVDs are super-sharp.  And you can't beat the price.","Date":"November 17, 2004"}

I did my homework before buying this particular brand/model and I felt the quality was the same level as similar, more expensive TVs (like Sony).

{"Title":"Can't beat it for the price","Author":"Kary English","ReviewID":"R28GJJIMYVB9V5","Overall":"good","Content":"We read technical reviews of this LCD HDTV-ready unit on Cnet, anandtech and extremetech before we decided to buy it. Two of the three gave it great reviews (8 of 10 at extremetech) and one panned it. We are glad we took the risk. The picture is amazing. We keep seeing things in DVDs that we never knew were there. Sound was only ok. Decent for a television, but if sound is your object, get a home theatre system (we're running this through the Panasonic 820V - see my other reviews).  I can tell a difference between this set and truly high end plasma or LCD sets, but the difference is small and not worth the high end price. Example: extremetech gives 9 of 10 to a same-size Sharp AQUOS LCD, but you'll pay double the price of the Olevia.Pros:Amazing picture, sharp even from two rooms awayGood size for a small roomUnbeatable price to value ratioAdequate sound as shipped, easy to route through a home theatre systemPC connection was almost plug and play, required 5 mins of fiddling with my laptop, but that was my laptop's problem, not the TVsIt's light - I could lift it and maneuver it by myselfGamer chick note - World of Warcraft looked so great I could just crySet-up and technical menus are fairly easy to navigate once you deal with the balky remoteThis thing is packed like Fort Knox, double-boxed, custom cut plastic foam inserts etc.  The outer box had some dents but the inner box and the unit were pristineCons:Print manual is basically useless. Included DVD is not any betterRemote is poor quality: tiny range, buttons are not intuitive or even logical, they require several pushes and response time to the remote is SLOW when changing channels (5 sec - I counted) We use our DVD remote for most interactions though, so this is a minor issue to me.Can't evaluate cable picture as I don't have cableOff-the-air tv looked pretty bad, but with no antenna to speak of, that's understandableOverall vote:  No regrets. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.  My final decision was between this and a Sony Grand Wega 42 inch LCD projection model, and I chose this one. The picture is better despite the smaller screen.If the most important aspect of a television purchase for you is picture for price, this is the one to get. If you can afford a grand or 4 more, look higher up.Edit: This television died a noble death on September 4, 2012, missing the 8-year mark by a mere two months. The symptoms suggest an issue with the power supply, and reported repair costs would equal the cost of a new machine. We've ordered a 32\" Samsung, not out of any dissatisfaction with this model, but due to good reviews on the Samsung.  RIP, Olevia - you served well.","Date":"December 17, 2004"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"philo_vance","ReviewID":"R9EA3MGKYGF1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't want to take up your time repeating the praise that previous reviewers have heaped on the Syntax. It is a great TV and a great value. I'd just like to make a few points that others may not have covered.Many have commented on how good HD and DVD content look. I have digital cable (Optimum IO) and SD looks great too.When you watch SD content (and most programming is still SD) on a widescreen HD TV, you need to change the set's Aspect Ratio to 4:3, otherwise the image will be stretched horizontally and look unnatural. You can do this easily with the Syntax. Black bands appear on either side of the image and only the center portion of the screen is used. But when you do this, you no longer have a 27 inch TV! Its just geometry. When you use the entire widescreen, the diagonal measurement is 27 inches. Give up part of the screen to either side of the image and what's left will no longer have a diagonal of 27 inches. I'd estimate it at around 22 or 23 inches. So, if you're replacing a 27 inch conventional TV, SD programming is going to look significantly smaller. You may want to investigate Syntax's 30-inch model if this is the case.As other reviewers have pointed out, the Syntax, as it comes from the factory, has a serious oversaturation problem with red. But you can fix it with available controls. There is a \"Red Gain\" adjustment on the \"Picture\" menu that can be reduced to restore a more natural color balance and stop the reds and oranges from looking radioactive.Lastly, if you intend to submit a rebate to Syntax, do so quickly. Most rebates I've seen give you 30 or 60 days from the purchase date to get your envelope postmarked. Syntax gives you only 15 or 21 days. When your set arrives, take a few days to evaluate, decide if you want it, and then get that rebate in the mail. From what I've read, Syntax is *not* forgiving about late submissions.This set lacks only 2 things - a big name and a big price. I've had mine for about 3 months and it makes me smile every time I switch it on.","Date":"May 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olevia 30inch LCDTV is great!!","Author":"Robert B. Harvier","ReviewID":"RPHI0O5YIB9CE","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't order this from Amazon.com, I purchased it from a local retailer.  I have to say this is one excellent piece of technology.  LCDs have always been way out of my price range... that is until I saw this TV.  The picture quality is great, even standard definition looks good (regular cable).  Digital cable looks better, DVDs look great and HD is excellent.  The speakers are loud enough, but if you are buying an LCD chances are you already have a home theater system.  I love the look, the PQ and the layout for all the wiring.  That doesn't mean this TV is perfect.There are some flaws, but none that are bad enough for me to return it.  There is a buzzing that comes from the back light or the power supply, fortunately to make it go away, set the back light to BRIGHT.  As I said earlier, the speakers are loud but not really great, they are very easy to remove.  The OSD doesn't give you the greatest control of the color saturation, but if you call Syntax they will send you a software upgrade and a new remote (mine will be here next week).In the end, this TV isn't really for the home theater enthusiast (those are the guys that buy boutique items or that 60 inch Sony plasma I saw in town), but for the general public, especially with such a low price.  You do get the best bang for your buck, especially when the next comparison model is on average $1500.00 more.PS: Someone on here stated that it will distort 4:3 pictures if you use full screen.  That is true, but the distortion isn't that bad.  Anamorphic DVDs and HD come in without distortion using the full screen.  Widescreen programming on regular cable 4:3 can be zoomed in to use the full screen without seeing the black bars on top or bottom or without any distortion.","Date":"February 11, 2005"}

{"Title":"Great TV for an unbeatable price","Author":"kittyworld","ReviewID":"R2J0GBXUGCX723","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV for myself as a Christmas present, and I love it so much! Regular TV programs and video images looked beautiful right out of the box. The color is vivid and pictures from my new progressive DVD also looked very sharp and gorgious. I do not have HDTV so I can't say anything about that. The only complaint I have is that all the connections are in the rear, and since I placed the TV in a shallow bookshelf close to the wall, it's not very convenient to connect/disconnect game box or camcorder. The TV itself is heavy - I imagined it to be very light like a picture frame but it's about as heavy as, if not more than my 20\" CRT TV. However I have nevered owned another LCD TV before so I have nothing to compare with other than my 17\" computer LCD monitor. Overall I am very satisfied w/ this TV. Its quality is probably about the same as those name brand sets that cost twice as much for the same size. I bought it from Target while on sale and even including tax the total price comes to less than $950 (shipping was free too).","Date":"January 2, 2005"}

(this problem is way worse on my second unit than it was on the first.)  the sync loss takes several seconds to restore itself, and during that time audio cuts out as well.  there is a fix for this apparently, and i'm waiting for syntax to ship me a replacement component-input module (easy user installable piece).- the reception of remote codes is terrible -- i've programmed my tivo remote to generate tv power/mute/vol and i have to point it directly at the tv, and sometimes even then i can't get it to work unless i'm within 6' of the tv.  contrast this with the same remote sending signals to the tivo -- i can bounce tivo signals off several walls and the tivo still receives it.  (the situation is even worse with the provided remote.)- the input selection system is painful -- there's no code for taking you direct to a specific input, nor is there a code for cycling through the inputs.  you have to click the input button, then cursor through a menu, then hit the right arrow.- the front surface of the tv runs around 105F.  i haven't compared other LCD TVs, but i figured it's worth mentioning that it will be warm.- two good things to say about the warranty replacement tv:  its VGA downsampling seems to be much improved over the original model; and the remote is actually compatible with some RCA codes (and so i was able to configure the tivo remote to talk to it).  the old style remote (which is actually more sleek and less boxy) is not supported by the tivo report.  other web forums indicate people have successfully called syntax to get a software and remote update.overall i'm satisfied, and i would be happy if i hadn't had to deal with replacing one unit, and worse, having to call to get a replacement module for the warranty replacement tv... you'd hope warranty replacement tvs direct from syntax would include such fixes already.","Date":"September 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"The practical use review","Author":"J. Kadish","ReviewID":"R37NPTRD382GI6","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought mine in February and I am quite happy with it. Picture is crisp and the colors are bright and realistic. As others have said the remote lacks some simple shortcuts like 1 touch input select as I use this item for Cable, Computer and Xbox. It can be a pain to have to go through menus and then use the volume button to enter the selection.Cable - picture quality of regular cable is pretty lame especially when using the new HDTV box Time Warner gave me. It is unfortunate that they have chosen to pick the aspect ratio for you... you cannot get a regular 4:3 on normal programming. So everyone is fat. But change it to HD channels and I am in heaven... didn't stop watching Discovery HD for a week... Not to mention NASCAR Races in HD are an awesome thing to watch. One bug to report... Using the Yr Pl Pb setting for the input the screen goes blue whenever there is a large amount of white filling the screen... I am sure this would be resolved using the DVI cable which I haven't gotten yet.Xbox - got the Olevia and Halo 2 at the same time. I have never appreciated a video game like that. The monitor just opens a whole new world to video games bringing you so much closer to the action. I regularly move out of the way of incoming projectiles... so the reality factor is out of this world.Computer - I just bought a new Sony Viao and cannot get the screen to work well. Aspect Ratio is again an issue - everything is fat. Pictures are not as sharp as HDTV so there is some kind of resolution mismatch. I am very good with computers and haven't figured out a fix yet.Sound - good for a everyday TV but not excellent. There is also a compressor built in - I guess to protect the speakers. Home Theater setup is a must. As soon as a sound gets loud the compression kicks in and lowers it.If this monitor worked well with the computer I would have given 5 stars. A solid purchase with lots of upside and only a a little downside. Don't pay more than this machine for some name brand job - mostly they all use the same components anyway.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

No it does not quite have the picture of a $4000 or $5000 plasma or more-expensive projection LCD, but, it is simple to set up, has all of the appropriate connections (except an optical audio-out - bummer), and, plays DVD and HDTV beautifully.  For the small picture quality sacrifice (compared to units twice and three times its price), Syntax puts this TV within the financial reach of working-class folks.  Some bemoan the remote - it really isn't that bad.Buy with confidence - but - see it in person if you can before buying to better preset your expectations.

I wanted a second PC monitor for gaming. I currently have a 19\" trinitron and this may not be as sharp, but really looks great. For the price, having a 27 inch gaming screen is sweet. The games look really nice and response time is fast. I then setup the S cable for cable and routed the audio in as well. Once I fixed the resolution on the PC, it actually is a better PC monitor then TV I think. Hint, set your computer resolution to 1280x 720. This seems to be the best. Anything other and my text/fonts looked unreadable. I was close to frustrated and figured this out and it rocks. I wish the TV resolution was as nice. Still seems grainy Maybe it is my cable provider too. I was able to keep my other TV connected to the cable box via the coax connection and using the svideo for my new tv. Side by side, I don't see much difference between a 10 year old toshiba and this new LCD. I do enjoy the PIP though while working on the PC and watching TV on the side. :) Very trick option.

{"Title":"Good but not great.","Author":"L. Fang \"WiFi  Installer\"","ReviewID":"R3HBNOVJSOSHM4","Overall":"good","Content":"Owned for 2 months now and for the price I cannot complain too much. Have my laptop, Playstation, and CATV plugged into it.  Let me start out with the units contast. Contrast, though more like a 550 ratio not 750, is pretty good except in the darker images and scencs.  Played around the the brightness, backlight and contrast adjustments to try to bring out the darker images but could not.  If its kinda dark it might as well be Very Dark.  Unit is not good in showing the variances in darkness.<br />The units color saturation is very good almost vibrant. are Brightness levels are not a problem; even if you have sunlight shining through a window.  The biggest thing that bothers me about this set are the settings for Aspect Ratio.<br />Native on this is 16x10 not 16x9.  This is not really a problem as many other set are this way.  The problem lies with when a Wide screen DVD is played.  If you use the 16x10 widescreen setting is makes the picture seem strecthed extra wide. In this setting you can still see the 2 black bars on the top and bottom.  I hate this because I feel the reason for buying a wide screen tv was to avoid this. If I switch it to 4x3 aspect ration the picture now is even smaller.  The horizontal black bars are now joined by 2 vertical bars on the left and right making the picture seems like it is comming out of a 17 inch screen.  The last setting is ZOOM for aspect viewing ratio.  The nice thing about this settings, i now feel that I'm looking at the full 27 inch screen.  There are no more black bars on the top, bottom or sides.  But the problem here is that is zooms it too far.  Picture is lost or chopped off of the sides and the top and bottom. The only other thing is the proccessor speed in the unit is very slow.  It takes a long time to move between your different sources, CATV, VGA, DVI, and S-video.  Also going in and out of PIP mode is also a lengthy transition.  Otherwise the rest of the unit is fine.  Remote control problem fixed. I can aim the remote at the wall opposite the TV and the remote still works.","Date":"February 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best 27' HDTV-ready  LCD monitor in it's price range..........","Author":"micritt \"mic\"","ReviewID":"R34RA8GJSP5I2A","Overall":"good","Content":"That's because it's the ONLY  LCD-TV in this range that's available. I bought sight unseen online from Amazon. Delivery was when they said it would be, set was undamaged.You get what you pay for. No frills, and you need a set top HD converter or HD cable box to get the few HD channels now available on cable, or you have a roof antenna and you'll get the broadcast networks' HD signals only.Just like back in the 80's when \"cable ready\" confused a lot of people, HDTV-ready, at least for cable and satellite viewers, means additional hardware. Time Warner Cable of NYC exchanged my old box for an HD box at no extra charge. The few channels available now may frustrate new owners of these sets, and Time Warner has the nerve to charge extra for a handful of extra HD channels, like ESPN-HD but just remember, back in the 50's, color television meant buying an expensive set to watch color on one channel-NBC- the first all-color network, until the late 60's, when all networks went color. Same deal with HDTV- be patient, in a few years, all channels will be hi-def.Now, onto the Olevia. I like this set and don't regret the purchase, so far. Set-up is a bit of a chore and time consuming. If you are not electronic-savy, you could have some major problems. This is a component TV, meaning the video and audio signals are connected seperately, so when you throw in a home theater audio system and a cable/satellite box, it can and did take hours to get up and going. Connecting from my Panasonic home-theater-in-a-box DVD player's component output gave the best picture although I did not try DVI connection, and my test DVD, The Matrix, looked and sounded quite impressive.The component cables I  bought from Radio Shack are just fine- hi priced MonsterCable is a rip-off, especially for a set in this price range.One big disappointment is that most widescreen movies on DVD are in fact just letterboxed in 4:3 mode. Meaning you still get black bars above and below the movie image. There is a mode where you can make it full screen, using up more picture area of the screen but losing some of the picture image that was originally filmed. So It's a compromise that one day will be hopefully eliminated once all tv transmission is in HD and all widescreen movies on DVD use the full amount of the 16:9 screen area so you can watch a movie shot in widescreen and see the full image the director shot without any black bars.But don't let that stop you from getting an HD set if you really want one now. Otherwise, wait a year or so, or when HD replaces analog in a few years. This set will probably be under $500 by then.I admit the remote's a bit clunky and hard to use and if you are intimdated by remotes or electronics in general, it's a pain in the a##. Ask somebody you know who is tech-savy to help you set it up or get universal remote. Picture quality on HD channels is outstanding. Discovery Channel HD in particular makes you feel glad you bought the set. Analog channels look granier and not as sharp as on your old picture-tube TV.I recommend this set for an apartment or bedroom, not as the main home theater set unless you have a small living room. If you are replacing a picture-tube set or want to get started with HD without spending thousands of dollars, this is the 27' set to beat.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}

Drawbacks include a menu system that's tough to figure out, difficulty in switching between widescreen and 4:3, and blacks that look gray.

I bought it to use as a computer screen/TV screen.  It serves its purpose very well.  With the PIP, I can browse the net and watch TV at the same time.  I can't think of any other way to consume more media at one time :)  Hooked up to my PC with a DVI cable, games look excellent.  There is little to no ghosting (some noticeable in HL 2, but better than most regular LCD monitors I've found) and colors are sharp.  However, hooked up to my Gamecube (with standard cables) the quality sucks and there is a lot of ghosting.  With standard definition TV signal, the quality is also poor.  I have been told though, that pretty much all LCD's are this way with standard definition, that is why when you go to the big electronic stores they ALWAYS have the LCD's on High Def signals.  PLEASE keep this in mind, because you may be very dissapointed if you are expecting an improvement in standard definition signal.  You are most likely to experience a degradation from a standard tube TV.  However, when hooked up to High Def that quality is excellent.  If you have a Media PC like me, this is the perfect fit.  Running Power DVD for my DVD's, and using the Logitech Z-5500 THX computer speakers, with this TV, and you are looking at a very very nice Home Theater setup for very cheap.  That is where the true value of this set comes in, you get 27\" of desktop real estate for less than $700 bucks.  Keep in mind that the resolution doesn't go higher than 1280x720, so this is a slight drawback.  However, if you are concerned about PC games, keep in mind that you can keep the resolution lower and turn up graphics features such as AA, AF.

Gaming on this screen is excellent with no classic lcd problems. I would definately use the DVI cable though as the vga cable has slight image ghosting due to RF interference. The tv tuner is basic and the picture is mediocre but if you're just using it for digital media like me ... an excellent choice!","Date":"April 14, 2005"}

I have been doing 3 seporate tech project systems in the house and bringing in names like \"Loewe\", \"HSU\", and now \"Olevia\"!I did a lot of research in this this thing and recalled an article saying LCD prices would be falling big this year and thought i would save this purchse for last given it would cost less.  Last week CompUsa ran a deal for $699 and I jsut ran over and purchased it.  I am a big fan of Amazon, but this deal was too good, and financed for 21 month no interest!  For little over $33 per month for the next 21 months, how can I go wrong!  Even if the tv stinks, this is one hell of a computer monitor for the money!I think most of the reviews said most of what needs to be said.  The high def picture is just stunning!  Its hard to compare to the sony as the store images are so bad given the split signals, but the blacks were blacker on the sony.  At $699 I could have bought 3 of these vs. just one 23inch sony!  The DVI input off my Bravo D1 was just incredible.Synatax just released a new 26' lcd for list of $899 with some improvements.  The specs on the Syntax line are incredible for the money, and the 27 set I have has impressed me with its build quality.  I have the new remote, and while its not the best, I really don't mind it at all.  I will be using the cable box one until I get a universal one figured out.In conclusion, if this thing proves durable I will be very happy.  The Warranty does not include the lcd itself so read up on it and consider a suppliment.  At $149 I did spring for the compusa one, although I hate them!  It is very liberal.  I took the 2 year.Pro: Picture quality, state of the art imputs, good looks and VALUE!Con: Skippy brand you'll have to explain to all whom ask!","Date":"March 15, 2005"}

Decker","ReviewID":"R3T0602V44CKXB","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a great deal of research and shopping around before committing to the Syntax/Olevia 30\" set.  From what I found, there is no other product out there of this quality and image level at this price point.  Hats off to Syntax for a great product.  The unit performs as good or better than expected based on other reviews I have read.  Many bad comments on the remote,  but mine works fine from just about any distance, but is a little sensitive to angle.  FYI  If you have a universal remote, you may not find Syntax codes in the manual, so try the various RCA codes available... one of these should probably work... it did with my SA Cable Set Top Universal Remote.I have not seen the TV operate with and HD input yet.  Still anxiously waiting for my cable company to come out and hook me up. The quality on standard Digital Cable is still outstanding, exceeding my expectations, even on an S-video input.  I plan to use the DVI-D interface for HD Cable ..... can't wait!  DVD's are awesome when using Component inputs (Y Pb Pr).  Sound is fine with built in speakers... not great,  but more than acceptable.  I did not notice the audible noise or humm that others reported.The unit is very sleek and stylish and put together well.  It would make a nice addition to anybody's home theater or bedroom, which is where we have ours set up.","Date":"January 29, 2005"}

{"Title":"The LT30HV 30\": Nice picture, but some technical problems and annoying features","Author":"Brandon W.","ReviewID":"R3AL3QWUV4P3AM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV because of the reasonable price and mostly positive reviews.  I understood that I needed additional equipment to pick up high def TV, and component video cables to get high def resolution with my other devices.  After owning it for only a few months, I began to regret paying $1,000 for it. It may be cheaper now, but beware because it has some issues.When I play Xbox and PS2 on this TV, it looks outstanding.  No problems there.  For DVDs the picture is great, but I began to notice a problem with the picture \"blacking out\" and going to a blue input screen every time there was a bright flash.  This also began to happen when watching high def channels on TV.I contacted customer support and they sent me a new A/V box to install myself at no charge.  It was easy to install with just a screw driver.  It seemed to help at first, because DVDs that caused the blackout problem before were fine now.  However, the new A/V box has an even worse time with high def channels on TV, with lines popping up on 1080i signals, and the picture now stays blacked out for longer periods when there is a bright screen.I called tech support again, and they were quick to offer me brand new TV at no charge under warranty.  This doesn't really satisfy me because I think it may be a problem with this unit across the board, not just my individual TV.  The representative said \"The issues you're describing are usually a problem with the A/V box, and since changing that hasn't fixed the problem, we'll send you a new unit.\"  It just makes me think that they see this problem all the time.  Even though it's free shipping, you still have to find a box for it to be picked up in, and they don't ship your new TV until they recieve your defective one.  This whole process is also very slow.This next issue is something I could have looked into beforehand, but found out when I started hooking up different devices for high def.  There's only ONE high def input for component A/V cables!  This means that if you're like me and you have more than one high def device, you'll have buy a component video system selector.  When I hooked up a selector however, I noticed a purple line going slowly down the screen.  When I upgraded to an expensive reciever, this problem went away.  So the purple line might have just been the particular selector I had, but be aware of that potential issue.My last complaint isn't as bad as the blackout problem, but after a while it wears down on you.  The remote is pretty unresponsive and you have to push the buttons down hard.  In addition, there's no quick way to change the aspect ratio.  If you go from watching a high def channel that's presented in 16:9, and surf to a channel that's presented in 4:3, the picture is stretched out.  You then have to surf through sub-menus (with the unresponsive buttons) to fix the ratio.  I'm always changing devices that support different aspect ratios, so this small issue has turned into a pretty large annoyance.  One button to toggle through the different ratios would be much better!This TV gets 3 stars for it's outstanding high def picture (when it's working properly).  If you haven't seen discovery channel HD you will be in awe when you first experience it.  However, this unit looses a star for the blackout problem, and another star for the annoying remote and limited high def input.This TV seems like a great medium-range unit to get you started for high def entertainment.  Just be aware that you'll still end up spending more money depending on what you want to hook up to the TV.  High def component video cables aren't cheap, and if you don't have a reciever or system selector to run your componend video cables through, be prepared to drop more money!","Date":"November 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"FAQ's missing.  Hopefully this will help","Author":"M. CLARK \"mc\"","ReviewID":"R1AFD57LAFBQK9","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw there were problems with the aspect ratio. 3 reviews below me says that the picture looks stretched. There's a solution for this and mine may not be the only solution.My computer was set to 1024x768. When looking at DVD's through my computer or videos through Media Player or Divx the picture looked stretched. I finally found the Olivia help and told them about this. They say that many movies come in wider than the screen. I knew this but I was looking at a TV source and knew that this could not be wider than HDTV standard.I looked around and finally found that answer in a site about a software program that lets you change the resolution from what Windows gives you. I did not use the program. I found that to get the correct resolution from your computer you need that (powerstrip progam) only for the 27\" monitor.The fix for the 30\" monitor is easy. Change your settings to 1280 x 760 (760 always remains the same). I changed from 1028 to 1280 and now movies and everything else from my computer do not look stretched.However, the fonts are a bit difficult to view at this setting so if I'm reading I leave the setting at 1024. I also found that with Divx Viewer I can stretch the picture to the correct size (But not with windows media 10. It may be possible with Windows Media 9)I also found what a lot of people have said. Standard TV, especially with the mediocre Comcast signal I received, doesn't look good. In fact HDTV magnifies any errors.I've seen some HD videos through my computer through VGA cable that looked very good.There are lots of connections on the back. I've done some \"research on the DVI cable and there's not much information. I can accept that it gives a better signal than the RCA cables (white red and yellow old technology). What I can't figure out is if it's better than VGA. What I've learned is that DVI is supposed to be better because you don't have to convert the signal in the computer from digital to analogue and then change that same signal back to digital for the LCD monitor. If it's digital from the computer the DVI cable will render directly from the digital signal. I do not know if DVI is better than any of the other cables (component especially). If I get one I'll try to update reviews.If you need more help with the stretching problem, go to the Powerstrip forums. They may have the answer. I found that I did not have to download the Powerstrip program but if you have a 27\" TV and you are using it from a computer, you may need PoweStrip. However Microsoft may also have a program to render 1024 x 720 or whatever the best resolution is. The problem is that, from what I heard, Windows XP does not come with 720 as a vertical resolution and this is what the 27\" monitor needs.So far I am happy with this. I gave it 4 out 5 because Syntax does not handle this stretching (aspect ration) problem, although it doesn't seem that difficult.I would highly recommend that you also consider getting a wireless keyboard. I do not have one yet, but the monitor is very bright and overwhelming if you sit 6\" away (This is as it should be) I plan on getting a wireless keyboard and mouse to control windows media player etc... Like a very expensive remote control... I plan on getting DVI cable and maybe component cables (though I may not need them if I get DVI)...I also will get a simple signal splitter. My computer already comes with a TV tuner. I need to split that signal so that I can also feed the Olevia TV with the cable signal...I believe that this is a better TV than a computer monitor. I find that sometimes there are not enough pixels to render text. A coma like this \",\" is only two pixels. Not a big deal. I think I still like the fact that I can be 3 to 6 feet away and still read it.There is also a program called TrueType from Microsoft. You can look it up and understand the technology easily enough from their website. You can also click \"turn on\" TrueType and you won't be able to tell the difference on a standard monitor. However on the Olevia LCD you will immediately see the difference. However, I think TrueType only comes wit Windows XP. Those with older operating systems may need to download a special program from MS. However, TrueType only does about a 10%-20% improvement, so if you do not have XP, it may not be worth getting TrueType.For those of you who haven't bought this yet, be careful with the tracking system on Amazon. It's very bad. My Olivia arrived here last Wednesday. The tracking system at Amazon either said \"We do not have information right now\" or \"Leaving xxx on date XXX\". The problem was that it was not leaving. It had already arrived and I had missed the phone call. So I had to schedule on Friday for Next Tuesday (6 days after it arrived). I looked at the Amazon tracking every day, and everyday it said the same: \"no info\" or \"Left dock\". I knew who their carrier was (Eagle) did a Google search for their web site. I was stymied for 3 days, until I finally found the site (there's many companies with the same name and this carrier has also changed websites so their empty website points you to the correct place). Their tracking system actually has the correct information!!!! It said it arrived at my local area and the exact date!!!! However this was not reflected on Amazon.When the Olevia arrived, the carriers were very nice and courteous and accommodating. My wife called and when I arrived they were waiting for me with the Olevia unpacked and ready to be connected. I turned it on, on the floor, plugged the cable on after disconnecting it from my regular TV, tried picture in picture. I signed the paperwork. The movers were very nice and were even going to take the packaging but we chose to keep it.The Olevia only comes with a VGA cable (I downloaded the instruction book weeks ago and it tells you what it comes with). I chose to use that one rather than the one I had. It's a simple matter to connect the cable from the computer to the Olevia....  New edit.  It took me about 4 days but I finally fixed the video.  I am using this with a computer only so far.  with 1280 x 768 My ati RADEON 9200 would not render text well.  (You should use that resolution for movies to have the right aspect ratio).  The solution, and mind you there may be other solutions, was to use the powerstrip program.  I changed all their setting to the reccomended setting, but not untill I set the Frequency to 80.00 did the text become perfect. If you are having a wigly screen when used as a computer monitor, do a search for powerstrip, and look to their forums.  You may also be able to do something by changing the setting on your video driver some other way, but I wasn't able to.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

But overall, it's many inputs and ease of use are big plusses, I've heard it uses standard VESA-100 mounts and its not too heavy to carry between rooms.  The glow, caused by the left and right bezels pinching the lcd, are only obvious when the screen is more than 85% dark.  A 20\" is not a home theater size anyway, and an LCD still exposes all the imperfections of my VCR and Playstation.  There is no ghosting or other glitches and the speakers are quite adequate, obviously minus deep bass but similar to a subwoofer-less computer set.  I think it will allow me to wait until the larger, higher resolution sets get more affordable, or until I'm in a bigger apartment.","Date":"December 30, 2004"}

{"Title":"Price keeps my rating fairly high on this 30\" LCD.","Author":"Scrutinizer","ReviewID":"R229HNK8HEBQS2","Overall":"good","Content":"I read most of the reviews here and agree on the following points.1. No, it's not a Sharp.  This would not compare favorably with a 30\" Aquos in screen response time and perceived resolution, although colors are vivid.2. Operation of this is clumsy, with no direct source selection on the remote.  My hope is that  the IR codes are somehow embedded and someone will discover and publish them on remotecentral.com.3. I am using this in my exercise room/home office situation, and it is very well suited for that kind of purpose, where a larger size & HDTV resolution is desired.  I was able to obtain 1600 X 900 landscape resolution with my Mac G4/ATI 9800 card, which enables dual portrait web pages side by side using the VGA port.  I had no luck with the DVI but gave up trying maybe to quickly.  In conclusion, having seen, owned or installed many HDTV displays & projectors, I would save my money and buy a Sharp if this purchase is intended for your main viewing screen, but this product has many uses and suits me just fine for my purpose where in no way could I justify a $2000 expenditure.","Date":"April 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price to Quality Leader","Author":"Scott","ReviewID":"R33K9KB5JVQ9N6","Overall":"good","Content":"I was attracted to this product because of its very low price and a mail-in rebate.  I had been shopping for a traditional crt tv and had thought I was years away from getting a flat panel TV.While the price certainly attracted me, it was so much cheaper than the norm that I was concerned about quality.  I've had the device for a week now and am pleased to report that it appears to be very good.Although not quite High Definition, this LCD is of a higher resolution than most of the flat planels you may have seen in stores.  Its 800 x 600 resolution is so, so much better than the poor 640 x 480 res on most of the fore mentioned panels.  And it's half the price of most of those low res screens as well!I did not previously have alot of experience with LCD flat panels and didn't know if the screen's advertised response time was fast enough or the contrast high enough.  I can report that I see absolutely no image blur during the fastest scene changes.However, I would have liked a little more contrast.  If you increase brightness enough to see adequate detail in dark scenes, the true blacks become slightly greyish.  I find it a little annoying that the letter box areas are therefore grey - but not even close to being annoying enough to go back to an \"old fashioned\" TV.The image quality, after setting up unit with the included composite cord, was very nice.  However, after connecting my DVD player to this panel's COMPONENT inputs, the picture was great.  I found that I was actually getting the sensation of \"being on scene\" rather than just watching a piece of glass.  Note that this panel does not support progressive video, but the component cable improvement was well worth the cable investment anyway.Although the picture is better in a dark room, it can tolerate normal room lighting as well.  My display arrived with zero bad pixels.The tiny 5 watt speakers were surprising clear and pleasant.  The panel surround is well designed, appears to be well built, and looks good.  The remote is surprisingly bulky especially when pared with such a sleek machine, but is easy to use and has equal range to any sony remote I have.I have some concern over not really knowing anything about this manufacturer or their reliability, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase at the moment.  I know of no better way to get into flat panel, or a similiar quality product at even twice my price.","Date":"January 3, 2005"}

Everything works as expected. Picture quality is good but not excellent andis reasonable for its price.I seemed to have a really poor IR receiver module in the LCD.

And, my old NEC TV, though farther and almost at 90 degree angle from the remote, kept turning on and off while the syntax LCD was ignoring the keys. I called Syntax Tech support, and he told me that the IR module is probably defective. They will send a new one to me and send some technician over to replace it. Hopefully it will work fine after that. Will follow up with this post.To Tak Leung, who had previous post about the TV turning itselfoff after an hour or so, while browsing the setups, I saw sleep control where the TV would turn it self OFF after the timer expires.

I downsized from a 27\" standard tube TV to the 20\" Syntax Olevia.  The setting is a built in bookshelf unit in a library size living room.  My old \"big black box\" TV was dominating the space and overwhelming my collection of books as well as the entire room.  The 20\" Olevia vastly improved the aesthetics of the space.  It was not a bad transition for me because I have a 46\" widescreen HDTV in the basement for games, PS2 and movies.The picture quality is great, although it does look a little grainy from about 2' away.  The ideal viewing distance would be about 10 feet or so.  I use a standard S-video hook up to DTV receiver and it looks great.  I find the colors to be very crisp and clear. As others have pointed out, there is a little adjustment period for getting your settings to the ideal level.  There is a tendency to have a lot of whites or too much darkness without the right settings.  Once you find a good level, it is fine after that.The cons are that the volume is a little on the loud side even at the lowest setting, but not a big deal.  I have not been able to find the codes to program a universal remote yet.  So having to use the extra remote for on/off, and volume is a little annoying.The pros:It sure was nice to carry a TV that did not weigh a ton into the house!The quality of the picture for watching general programming is just great.I happen to love the design. Very sleek without looking flimsy.The price was definitely right.If you are looking for a low priced alternative to your standard TV, this is the one.  The 20\" TV can be had for less than other 15\" or even 13\" LCD TV's.  I am all about value, and if you are too, I would seriously take a look at this product.","Date":"April 26, 2005"}

The ease of use and the quality of the sound and picture is staggering. I only wish I had bought a larger version. With what they say about the side to side problems in LCD tv's this one shows none of the degridation discribed in reviews of most of them. The sound is crisp and the tones, which are adjustable, are superb for the size of the speaker units that are detatchable. I highly recomend this tv.

{"Title":"Good value for DVD watching","Author":"John Clement","ReviewID":"RZAWUKV5CLI9A","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olevia LT27 series are all an excellent value with a better picture than all of the competitors in this price range.  The picture on a good DVD is excellent.However there are two problems when they are used as a computer monitor, or when watching letterboxed movies.  All of the Olevia products have 3 aspect ratio modes: widescreen, 4:3, and zoom.  The widescreen can be used with a DVD player set to widescreen for a very detailed excellent picture.  The 4:3 is just the ticket for normal TV viewing.  But the zoom mode enlarges a widescreen picture, not on the 4:3 picture.  As such it is only useful for filling the screen when watching a DVD which is letterboxed even when watched in widescreen.  Unfortunately it cuts off the sides of the screen.  There is no mode for watching letterboxed normal TV or tape presentations.  The owner's manual shows a picture which indicates that zoom is to be used with letterboxed movies, as it shows the 4:3 picture enlarged to fit the full width with no distortion in the aspect.  It is not suitable for this purpose because it both cuts off part of the picture and widens the picture to make everyone look fat.  When contacted the Olevia support denied that the mode was incorrect and would not compare the manual to the actual performance.  This problem appears in all Olevia LCD TVs.(...)The only other complaint could be the remote/control options.  It would be desirable to have some frequently changed functions such as the aspect ratio as a separate button, or better yet the aspect could be automaticaly changed with the source so that the DVD input automatically goes into widescreen mode while the AV or TV input is in 4:3.  The input designations are a bit cryptic for the average user, and the menu layout is sometimes frustrating.In all I would rate this as an excellent value, but not for the person who will watch mainly letterboxed conventional tapes/TV.  A little attention to the remote control issues, lack of a driver, and the addition of a letterbox mode would go a long way toward making this the ideal solution for the person who wants a 27 inch widescreen TV without buying a backbreaking bulky CRT set.  The best of all worlds would be for Syntax to make available a firmware upgrade to fix some of these issues.","Date":"July 30, 2005"}

{"Title":"Important Defect: Zoom, so 27","Author":"Matthew Elvey \"tech whiz\"","ReviewID":"R382Q88DKL34W0","Overall":"good","Content":"<UPDATE>: Would like to re-rate at 5 stars (but can't).I called my cable company (comcast) and asked if there was a way to zoom with the cable box.  They said no, but I pressed on, saying that the installer had done something to bring up a menu. I was told that pressing power (off) and then menu brought up a menu, in which I changed a setting, (the 3rd one - 4:3 off) and now the Olevia's zoom works properly!More info, making this a comprehensive review:I got mine from Amazon, and just got my (...) (we gotta buy stuff from Amazon to show our support for cool features like the reviews. Amazon's reviews were helpful, and they're good netizens, so I didn't wanna screw 'em; thank you fatwallet for informing me of this great TV!) I made the delivery guy wait while I unpacked and inspected it, as Amazon refuses returns of 27\"+ TVs.Issues:1)Quite Grainy with standard TV quality signal (good otherwise), but if I turn the sharpness to 0 and the noise reduction to high, it's OK (but there are annoying side effects of this solution - the picture becomes cartoony, and the noise reduction option is disabled on component video in, which I mostly use!)2)channels: I had a regular TV plugged into cable, and it got ~80 channels. The Olevia was only able to display channels up to channel 31, 'till I figured out that I needeed to switch it from TV to CATV mode.3)PIP - was confusing to get working -The UI(User Interface) of the remote is weird - e.g. with many remote UIs, there's a consistent way to select something. In this TV's UI, to select something,1)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit menu to exit,2)sometimes you move the cursor to it and hit enter,3)sometimes you just move the cursor to it and hit the <right/volume up> button.For PIP, you have to use method 3).I tried to resolve these issues:1-888-Syntax8 (1-888-796-8298),Tech:2 - no answer - tried 2x, then got through and they were helpful.Oddly, their FAQ suggests 1280x768 resolution, while 1280x720 is better IMO (perhaps because it's hard to set up a computer to run at that resolution-I used EnTech's PowerStrip software, which is great!)  I can hook up my 14\" iBook too, but can't customize the resolution, so I see 1024x768, which looks very good anyway.Mine has one dead pixel, which is in the corner and only the blue part of the pixel is defective, and it is always dark, so I don't care. It's hard to find w/o displaying a static blue image. The picture is bright and contrasty, as the impressive specs made me expect.</UPDATE>Lots of great reviews, but here's some key missing info:Review the 3 customer images I uploaded.Zoom mode is defective - instead of being straight zoom it's zoom+extra horizontal stretch, which is not very useful.  Instead of simply zooming in on a letterbox image, it distorts it as well, cutting off the sides and making the image look unnatural.  So for stuff shot in HD, but broadcast in regular NTSC format (which I expect will be an increasing proportion of programming for several years - until everything is HD) I end up viewing a 20\" image on my 27\" TV!!!Newer episodes of The West Wing and a few other major shows are like this, ESPN is mostly like this, etc.I spoke to Syntax support and emailed them, and spoke to management, but they said sorry, they see the problem but won't fix it.  I'll updateD this review.Support was helpful in getting PIP and CATV working right.Otherwise, it would be (IS) a 5-star.","Date":"March 6, 2005"}

When we purchased it, it was half the price of the Samsungs and Sonys of the same size and the picture looked better! Its a 720p and the eye can't tell the difference of 1080p until you get to 37\". It doesn't have as many inputs as today's TVs do, it only has a DVI input, not an HDMI and 2 component inputs (one HD and one 480p) as well as a cable input. I've used a PS3 with it as well as a Dish HD receiver. When we had cable, I used a splitter and connected one input to the HD component inputs and another to the cable and thus enabled its picture-in-a-picture function. The picture is vivid and sharp. If you can find one of these gems, I recommend buying it for a small room or bedroom.","Date":"February 18, 2010"}

Blacks are a little off, but not bad.Sound is terrible.  Throw out speakers as soon as you get this TV, they are worthless.  I think that is the reason they made them detachable.  If you try and hook up an satalite speakers threw the audio, they will not work.  An additional self powered subwoofer may work, I did not try it.Also, keep in mind that you need to get a HD tuner in order to watch TV in HD.  If you have DirecTV, that means $500 - $900 more for their equipment (at this time, prices will drop).Watching DirecTV without an HD reciever looks like taking a small JPEG and zooming in on it.  Not very good.  But some channels and programs look better than others.Remember, the DVDs look great and will look even better with an HD DVD player hooked up via DVI.  For almost as much as the TV, you can get DirecTVs HD equipment - but that will only make HD shows look better.  All the other channels will still look like a blown up JPEG.","Date":"August 8, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good TV - Monitor","Author":"ama2001","ReviewID":"RXWL54LTUNGAS","Overall":"good","Content":"I received my Olevia 30\" TV approx. 2 weeks ago.  It is in the bedroom, and used as both a TV and as a computer monitor.The TV performance is very good.  Hooked up to cable (RCN).  Can really see difference in broadcast quality (those stations broadcasting regular/cable and those using HD).  [Hopefully, won't have to get HDTV converter - what's televising now is very, very good.]  Have on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  View TV from 13feet - picture size comfortable.  Also, the remote works fine from 13feet away. [remote model RC-LTS]As a computer monitor - PERFECT.  Use VGA at 1024x768 resolution, display DPI=normal (96dpi).  Set on 4:3 ratio rather than widescreen (viewing in widescreen makes the picture stretched and fat).  This gives a viewable screen size of 25inches.  I can comfortably sit at the desk with the TV approx. 24inches from my face and work at the computer.  NO MORE HORIZONTAL SCROLLING!!!  Also, to do picture adjustment (menu - picture - auto adjustment - press volume up key) ---> use remote.Did try to use the DVI cable (from a previous monitor) - but only worked sometimes.  Don't know what the problem is, and cannot have both VGA and DVI cables attached - nothing displays - blank blue screen.  Since I can't visually tell difference between VGA and DVI performance, VGA cable connect fine.Easier to change SOURCE using remote [source - channel up or down key to select - press volume up key finish].  For some reason cannot use keys on TV directly to change SOURCE [correction - can use but cumbersome].  This is the one inconvenience to this system.Because I wanted a device that could be used as both a TV and as a computer monitor, this was the perfect choice.  I have used Sony VAIO entertainment computers since 1997, so I've had that dual ability - but I had to have the computer on in order to watch TV - now I don't.To have a decent viewable screen (25inches on a 30inch TV); to have the capability of viewing TV without having to turn on the computer; to have a decent computer monitor - THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.  I think it is well worth the cost.[...]","Date":"April 2, 2005"}

Got onto Amazon's website (in CompUSA) and read some of the reviews . I bought it right there and then. Picture quality with standard cable is good. I connected it to the three different DVD players in my home via the component input. All are progressive scan DVD players. Picture quality is only acceptable. Also, I had to turn the \"blue gain\" way down. There seem to be a slight blue tinge on my unit. I've seen the models from Sony and Sharp and I did not expect that kind of quality output, but I am a bit disappointed. Picture is not clear, blacks look more like dark blues.I haven't tried it with a DVI output DVD player, but did hook it up to my computer to see if there is any difference in the quality of picture from a DVD. There was none. I'm wondering if my unit is defective? I think I'll pack it up and exchange it to see if I get better results....Update: Well, I got a replacement unit and added a Samsung DVI upconverter DVD player. Quality is Excellent! Folks, the Component inputs on this TV is crap, if you want a very good picture you have to get a DVD player with a DVI interface. I'll be getting the 30\" soon. Also, I've noticed that my unit hangs, but this rarely happens. I have to power it off to get any response from the unit. Other than this, I've got not complaints. It was money well spent.

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. <br /><br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player & computer). <br /><br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.<br /><br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. <br /><br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. <br /><br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P<br /><br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. <br /><br />But if you want to find out some more, or see more pictures. Go check out my profile at [...] . My username is virebelrus .

Used almost exclusively as a computer monitor and xbox monitor.  Great for xbox using progressive component.  For the most part very good for computer using vga and 1280x720 with ATI Radeon Video.  Ran into huge problem when I upgraded my video card to Nvidia 6600gt.  Although the card says it supports 1280x720 the picture looks like it is running at a non-native resolution. (very blurry similar to running at a resolution other then 1280x720).  As far as the tv side, the picture quality is horrible using the standard catv inputs on the back.  I have not tried hooking this up to a hdtv decoder or satalite but would assume those would look very nice given the quality of the xbox signal.

{"Title":"Great, second-tier LCD TV even after 10 years...","Author":"CriticalEye","ReviewID":"RQO9YRLU4GXZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased a Syntax LT30HV nearly 10 years ago for approximately $1,300.  It's been used regularly for the past 10 years with no issues at all.  This is an early LCD TV that was modeled after the top-ranked Sharp Aquos models of the same vintage (about 2003-2004).  The speakers are detachable and any other stereo speakers may be directly connected to this TV in their place.  The 720p image is extremely sharp as noted by other reviewers.  The image driven from a laptop or computer via the DVI port is equally sharp.  Just amazing, really.  Standard definition channels are hit or miss, but are generally acceptable.Comparing 10 year old flat-panel TVs to new ones, is interesting.  The Syntax feels like a tank, very well made and very heavy, while new TV's feel flimsy and light.  Of course, new ones are a fraction of the cost (about one tenth), the picture is higher resolution and multiple HDMI ports are available.  Just the Syntax carton is a work of art, a double box design mad from high-quality cardboard.I had a Roku 2 XS hooked up to it for a while using just the analog inputs and it looked fine.  On a whim, I purchased an HDMI to DVI adapter via eBay for $2 and connected the Roku's HDMI output to the Syntax DVI with the adapter.  Wow!  A nice crisp 720p image.  Sound does not travel over DVI, so I also hooked up an audio cable between the Roku's analog out and the audio in on the Syntax.  Success!  The Roku apparently (and thankfully) outputs simultaneously via both the analog and HDMI ports.The worst thing that I can report is that via the remote, source switching is overly complicated.Wrapping up, this had been a really nice TV and it will continue to be used in a guest bedroom.","Date":"February 2, 2014"}

all LCDs.  We have had no other problems with one exception.  The tvs are very sensitive to low signal level.  At 1080i - it doesn't like component switches or direct connects from the PS3.  It cuts out and fritzs.  I have a video of this I will try to upload.I would also like to know if other people have firmware upgrades past the initial one that allowed the tv's to work with scientific atlanta remote controls???Michael","Date":"July 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"Excellent Value","Author":"Sandy","ReviewID":"R12IJBY6FT9Y2L","Overall":"good","Content":"I didn't want to spend alot for a flat panel tv and I didn't want a glorified comptuer monitor either.  So, I found this 20\" model for $399 and did some research, read the reviews and comparison shopped.I have to say, I LOVE MY TV.  I took it off the stand and leaned it against the wall on a shallow shelf and hooked it up to my DirecTV cable.The GREAT things about this tv are:Price, quality, durability, size, 4 different sets of inputs, can be used as a computer monitor and it looks good 'in person.'The OKAY things are:The remote is sort of simple;When viewing dark scenes, i.e. nighttime, dark clothing (black, dark blues, deep reds...), there is a 'shadow' that I haven't figured out how to lighten - using Brightness and adjusting the screen to Light didn't do the trick. To alleviate this, you have to be level from the tv.  If the tv is above your line of sight or you try to watch it from the side, you get the shadow.If you don't want to mortgage the house to get into the flat panel market, this tv is an excellent purchase to that end.","Date":"August 12, 2005"}

I plugged it in, hooked up my regular cable connection, turned it on and fell in love!I had extensively researched both LCD and Plasma TVs and this model has exceeded my wildest dreams in every way, and I haven't even taken the time to try out all the features.  The price was unbeatable...I ordered from Target, got 10% off and free shipping.  The delivered price (excluding state tax) was $1,259.99, cheaper than I had seen anywhere for a 30\" LCD TV. I bought it for my bedroom and quickly realized that a bigger screen would have been TOO BIG.  Unless you are into really massive screens, this size would fit in nicely in any living room.I just have regular cable..not digital or HDTV and the colors and sharpness are unbelievable.  I could easily have spent twice as much on another brand and I can't imagine the image being any better.  I can't say too many good things about this TV.My ONLY complaint?  The alarm feature doesn't give you the option of what channel comes on..just whatever the last channel you were watching.  I can't wait until this weekend so I can really study the manual and learn how to use all the great features.Way to go Syntax!!!!! I'm telling all my friends!","Date":"January 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Cheap HDTV LCD","Author":"Richard","ReviewID":"R1X9MTPGU9DPWZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the market for a bedroom tv and decided that it had to be at least a high def monitor.  Also after lugging around too many tubes, I decided it must be something light like a LCD high def monitor.  After looking at reviews and PRICES, I decided to purchase the LT27HV for $700 after rebate.  Here's my list of PROs and CONs:PROs:1.  Relatively inexpensive for a high def LCD.2.  Plenty of inputs.3.  Relatively light and compact.CONs:1.  Remote is horrible (especially what you must endure to  change the video source).2.  Remote codes are not readily available.  I was able to  control the power and volume with some research on my  directv remote and that's it.3.  Picture quality is fair and picture tuning is very difficult4.  Changing the picture size (i.e. 16:9 versus 4:3 versus 4:3  stretched) is awkward.If you are in the market for a cheap high def LCD now, then you cannot beat the price of the LT27HV.  I haven't seen anything cheaper or remotely close in price yet.  If you can wait a few months, I would not recommend purchasing the LT27HV.  It's fair picture quality and operational burden are a royal pain.","Date":"July 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"Sounds like a crapshoot  LT27HV","Author":"Tom Urbanik \"2jaded2care\"","ReviewID":"R31MPVQ4JEEF4B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have taken the time to read almost 100 of these reviews good and bad, and some people get the lemons, some don't, and some may not even know they got a lemon.Although I did not get my Syntax LCD tv from Amazon, I have purchased other things like pots and pans.  From reading over 100 reviews, those are the best Amazon purchases.My Radio Shack purchase was disappointing when, like many of these reviews, the one dead pixel showed up in the middle of the screen.  RS representatives noted that all LCDS have dead pixels.  I won't say what I think about that.  Being smart to avoid a bipolar extravaganza on he RS showroom floor, they agreed to exchange the tv.  The second tv's screen arrived flawless.  I went to Amazon to read reviews before I called my cable company in regard to 3-  to 8-second blackouts occurring requently, and I realize now that it is the tv, and it is very, very, very annoying.  Did I say that it is annoying?  In the middle of programming, going to commercials, MUSIC VIDEOS.I give the product 3 stars because my meds help make the blackouts tolerable, picture quality is fine (in between blackouts), it works great with my pc, and sounds excellent hooked up to my own speakers (manufacturers speakers are on the porch).","Date":"October 26, 2005"}

{"Title":"Avoid Buying This Item From Amazon - but do buy it","Author":"Carl S. Curry","ReviewID":"R2UHZCYNI5DU8T","Overall":"good","Content":"AVOID BUYING THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.The TV itself is probably excellent. But unless you're home all the time to receive it, getting the shipment from UPS or getting a customer service response from Amazon is pure hassle.UPS had this item `out for delivery'. I took a day off and stayed in earshot of the door. Nothing. At 6am the following morning (this morning) I called UPS. They won't make the shipment available for me to pickup. The call center forwards two messages to the facility. But there's no point in attempting delivery. This shipment requires a signature. No one will be home to sign for it.So I drive to the UPS facility, knowing darn well this box is on a truck and they can pull it off. Which the agent at the counter does. But while I'm staring at the box, I get a call from UPS on my cell phone. Janet (UPS agent at the facility) says the shipment is out for delivery, sorry about that. In other words, she doesn't feel like going and getting the box to put in will call. I am not making this up. And it gets worse.While all this nonsense is transpiring, I examine the box closely (it's good and beat up) and see that it is a LT27, NOT the LT30 that I paid for. So after all this, I have to refuse the shipment because it is the wrong merchandise from Amazon.For Amazon's part, like others have commented, there is no real customer service. I dug around clicking and looking. You can send an email. Obviously customer service is not one of their strengths.My unit will go back undelivered, despite my efforts to retrieve it myself. Amazon, eventually, I assume, will credit me for the failed order fulfillment. Eventually.Now I'm looking to buy the Olevia elsewhere, as I definitely still want it. Somewhere with a customer service phone number. And who ships FedEx.*******UPDATE*******There are plenty of places to buy this unit with good customer service and who ship FedEx. The folks at IBuy Digital called me (not me trying in vain to reach them) to verify information about the order. And as always, FedEx was right on schedule. I can just about set my clock by these guys.Important points about the LCD buyers may value, in no particular order.If using as a monitor, you need a deep workspace. I had to rework mine. The minimum comfortable distance for me with this LCD is more than 4 feet. Most desks aren't that deep.Resolution and refresh are critical. I settled on 1280x960 at 60Hz. I also found a ClearType Tuner power tool to finesse the text to be as clear as possible.I am using a 2PC KVM, with just a VGA connection to the Olevia. With resolutions and refresh set the same, the only issue is sometimes switching back and forth the Olevia sets brightness and contrast back to defaults. It takes 10 seconds to fix.I have a PC attached to the Olevia with an ATI All In Wonder. Easylook Media Center with remote is a nice way to use this unit.Text is OK. My wife thinks detailed graphics work might be difficult. I will probably try it anyway. Games look fantastic.Composite video and DVD from a PC also look fantastic. Analog TV shows itself for what it is, crap. This is something that goes unnoticed until you directly A-B analog TV with composite DVD video. I will switch to HDTV immediately. Which brings up PIP. This unit has true dual NTSC tuners, which is true PIP. But for HDTV, you still need a set top HDTV box from the cable company. So there's a compromise in there.There's also a limitation with split screen and PIP. Inputs are in 'groups', so you can't always get the combination you want.I'm having no trouble with the remote. But I'm always in proximity to the LCD. As others have commented, you have to use the right arrow key in lot of settings where Enter makes more sense. It's stupid, but you just get used to it.Overall, you will get immediately spoiled with one of these. The dual 19's at my mixing console suddenly look a little small. Did I mention games and video look fantastic?","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

I am currently using it as a monitor for my new computer I am have built. Playing DVD off of my computer is a lot clearer than playing DVD off my DVD player since there were less noise in the connection. The monitor is extremely bright, I had to turn down the brightness to about 9/100. When I have recieved it I had one retarded light black/white pixel, not noticeable and pretty good when it comes to a lcd this big. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />This monitor comes with DVI, VGA, S-Video, Cable, and other ports for progressive scan and surround sounds. When I plug my monitor into the VGA port of my computer, the monitor automatically adjusts and resizes to the right 16:9 view. You can pic full screen or 16:9. Other options which I find very kewl about this monitor is that it has picture in picture option. Plus also the dual monitor options comes in handy. I can have one computer plugged into the VGA and the other computer plugged into the s-video (or DVD player &amp; computer). &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Another thing for parents. It also have a parental control for password. I have not use this function yet, since I dont have kids. Hehehe.&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Putting my hand near the monitor, it does give out some heat, although not as much radiation as tv and crt. The speakers on the sides do give out a little very high frequency that is not so audible. I can take them off, but these speakers are pretty well performers. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />The monitor comes in a very big box, I don't think it can fit in my honda civic unless I fold back the sits. It is a good thing that shipping is free. It is well packaged. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Taking the monitor out, I am surprise to see that the monitor is so beautiful... ;P&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />Image quality is terrific. Sharp and clean. One downside is that the remote control is tragically weak. I heard that games are great on these monitor, but I have not try it yet. Afraid I might get too addicted to it. &#60;br /&#62;<br />","Date":"December 10, 2004"}

In fact, many experts (including Consumer Reports) assert that high-definition TVs using traditional cathode-ray tube technology -- as this high-definition Sony does -- currently offer a sharper picture than plasma and LCD TVs, plus they are much less expensive and more reliable. This widescreen HD Sony TV has a very good picture with standard broadcasts and an outstanding picture with HD broadcasts and DVDs. If you'd like to get a widescreen high-definition TV now but your budget is limited to a thousand dollars or so, please consider this 30\" Sony.","Date":"December 27, 2004"}
{"Title":"Exceptional TV for the price","Author":"Hammad Malik","ReviewID":"R1LCX4OY64BSUN","Overall":"good","Content":"This model (along with its 34 inch sibling) was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports in traditional TV widescreen HD category. I have it plugged into my Cablevision service for HD signal - the step up in picture quality compared to standard signal is quite noticeable. But the good thing is that even standard TV transmission (non HD) produces very good picture on this TV (which was a factor in its best buy choice by Consumer Reports). The TV has plenty of video inputs of all kinds, including 2 component video and 1 HDMI.I have my Panasonic S97 DVD player hooked up to this TV via HDMI input and this allows my Panasonic DVD player to upconvert DVD's to 1080i so I can watch them as clear as the HD TV. Granted that the DVD upconvert to 1080i is a Panasonic DVD player feature but you can't use it without having HDMI input on the TV.According to the Consumer Reports review of HD TV's, most HD TV's produce great picture with the HD signal but the picture quality is not so good with standard TV signal. Since most of the programming on TV continues to be transmitted via the standard signal, this TV's very good performance with the standard TV signal was a big factor in my buying decision.","Date":"March 24, 2005"}

{"Title":"Fabulous Picture Quality!","Author":"Booksnoop","ReviewID":"R3LIR8JFSWMM8H","Overall":"good","Content":"We have needed a new tv for quite some time (our 14 year old Hitachi set was failing), and after doing research on the different types of tvs available, plasma vs LCD vs conventional set, I decided to go with a conventional set, which delivers the best picture for the least amount of money.I chose Sony's KV-30HS420 widescreen high definition tv after looking at a number of tvs in the store and reading reviews (it recently got a great rating in the March 2005 issue of Consumer Reports).I could have saved about $60 on the set buying on Amazon rather than locally, but decided not to in case there were any problems with the set and also I would have to wait at least a week to receive it.  Be warned that if this is your first HD tv, you will probably need to spend about $150 buying new cables to take advantage of the HD features when you hook up your dvd player and cable box to the tv.  I bought two sets of Monster brand cables for my Comcast DVR cable box and my dvd player.This tv is HEAVY!  My husband and I managed to carry this down steps from our driveway into the house and then down a flight of steps into our basement tv room, but that's only because he's very strong.  You really need at least 2 strong people to carry this.  If you buy locally and can't find help, it would be worth it to pay for delivery and set up.We did have some problems hooking up our cable box to the tv, as Sony's directions are not clear, but we finally got everything working. We have Comcast digital cable and receive a number of HD broadcasts and the picture quality is unbelievable!  Our dvds look equally as great.If you are considering a new tv, I would highly recommend this model.","Date":"June 25, 2005"}

Not that plasma is bad but having to pay $250 for the light bulb every 4000 to 6000 hours! No thanks. And Plasma TV aren't that afortable yet.I'm a movie freak and a gamer.

All my DVDs are in widescreen format and I'm finally getting to watch them how they are meant to be watched!Edit: October 19th, 2006After now almost 2 years, I had to get my TV calibrated mostly because of recommendations to get the the best Picture I could get out of this TV. I regret I didn't do this earlier. The picture was great but now it is just plain fantastic. Red push is gone, overscan corrected, picture Sharper than it was, the Black level is phenomenal, I saw details in movie that I never knew they were there. The overall PQ improved. Dvds running at 720p or 1080i are fantastic thanks to the upconversion of my DVD player.The only downside of this set I own is the little bowing on the corners.

Even though only a few games support THAT resolution, my console games look really good in 480p. There is such a big difference in picture quality...it's astounding. The major reason though is that the next gen consoles will support HD as well, with all games running in at least 720p. Can't wait for that.Cable looks great as well. Channels that are 1080i in widescreen are freaking increadible. Normal channels...so-so. Sometimes they look pretty good, but the picture is a bit on the grainy side.This is a great HDTV. Even though the price is a  bit steep, I think it's well worth it. Remember to buy component cables to watch tv and other devices in high def.

{"Title":"Beauty and Beast","Author":"Jeco","ReviewID":"R1SZ127AEOSFTG","Overall":"good","Content":"Beauty - I bought the Wega off Craigslist for $300 in 2008.  We were not in the HD upgrade market, we just needed a TV since our 27\" Sony Trinitron took on a little lightning.  Being a huge fan of Sony's TVs from years past I was only searching the terms \"Sony TV\".  I didn't even know the Wega was widescreen or HD until I went to the sellers house to see it. He was watching the World Series in HD. He was actually pretty upset that I had money and a truck with me, and he was going to have listen to the rest of the game on the radio.  I think if it weren't for his wife being there I would have left with no TV.I didn't have any HD content to dazzle my wife with at home so I put on a Pixar DVD, Monsters Inc. Even with the signal fed through S-Video, we were both blown away by the improved detail in picture quality. You could actually count Sully's hairs if you were half insane or Rain Man.  But they were all there, all 4,987,653 of them.Since it was HD (1080i), we (my wife) didn't have an excuse to not have a BluRay player anymore, so we (I) decided to get a Sony BluRay to move us into the new era of our life (on the couch).  BluRays look spectacular! We still only get SD from our satellite system, but even that looks fantastic.  This past Christmas (2011) we added an xBox to our family and I'm still blown away by the picture quality.  Baring any more lightning, I expect to have the Wega for many more years.Beast - The Wega weighs slightly less than my house.  I often wonder if the slathering of good reviews of these TVs are written by people (like me) who don't want to come to terms with the fact that someday they will have to move this thing again.  I am holding out hope that when it finally dies, it just turns to dust and we can sweep it up and sprinkle it over the garden and grow some HD vegetables in the next season.","Date":"March 1, 2012"}

Everyone thought it was stupid and a waste of money to buy a CRT HDTV, but they quickly shut up after seeing the picture quality.  They then thought it would die after a year of use... it hasn't.The picture quality of the set is truly excellent, especially when watching a good Bluray disc.  The speakers are loud and have plenty of bass (something all flat panels lack imo) and I've never noticed any sort of lag, wether playing video games on xbox 360 or watching a high paced movie.  I use my TV a lot, and often leave it on while I'm using my computer for hours, it's still performing excellently.Recently it has started to show some artifacts and \"fuzz\" along the middle lines of the screen, but only when the screen is pure black (I only notice it when it's not receiving a signal).  I'm finally going to upgrade to a Plasma this year, but only because this screen is too small for me, that's literally the only drawback.  I'm keeping this TV as an extra set in another room and if it keeps on being as reliable as it has been, I expect to own it for many years to come!If you find one of these gems for sale on your local craigslist and need a nice HD set for next to nothing, don't hesitate to pick one up!","Date":"April 12, 2011"}

Mena","ReviewID":"R340SDG6HS4JQ0","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all I want to say that Im a filmmaker and know about TV and film quite a lot so I know what Im talking about. Anyone that knows about TV's knows that CRT/picture-tube TV's (the fat ones) will produce superior image quality than any comprable LCD monitor. Just because a TV is thin and flat does not mean that it will produce a better image quality. Thin TV's are all the rage right now but what trully should matter is the picture quality. My Sony 30\" widescreen HDTV's image quality is awsome. I've had it for about a year now and have been very, very, happy with it. Yes, it is super bulky and heavy but it fits in the corner of my bedroom quite well and its picture tube is super flat. Plus, the design of the TV makes it look a lot thinner than it really is. I've had to point out to guests that my TV is not a thin TV. The other cool thing about CRT HDTV monitors are that they cost about 40% less than flat LCD or plasma TV's. And like I said before, LCD will not give the same picture quality as CRT's. Plasma TV's do compare to CRT's but they cost a lot more and unlike CRT's you don't have recharge the chemicals like you do in plasmas after about 3000 hours of viewing time. Plus, I got my TV as a brand new clearance item at Fry's for $600! Trust me, I did a lot of research and this model had it all. About the only thing I wish it had was a third HDMI input and the capacity to broadcast at 1080p.","Date":"February 20, 2007"}

But in comparison, I only watch my 18 year old 27\" TV a couple of hours a day, and I don't entertain with it on, so dropping $3K on a new set made no sense. I remember seeing the prototype of the Sony widescreen HD CRT sets in Tokyo in 1989, about $15K at the time, and I promised myself I would own one, once the price dropped. And voila! Almost 20 years later, my dream has come true. So can yours, if you can live with the difference in size, picture quality, and energy consumption. Yes, it's quite a bit deeper, but if you are replacing an old CRT, like mine (which died yesterday), you probably won't mind. As you already know, besides the Kuro, no LCD nor plasma is going to give you the detail and contrast (blacks) that a CRT will. And the thing nobody ever talks about is that CRTs will consume much less power than either LCD or plasma. The late model Wegas all come HDMI ready, which is required for all the upgrades coming with digital television broadcast next year, and though this 30\" Sony will not achieve 1080p, it doesn't have to, because that resolution is wasted on any screen smaller than 50\", a fact nobody here seems to acknowledge. I would go so far as to say, if you are not a film maker, you are wasting your time worrying about anything higher than 720p, which this set achieves. Still want to spend $900 at Costco or Best Buy for a comparable plasma? I bought my tv from a gamer who fell hard for his $4K Kuro, and sold his 1 year old Sony to me for...$180! I could have gotten the top of the line 36\"XBR widescreen with matching stand for $450 used, but the point is, if you are looking for a bargain basement HDTV deal, for less than the price of a new Blueray DVD player, now is the time. Once you hook up that new HD DVD player, you'll forget all about that wall mount.","Date":"June 10, 2008"}

This is not a knock on this model, only a general comment--getting a product like this into the house and getting it to work is a cumbersome process.

I tried and returned two other 34inch widescreen models prior to settling on this phillips 34pw8402. The standard def picture quality is really good on this set, noticeably better than most HDTV sets. Often times HDTV sets do a poor job with regular def signals, after having experienced this on my first two tries, I was thrilled when I saw what this set could do with a regular signal. Regular TV just looks great, the colors especially...I believe this set's strength with regular signals comes from its \"active control2\" capabilities, and some enhanced digital video processing features incorporated into this set.  Now for HDTV signals and progressive scan DVD, this set gives a positively spectacular image!! Don't be fooled by the age and size of CRT technology. Trust me, it does exceedingly well with HDTV signals, and rivals, (and in my opinion) mostly surpasses the image you get from $3000-5000 Plasma and LCDs. My 34pw8402 HDTV signal is visibly better than my brother's $5000 Panasonic plasma.  Anyways, back to the set, the HDTV image is just wonderful, and often times eerily realistic. Nature shows are mind boggling, and sports, particularly Football, is just jaw dropping gorgeous.  Finally, for DVD's you will be more than impressed as well, I have this set hooked up to a computer and I \"upscale\" DVD's to 1920x1080i resolution, and the end effect is incredible. It really has a 3d effect, and you can see tremendous depth and detail to any well filmed movie. With this TV, you will re-experience your favorite movies all over again, and you will find yourself watching more DVD's than you ever thought you would.  I really don't have any complaints with this set, from the inputs, to sound, to form factor, ect..Everything is perfect, or very nearly so.  One more thing, this set has the new HDMI digital standard hookup, and I wasn't too concerned with this going in, but as it turns out, when I did buy an hdmi cable...and switched my DirecTV HDTV hookup from RGB component to hdmi...there was some real significant image quality improvement. I wasn't expecting much, but I'd say it gave a 25% improvement to an HDTV image that I thought could not get any better. So, if you can, get an HDTV that has the new hdmi. This would be prudent anyways, since this is the new standard, and all new HDTV's, plasmas ect, are incorporating it. In summary, this Phillips is a 5 STAR SET, both  for HDTV, and regular content. It's also a fantastic buy in comparison to the competition, particularly the  Sony and Toshiba 34\" models, which are considerably more.  I like both of those sets, but if price was no issue, I would have gotten this Phillips again, I'm that pleased with it.","Date":"November 12, 2004"}

The DVD could read a dirty, scratched disc beyond the menu and minutes into the show. There is a VHS \"Rental\" feature to improve the quality of rented videos. The One-touch VCR recording is only controlled from the TV set itself (not the remote). There is no \"Previous Channel\" button on the remote, but you'll be using your cable/satellite remote anyway. Only 50 lbs., less than similar TVs from Insignia, Sylvania, Panasonic and Toshiba. Right out of the box, the black levels looked like they needed a boost, but overall the picture quality is great.Update 11/29/06:The only annoyance I've encountered is visible color banding during dark scenes or when the screen goes black. Adjusting the black level and contrast does not seem to help much. It's not a deal breaker.","Date":"June 1, 2006"}

We put it on our fireplace mantel, but we were a little concerned that it would be too high to see the picture.  Amazingly, the picture looks great, not only while sitting on the couch, but from any angle in the living room.  The picture never looks too dark either.  I watched The Matrix on it this morning and the picture was beautiful and I could see everything perfectly.The reason I didn't give this TV 5 stars, is because of the few things that are not included with the TV purchase:* TV does not come with a stand.  You are expected to either mount it on a wall or pay $180+ for the optional stand (which I did).* TV does not come with cables of any kind.  If you think you'll be able to twist in the cable TV cord into the back of the TV like on a regular TV, you can't.  On a basic cable box (which does not receive HD channels) you can connect using an S-video connection.  If you have an HD cable box, you can use the component video connection.  I did not feel like waiting for the cable company to bring out a new HD box, so I connected mine to the TV with the S-video and used the component video for my DVD player.* TV does not come with speakers.  You have to either purchase the optional speakers or you can use speakers you already have and connect them in the connections for the speaker wire.Nonetheless, it is a fantastic TV and I am very happy with my purchase.","Date":"December 4, 2004"}

Weisgal","ReviewID":"RV1AQLROKVXKF","Overall":"good","Content":"I feel as though most people make a purchase, and then justify it by raving about it's performance, even if in their heart of hearts they know it is junk.Just recently, an acquaintance of mine purchased an LCD television that, while asthetically pleasing, has one of the worst pictures I have seen.  Trail, ghosting, poor colors, etc...  DLP projection is simply the best picture you can buy if dollars spent VS. quality of picture is your goal. If you MUST hang a TV on a wall, KNOW that you MUST ALSO spend at least $7000 for a picture that begins to match the quality of a $2500 DLP.  The cheaper flat screens are cheaper for a reason.  You do the math.This Samsung model is just gorgeous.  HDTV is simply stunning.  Colors are crisp, black levels are INCREDIBLE, and the picture is 95% perfect right out of the box!  I had an engineer look at this set and say \"it is perfect when you plug it in\".  So many sets need \"tweaking\" for days before they look right, so this is an added benefit on this model.Also, the set has PIP, which can be used for watching TV while also using your computer!  Simply run video out from your computer and you have a 50 inch HD Monitor!!  Awsome!This set has HDMI, which no one really uses yet, but it is nice to have for the future.  For those who do not know, HDMI is ONE cable that carries HD PICTURE AND SURROUND SOUND.  It also has DVI input for the BEST HDTV picture available.The look (pedestal) is love it or leave it, but if you are here, you obviously find it pleasing.I can not comment on the sound as I have never used it (I have a home theater system), and this brings me to a slightly offpoint comment, but one that is important.  if you DO get a surround system, please do this television justice and do not buy some junky home theater in a box!  Sound is actually MORE impotant than picture in terms of a visceral experience, and you do yourself no service to buy this set, and then use garbage sound. Also, BOSE, while nice, is overpriced and simply silly.  DO RESEARCH, and find that no respected audio/videophile respects BOSE, when they know better can be had for less.Sorry...back to my review.  This set is wonderful.  You can use a nice open-air AV rack to complement it visually, and as far as gaming goes, XBOX in HD is fabulous!!!ONE NOTE ON DVD's.  this television has a native resolution of 720P  DVD's only have a maximum of 480P, and as a technology, DVD's are not that great, which is why HD DVD's will be out this year (DVD's that do 480p,720p,1080i,1080p ie. High Definition DVD's) Do not be disappointed if DVD's look a bit fuzzy, pixelated, whatever... they look that way on ALL HDTV's.  It is the DVD, not the TV.  Still, they look nice.Well, that's all.  You may want to wait until 1080 native resolution sets are available later this year, but mind you they come with a hefty price tag!  For now, this is THE set; and I say that not because I own it, but because it is true. Enjoy!TOP NOTES:PROS:Good ClarityGREAT BLACK LEVELSNice ContrastBEST COLOR ON THE MARKETIt is light...about 100lbs for a 50 Inch TV!!!!!CONS:Can't hang it on a wall (it IS only 11 inches deep)Pedestal not for everyone","Date":"January 5, 2005"}

Best of all, there is no service adjustments you have to do to make the picture quality improve, it's right out of the box top quality.

No signal delay issues with the X-Box.The only thing is that there's no where to put stuff, and when you look at the specs of the add-on shelving unit, it's much wider than the TV, .....  but I just got a glass/metal shelf to put next to it to put my cable-box, X-Box, DVD player on.","Date":"October 21, 2004"}

{"Title":"Ignorance","Author":"D. Berndt","ReviewID":"RJZU6O2AVWPLD","Overall":"good","Content":"You should rate products based on their quality not your ignorance.  \"HD ready\" is a term used in every store which means that it is capable of producing a HD quality picture when provided with a source (i.e. a HD tuner or HD cable box).  If it has \"integrated HD\" then you know it has a built in tuner.  Do some research before you bash a product and a company.This is an outtake from bestbuy's websiteWhat's meant by \"HD-Ready\"?Some HDTV sets on the market incorporate HD-capable displays coupled with a built-in HDTV tuner to receive over-the-air HD broadcasts (currently available only in certain markets, these broadcasts are becoming increasingly common as the 2006 digital-broadcast deadline approaches). Often referred to as integrated HDTVs, these models are indicated on the BestBuy.com Web site by the designation \"with Built-In HDTV Tuner.\"However, the vast majority of HD-capable TVs on the market are what's known as HD-ready TVs (or HDTV monitors) - high-definition displays, often including one or more built-in NTSC TV tuners for reception of conventional analog TV broadcasts, but which must be connected to a separate HD source in order to realize their full potential. Since most current HD content is delivered via satellite or cable systems rather that over-the-air, some consumers (especially those who reside in areas where over-the-air HD content is not yet available) consider an HD-ready set to be the best solution for their current and future needs. But to experience HD broadcasts (where available) right out of the box with no additional investment, a built-in HD tuner is the ticket.Like HD-ready models, integrated HDTVs generally provide exhaustive connectivity options, so you can always add cable or satellite sources as well to broaden your HD options. Conversely, over-the-air HD tuners are also available in stand-alone set-top boxes, often combined with cable and/or satellite reception capabilities. Obviously, there are lots of ways to achieve your desired HD viewing experience, so we advise you to weigh various factors (including cost, convenience, and content availability) before making your decision.","Date":"October 15, 2004"}

With the integral stand, your component (receiver, DVD Player, etc...) storage options are limited to the funky stand made for this TV.2.  Direct-access to the input ports doesn't work.  It makes programming a remote, especially the \"too smart for their own good\" Logitech remotes, extremely difficult.  Attempting any sort of programming to directly switch to the HDMI, DVI or other ports simply doesn't work.  You have to use the \"Cycle\" method, and that also fails most of the time.

I have an XBOX 360 hooked up with a component inputs and the games look spectacular.  Coupled with an elegant stand, it really makes the living room. One other bonus is the DVI and HDMI inputs for true digital picture and sound from higher end DVD and HD boxes, and input of computers.  Surfing the internet on 50\" couldn't be more fun.Downsides I would say are the heftiness of moving this TV and sound inputs.  Find a good spot and leave it there as it does have a glass bottom for the stand. It could use some digital sound inputs as well such as optical or coaxial.Other than that all you do is plug it in and go.  It looks perfect right out of the box.  It does not produce much heat at all which is also a benefit if you have it in a smaller room with many other a/v products attached.This TV has been the best a/v product purchase I have ever made.

IT IS ALSO A BEAUTIFUL TV, IT REALLY MAKES A STATEMENT WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

I had to have a board replaced in it which cost me a few hundred bucks but all in all this has been a great television. It has over 12,000 hours on it! The blacks on it have never been very good but the colors are outstanding. I almost wish it wasn't so good, that way it would make my decision to go buy a new set much easier. The design is awesome. I love the pedestal that it is on and also the side racks that came with it as special order.  It hooked up easily to my surround sound system.","Date":"October 7, 2013"}
{"Title":"Withstands the test of time","Author":"M. Clark \"Nerd Alert\"","ReviewID":"R3NR0ED9S4JILF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using the HLP5685W for almost ten years now and could not be more pleased with it. DLP technology is still commonly used in projectors, but DLP TVs have mostly disappeared. However, they have some significant advantages which have led to me keeping this set over purchasing an LED LCD or Plasma in recent years. In particular, the ability to replace the DLP bulb (and color wheel if needed) means that the TV can be kept as crisp and clear as it was when it was brand new even ten years later. I know from having other LCDs and Plasmas that this is not true for them.In 2004, when this set was released, it was the cutting edge. It has VGA, DVI, multiple component inputs, and a single HDMI port. It is not a \"smart TV\", because back then they didn't exist! But it has served me very well for watching sports, Blu-rays and playing videogames. It is also flanked by very high quality speakers--so good that I simply stopped using my 5.1 system because it wasn't worth it!The only drawback, in my opinion, is also one of the benefits. That sounds odd, but I'm speaking of the pedestal. If your system and area you'll have your TV in can accommodate the footprint of the pedestal, it's very convenient to have it so that you don't have to worry about buying a shelving unit or hanging it on the wall as you do with a flat TV. However, if you don't have space for it, that can be a problem. Make sure you have a good space for a TV like this.Anyway, even nearly a decade later, I still think this is a great TV. I just recently replaced the bulb and the picture is crisp and bright--I love it! I don't feel like they make 'em like this anymore. It feels like consumer electronics and TVs in general are not built to last this long these days. It's unfortunate, but makes me all the happier to own this model.","Date":"March 17, 2013"}

I paid over 3k for it at the time. I know the downside to all DLP/LCOS tv's is the lamp burning out, however 6 years later, mine is still going strong. My tv averages at least 4 hours of use per day. I play many PS3 games on it and watch HD movies like crazy. The picture is outstanding. I want to upgrade to a 1080P tv, however this thing keeps kicking, and I honestly can't picture a tv looking better. Maybe side by side I'd see the difference, however in my home it looks flawless. I even got the swivel stand made by JVC so I can easily face the tv towards my dining room when it's time to eat.  A couple pointers for those of you with bulb issues.  -Never turn the tv off by a switch or unplugging it. Always allow it proper shutdown time so that the bulb can be cooled off by a fan.  -Keep the tv at least 2-3 feet from the wall behind it. This allows proper air flow to keep the bulb cool, and makes it less likely for a dusty build up.  -DUST!! Dont let dust sit on your screen, or on the back. This will clog up the air vents, causing the bulb to get very hot and blow.  -Don't constantly turn your tv on and off. Repeatedly doing this will also shorten the life of the tv. Just like a regular bulb!I have more than gotten my moneys worth, and would gladly buy this tv again. Thanks JVC!!","Date":"June 2, 2010"}

Although those that have problems will likely complain quite readily.Being the second owner of my now 4yr old TV, I can say it's served me rather well this last couple of years without any problems at all.  The picture is still perfect and it is still more than capable of displaying the HD content given from any cable provider.However, because its 720P it can not display the full resolution of Blu-Ray... but that doesn't matter because unless you have superhuman vision you absolutely can not tell the difference at 10 feet away.  Honestly, I can't tell the difference at even 4' away, but like most people I don't have 100% perfect vision.  20/20 only indicates how sharp or clear your vision is at a distance.  Overall vision also includes peripheral awareness, eye coordination, depth perception, focusing ability and color vision. All things considered, the science and economics are in your favor to get a giant tv that is High Definition but not inhumanly high...and get one that has a reputation for quality and endurance.  This one has stood the test of at least 4yrs strong.Yes, TV bulbs do eventually have to be replaced, and a couple years ago there was a problem with a particular manufacturer of the bulbs for this model but that has long since been corrected.

I was totally stuck on my HDTV purchase - bought a used Sony 42B2 and sold it 2 weeks later because it had lousy blacks and was noisy noisy.  I was thrashing around trying to decide on a used CRT RP but worried about burn in and resale (as well as the simple bulk and viewing angle problems)  Finally a friend told me about this set which is available at goodguys in the stores in the SF bay area for $1999.  (oddly it's $2299 online and $2199 at bestbuy.).  For that price this is a great unit.  Blacks are rich, it's very bright, has a lot of excellent inputs (VGA & DVI as well as component and S-video) - computer output looks extreemely good.  SDTV is not great (but I had such high standards because the scaler in the 42B2 was really really good.)  Still deciding how much I like DVD output - sharp and contrasty but not smooth in the subtle tones - I have to do more tweaking before I want to say for sure how I feel about it.

I have it hooked up to my cable box, a DVD Player, and my Mac G4. As a TV it is great: a very good picture, and easy to move. The DVD's are excellent on it, although LCD does not show some types of pictures perfectly, including smoke, fast moving objects, and water, but it IS a great picture nonetheless. The main reason I bought it was for the PC Compatability, and My Mac G4 hooks up easily, and beats the hell out of even the largest Mac monitors which are all smaller (a lot) than this one.  I am still learning how to get a full 1080 i out of the unit, but other than that I really have no major complaints. The back of the TV and it's adjoining piece (about the size of a VCR) have too many large wires, and could have been made easier to understand, and with less clutter. The remote is large and bulky with a ridiculous extra compartment that should have just been made as part of the remotes face. The TV unit weighs about 50 lbs. and the extra unit weighs around 25 lbs.  All in all however, it is a fine device, worth the $3200.00 I paid for it through Amazon.com","Date":"January 24, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great picture. Great price. Space saver. Versatile.","Author":"35-year Technology Consumer \"8-tracks to 802.11\"","ReviewID":"R3DFLBYN0CJRL2","Overall":"good","Content":"After completing a basement renovation, we were ready for a big screen to watch New Years and January football games. The shopping and selection process for this was long and hard, and the high end of our budget range certainly included some plasmas and flat panel LCDs near (but mostly above) the price of this TV.If you are a technology consumer, you know the deal: early adopters of LCD and plasmas are going to take a beating as prices for these fall. These technologies are not yet mature, and there are lingering issues, such as burn-in with plasma, and the sheer expense of LCDs. This set offers an excellent value for the size while the super thin formats settle in the marketplace.The picture is astonishing, and even more if you are lucky enough to live in an area served by HDTV. Even though not a true flat panel, it is only 15 inches deep and weighs less than 60 pounds. Getting it where you want to sit will probably take two people, but once there, it can be moved for cabling access easily by one person.It has more input options than most of us could ever afford to populate.Its user guide is complete and clearly written. I give only a B+ to some of the on-screen menu options; not all of them are immediately intuitive. This is a minor complaint for a TV that delivers every bit of the picture quality that the Sony enjoys a reputation for (going back to the days of \"a Sony of my owny...\"Terrific TV, Makes me never want to leave home:-)","Date":"January 8, 2005"}
{"Title":"Stunning picture, and it won't break the bank.","Author":"Aram Vartian","ReviewID":"RVCPRI16TKJ9A","Overall":"good","Content":"I had been shopping for a new television for the better part of three months, and had gone from plasma to LCD and back, before finally settling on the Sony 42\" Grand WEGA HDTV projection LCD television. It is, hands down, the absolute best value for the money I could find.PICTURE CLARITYThe HDTV quality is simply amazing, even breathtaking. I have found myself watching 2-hour documentaries about the now defunct whaling industry in Croatia just for the fact that is was broadcast in HDTV. DVD quality is also quite good, and regular digital cable is also rather sharp (and while analog signals will be tolerable, they pale in comparison to the others). Video games are as crisp as they could be, and the television also works great as a secondary monitor (invest in a TV-out video card and a wireless keyboard/mouse, and your couch is now your new home office).LCD TVs still have some minor issues with either incredibly rapid movement and/or bright flashes of light. There is a small distortion; a pixilation that will briefly flash across the screen but it is at best a minor annoyance. Also, the blacks are not as black as they could/should be, so if you are watching a movie or program where the setting is very dark, there will be a slight glow around the black areas that can be a little annoying.The short of it is this; if you are in any way normal, you will be blown away by the clarity and intensity of the images this set can produce. If you are a TV snob (and you know who you are), and could rant for ten minutes about the red push, or how optical audio out only passes digital signals via the tuner, then you may have a few complaints. The rest of us will be quite happy.PICTURE CLAIRITY RUNDOWN:HDTV: Aside from the above mentioned black levels, flawless, crisp and shockingly bright.DVD: Good picture, though not quite as good as I expected. Animated/Digitally generated DVD (think Shrek) are nearly as good as HDTV. I suspect this has to do with the set being an LCD projector.Digital Cable: Average to good, depending on channel, but most fall within the good range (Note: This is based on Comcast digital cable service in Washington DC).Regular Cable: N/A (I don't have it, so I don't know)Video Games: Sharp, crisp, and oh-so big. Very Good. (Note: Based on a first gen Sony PS2)Computer Monitor: Another task that I suspected would be a major hassle that actually went off with little incident was adding a TV out video card to my PC and hooking it directly to my Sony. The picture and resolution are flawless, and with a wireless mouse and keyboard, my sofa has become an extension of my home office.SOUNDIts...well, its actually not too bad, to be honest. I expected it to be crap, and compared to any decent surround-sound system it does seem rather anemic, but all in all they are quite good, and the audio options are numerous. I sill suggest a decent surround sound system, but you can live without it.EASE OF USEI think out of everything, this surprised me the most. I had purchased a new all-in-one Sony surround sound/DVD player with the television, and had my digital/HDTV cable box delivered a day before. I now had the daunting task of trying to coble all of this together.I won't lie about this; I was scared. The TV I had before this one was a 27\" GE that I first purchased when I joined the Navy, and the only input it had was a singular hookup for coaxial cable.To my surprise (and everlasting gratitude) It was amazingly easy. Three cables is all that it took (four if you count the Playstation), and it worked like a charm the first time around. Also here are 8 video input channels for this television, so I can't imagine I would ever run out of room for more devices.One note on this: With a set this good, and assuming you plan to hook it up to a 5.1 surround sound system, it is going to cost you about 300 bucks for new wires and a decent surge protector. Factor that into your final cost for this big-ticket item.","Date":"March 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great TV for half plasma price","Author":"Czar Paul","ReviewID":"R3SSBZAP1E7ZTZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Considering the price, this tv is a great value. I've been waiting for prices to come down and made the purchase soon after this model came out. There are multiple connections of all types including the cable card slot, which lets you get HDTV from your cable company without a set top box. The only drawback to this is that you don't get the program guide or any interactive features (program guide, PPV) with this feature. Hooked up to a HDTV signal, the picture is incredible. Football is super clear, and movies from HBO etc in HD also look great. Hook up a progressive scan DVD player and the picture is fantastic. The speakers are very good. Only drawback is that like any projection TV, there is an optimal viewing angle. You will notice a dimming of the picture as you move around.  When you see this TV, it's best to view it at an angle that you will be seeing it at home, even if that means looking silly in the showroom by crouching down when you look at it. Also be aware that you will have to replace the bulb on this type of tv as it ages.Added 2/08 To clarify my point about the picture dimming as you move, I really meant that you need to look at the TV at the correct height. The picture is much different if you stand higher than it rather that look at it direct on. I have not noticed a problem in the side to side viewing angle. Sorry for any confusion. After 3 months, I still love this set.","Date":"November 28, 2004"}
{"Title":"Sincerely Satisfying TV, despite Pro Reviews","Author":"J. Cascio \"Professional Escapist\"","ReviewID":"R22EUWV21NJEEK","Overall":"good","Content":"After dedicating a room in my basement for a home theater, I subsequently spent many, many weeks laboring over what TV was best for my application. I looked at every RPTV & Plasma that was carried by both Big-Chain & Custom A/V stores. You just can't find Plasma in this price range that is comparable in size, resolution and picture quality. That left DLP & LCD RPTVs. The Sony LCD RPTV line definitely was superior to any other brand out there, (thanks to Sony's WEGA engine). The price was fair at $2200. The picture quality is breathtaking on HD, excellent with DVD, and surprisingly acceptable on standard cable-TV.The TV is used primarily for watching DVDs.A word of caution to those with smaller rooms who are particular about picture quality...don't over buy (size). The downfall of fixed-resolution TVs (LCD, DLP) is the inability to adapt lower res. sources like DVD...not too noticeable unless you're seated close to the TV...like in my room. The viewing distance was only going to be 7-8 ft. at best with a 10ft. wide room. After standing the same distance away from the showroom TVs as my room affords me, I decided Sony delivered far and above the most impressive picture, despite the Professional Reviews I had read online. I also down graded from a 50in. to a 42in. This gave a slightly better viewing experience for the aforementioned reasons. I highly recommend taking advantage of the HDMI capabilities and purchasing an up-scaling HDMI DVD player. Both Sony & Panasonic have decent models for under $300. I went with the Sony DVP-NS975V. Once again, not great reviews, but astounding difference in the DVD picture quality. Combining this set with the right DVD player & sound system will give you a truly satisfying HT experience, without leaving you wondering where all your hard earned money went. The TV is bright, so you get a great picture with the lights on & off. Black level is acceptable; only notice the typical LCD/Black-level issues when the room is completely dark. I am not bothered by this.Bottom Line:Menu interface is intuitive.Picture presets are great and easy to customize, if needed.Sound is good, but if you're serious about the experience, you'll have an SS system.Picture quality is very impressive.Set dimensions are small, light and affordable compared to other LCD/DLP sets.Compared to other LCD/DLP sets, this is a 10. I gave it a nine overall because current fixed resolution TVs have inherent issues, (screen door/black-level,DLP-rainbow effect,etc.), that stop them from being perfect. But this one is pretty close.I just can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this set.","Date":"June 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best Picture on the Market","Author":"Ground Pounder \"Semper Fi\"","ReviewID":"R2B68YFOUYUEYL","Overall":"good","Content":"I looked at *many* televisions before buying this one.  While I was initially attracted to DLP projections (I am not impressed with the plasmas on the market), this Sony LCD projection caught my eye from all the way across the store.  It converts all signals to 720p, so you will see improvement even from standard (480i) signals.  With its built-in tuner, you'll be able to pull in HD signals as soon as you get home with only an antenna (the Zenith/Gemini ZHDTV1 is what I would recommend).  Having this television for the college bowl season was one of the happiest parts of my holiday, as I get all the local networks' digital broadcasts with my antenna (here's where 720p beats 1080i).  If you are a sports fan, you *need* an HDTV.There are numerous connections, including HDMI, and so far everything I have hooked up to this set looks amazing.  The settings menus are very easy to use, which is important since a little tweeking with the controls will ensure that each input performs at top quality.  One of the other reviewers suggested that the viewing angle is restrictive.  I could not disagree more: you basically have to be standing beside it or directly above for the picture to go dark.  I'd say the viewing angle is probably more than 150 degrees.In short, buy this set.  It is very affordable (less than half the price of a plasma the same size, with much better picture), has all of the bells and whistles (including a built-in HD tuner), and will look great in your living room.","Date":"January 4, 2005"}

The television in my living room was a 17 year old 36\" console televsion that had the tendancy to keep turning itself on and off after it had been on for over an hour.  I finally decided to break down and invest in a new quality television.  I first considered getting a plasma screen, but the based on the research I had done, I was not convinced that any added value a plasma screen may give you is worth the extremely higher price.  But this Sony WEGA LCD television is most definitely worth its price.Although not as narrow as a plasma screen television, at a mere 15\" in depth, even if space is a consideration, this television will not fail you.But it is the absolutely beautiful picture and incredibly crisp sound that are the true selling points for this TV.  The quality of the picture, even on the non-HDTV channels, is amazing.  I am still in awe of how much better the picture is now.  The quality of the HD channels absolutely blows me away.  While many shows on television aren't necessarily enhanced with HD programming (for instance, do you really need to see \"Judging Amy\" in pure digital, picture perfect quality?), but on certain programming such as sports or shows that have scenic backgrounds such as \"Lost,\" it is so amazing to see how beautiful they look on this television, I am probably too spoiled now to see them on any other television!I am also blown away with the stunning performance the television gives when playing DVDs.  I recommend getting the upgraded cables to connect your DVD player to the television.  But in any event, digital is what this TV was made for, and it is clear when playing DVDs.  Given the size of the screen and the quality of the picture, it is akin to actually being in the theater.The quality of the sound is also up to the standard you expect from Sony.  I do not yet have the television hooked up to any external speakers or any surround sound system, but instead rely only on the internal speakers.  Nonetheless, the sound is still perfect.  I am not a fan of watching of channels such as MTV, VH1, or the like, so cannot really speak as to how the sound system is on channels that are more sound reliant.  But you will not be disappointed with the sound on all the other channels.The added functions and features with the television are also quite impressive.  The picture-in-picture function is great, particularly if you like watching sports and can have a game on the smaller screen and watch regular programming on the main screen and click back and forth when something big happens in the game.  (I recently switched from cable to satellite -- a switch a highly recommend for everyone -- and have not figured out how, if at all, the picture-in-picture feature will work with satellite.)In short, I LOVE this television.  I am confident you will too.","Date":"March 18, 2005"}

I did get the store warranty, just in case!I have limited basic comcast BUT was shocked to see the TV picking up HD channels right out of the cable! I do not have a comcast cable box but the built in digital tuner did the magic. So I am enjoying about 10 HD channels with no cable box to add to the clutter. Picture quality is amazing! There are lots of inputs. I have connected its audio to Onkyo HT770 home theater via an optical cable. I have also managed to connect my computer to the TV via S-Video, since the HDMi input didnt work great for me - I had to get a DVi-HDMi cable ($120) but still I could not get resolutions more than 640x480. I have given up on that. Other than that, DVDs are rendered in progressive @480p with my Sony DVD player. The quality is good enough for me, to not think about going with an upconverter.The only thing I do not like about it is the lag between turning it on and picture showing up (about 10 seconds). There were some postings on the internet about the lamp life, but I believe those were earlier models. Also, the remote does not allow switching to an input directly (It has 7 video inputs). If I have to reach Video IN #5, I have to browse all the way from Video1. Maybe I need to read the manual real closely.Overall, good bang for your buck and an excellent candidate for a Home Theater hookup. However, I never had good luck making an HTPC out of it. SD channels do look a bit strange but acceptable. With the right set up, this TV can really turn your living room into a personal movie theater..for me it did!","Date":"February 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"Major Leap Forward in TV Tech","Author":"B. Johnson \"BJ\"","ReviewID":"R1E2F9HYHD4P8M","Overall":"good","Content":"After 23 years with a conventional NTSC t.v. we decided to  jump to HD digital. We started reviewing sets about three years ago and found the technology immature, outlandishly priced and dealer information usually wrong. While DLP works well for video presentation projectors, you need a two or three chip set to do away with picture lag, and pictures look pixellated. Hitachi has already announced they are dropping DLP technology. Plasmas STILL suffer problems with burn-in even with picture-shift technology, they often die in 3 or 4 years, can be noisy especially above 4,000' altitude, and are fragile. Gas is gas and it leaks, degrades, has a half-life and despite urban legend gas in plasma tvs cannot be replaced. Dealers lie constantly--one told us that Plasmas now last 16 years!On to the Sony 42we655. Settling on Sony was a leap of faith. Our last experience with Sony equipment, an amp, was not a good one; quality control dropped since the 1970s when Sony was king and we had been buying Panasonic.  However, the built in featurs on this LCD TV especially the integrated NTSC and ATSC tuners and cable card slot cinched it. Prices vary wildly on the Net, but once you factor in shipping they all come out to about $2,100 to $2,500. The competing units are cheaper, but have no tuners,so add $300.We elected to buy it from Circuit City to avoid shipping costs and drop-kicks by shippers. CC is having financial difficulties, so we declined the extended CC-backed warranty in case they crater in competition with Best Buy.The unit took all of 20 mnutes to set up with no technical knowledge necessary. Don't let the CC delivery crew cable it to amps and DVDs because they don't know your equipment. Reading the manual first is a must because the unit is technologically advanced, but well worth it. Plan to spend several nights learning how to operate it and refining the adjustments. If you don't want to do this, turn it over to a spouse, geek friend or teenager.The picture quality is outstanding, and we get amazing HD signals with a set of rabbit ears in a rural area! Don't fret about the bulb, changing it is about 5 minutes work --no harder than an LCD projector bulb. A word about DVD connections, don't try to run a one-cable composite video feed from a DVD---spend the $40 and get component cables which give a much better picture. DVD quality differs wildly, so don't judge the set until you look at several different DVDs. Some writers have remarked about blacks. Yes, high CGI (computer graphic) special effects movies are dark, even in the theaters. CGI looks bad in sunlight which is why the movis are set at night. Video tape signals are amazingly bad because of the quality, so don't blame the set---just get rid of or transfer your old tapes and go to DVD.A great tv that you will enjoy exploring.","Date":"February 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good Price, Great Quality","Author":"J. M. Cranford \"JMC\"","ReviewID":"R2PFBUIU8VJ4BU","Overall":"good","Content":"As others have mentioned, I researched several TVs and their technologies before settling on the Sony 42\" LCD Projection HDTV.  I'm pleased.  Even with the wide screen, the TV isn't too large and doesn't take up much space.  It's not heavy either.Very nice picture.  Standard definition programming is unremarkable, but HD content is spectacular.  I went with the 42\" because the larger screens aren't quite as bright considering that they all use the same high intensity bulb.  It's more screen to illuminate.  The 42\" screen was more than adequate.  Huge in fact.Even though I have the sound running through a six speaker Sony Dream home theater system, the TV's sound is very nice.  Unless you're wanting the booming vibration of a subwoofer, the TV's speakers are fine for everyday viewing and listening.Of all the reputable retailers, Amazon.com has the best price by far.  I looked at Sears, Circuit City, Best Buy, and other online retailers.  I decided to go with Amazon because of reputation, lower price, and shipping costs.  I found this TV for a little cheaper online from unknown retailers, but the trust factor led me back to Amazon.The shipping process was wonderful.  Arrived in about a week.  EagleGL was the carrier.  The guy called me on my cell a few minutes before he pulled up to the house.  I met him there.  He unloaded it, opened the box, placed it on my TV stand, and carried off the cardboard.","Date":"April 27, 2005"}

This is a wonderful television!  I preferred the LCD over DLP because of my picture preferences.  The DLP's seem to have a slightly darker picture.  Go somewhere and view them both and then decide for yourself.  It is a personal decision and no one can make it for you.  The only warning I would give is be certain your viewing area is large enough.  You can't sit on top of these and expect a great picture.  The further away the better the clarity.  I know someone who bought the 50\" just to have a bigger set and the room is too small.  Move away however and you will absolutely love it!","Date":"February 18, 2005"}

{"Title":"One word - UNBELIEVABLE!!!","Author":"Beerman \"Beerman\"","ReviewID":"R2ZKBOJ6BNGCF4","Overall":"good","Content":"Updated:  2/22/09 - After nearly four years of owning this TV it still looks and works great!  No problems whatsoever.  Obviously this model is only 1080i but that is the best you can get with most cable and dish services anyway.=================I've had this unit for a few weeks now.  It is unbelievable!  The picture quality in HD and viewing DVD's is incredible.The only frustration I have and this goes for ALL Sony products is the manual.  Their products are outstanding but the manuals that accompany them are very difficult to decipher unless you are a true audiophile.  After a few hours of tinkering around though I was able to get it all hooked up and the next day when my cable guy came out to install the HD box he made a few adjustments that got everything working.My suggestion: If you are going to make this type of an investment including home audio and video equipment, spend a few hundred dollars extra and have a professional come out and hook it up.  I didn't do this but in hindsight I think it would have been worth it.Once it's all hooked up and working the way you want it you won't believe the oooh's and aaah's you will get from this thing.  My father and father-in-law were in town over the weekend to watch NBA basketball.  Neither of them had ever seen an HD picture and both said it was better than actually being at the game.Enjoy this product.  You won't be disappointed!","Date":"May 26, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great HD quality, disappointing SD quality","Author":"Dan Liebgold","ReviewID":"R27G1Q7P2D5JC7","Overall":"good","Content":"The good news is the TV is user friendly and worked perfectly for everything we tried right away. It found over the air digital channels (some in HD) and all the inputs worked as advertised.The bad news is the standard definition image quality is a big disappointment compared to the trinitron tube I was used to! Maybe this won't be a surprise to others but it was to me. Even watching digital channels and using s-video or component inputs, the image is evidently not scaling up very well. This maybe has to do with the native resolution of the display (1386 x 788) and the way the image is scaled up. I'm guessing that SD images don't align with the native pixels no matter what the TV circuitry does. The pixels bleed noticeably and text edges are doubled when they should be crisp.Something else to get used to (really I can't decide if its worse or just different) is the 'glare' of this backlit set. The TV uses a bright lamp to back-light the LCD, and for images with light colors the glare can be hard on the eyes. This may be a matter of taste, but it is something to get used to.The one bright spot of hope is the digital HD image quality. Once tuned to a real HD digital signal, the TV begins to really shine. Even without an HD signal you can see the potential in the on-screen menus. Suddenly there are no scaling artifacts, the pixels are crisp and clear, and even the brightness and colors are more even and less eye-tiring. I dread going back to a non HD signal.So if you are upgrading step by step, be prepared for a new-found motivation to upgrade all available equipment to make sure you are in HD land as much as possible. Digital HD cable, DirectTV HD, and over the air digital HD are your friends. ReplayTV, DVDs, and standard channels will get more tiresome with this TV.","Date":"June 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great TV","Author":"Kyle D. Gendron","ReviewID":"R19S2MBBIVQASA","Overall":"good","Content":"We have needed a new TV to replace the 32\" Sony I bought in 1995. I researched for months. For the longest time I was leaning towards a 34\" tube model. Then I found this set coming down in price at various web sites. I check it out in person in a few different stores and really liked the picture.I finally made the purchase in Mid August at a high-end TV store. Got it as a floor model at about $600 of list price. Could pass up the deal.At first I found the standard digital channels (on Comcast digital) were really not very clear. Then we ended up having an issue with the cable box and not getting channels. Comcast came by and found we had to many splitters coming off our main cable feed. (We have 2 digital cable boxes, 2 HDTV boxes and 1 line for broadband internet) The cable guy took away a few of the 2 way splitters and converted to 4 way splitters and also added an amplifier.Since then the non-HD channels are coming in much better. Still not quite as good as on the old TV or on the 34\" HD tube TV we have, but much better than it was.As for the HD channels themselves: When the broadcast is in HD, the picture is AWESOME! Especially Discovery HD, ESPN HD and all the NFL games broadcast in HD. I love this TV.The 42\" size is big, but not out of control. Right now we are watching from about 10' away.One of the things I like best is the picture in picture. It's a side by side picture. You can have both screen's the same size or make one bigger. I believe there are 3 or 4 different setting for size. Great when watching 2 NFL games on Sundays or you want to watch the football game and baseball game at the same time. When both screens are the same size, its like watching 2 20\" TV next to each other.DVD's are also great with this TV. I have the cable hooked up via the HDMI and the DVD with the composite video. Haven't watched a lot of DVD's yet, but with the few we have its been a great experience.This is now the centerpiece of my home theater system that consists of a Denon 6.1 digital receiver, Klispch front and center speakers, 4 Cambridge Sound-Works rear and side speakers, Panasonic DVD player and Sony VCR.No need to go to the movies again!Thank you Sony!","Date":"September 20, 2005"}

{"Title":"A great TV for the money","Author":"Trivia Master","ReviewID":"R25YHHFDPQT1KD","Overall":"good","Content":"After doing a vast amount of research, I came to the conclusion that the Sony was one of the best bargains that I saw. I gave it a 4 out of 5 mainly because of the fact that the daytime viewing is NOT as clear and detailed as my other Sony; A 36XBR250 VEGA without HD. Actually, some of the standard displays on the older Sony are better than the LCD. I am probably going to get an upscaler to match the display to the best that it can do. As far as using the remote, I set all the inputs to video 5 and play them through my Denon 3803 receiver. I also have a Pioneer Elite laser, Panasonic DVD RP91 and a Pioneer 563A. I feel that the upscaler would take the place of much higher equipment. I can't wait for the NEW 1920 X 1024 displays which are coming in 3-4 years. By then, I will tire of the LCD and go with a plasma or projection. I DID get the warranty, as the price of the bulb is included and 1 thing wrong makes up the difference. My price at Good Guys was $2149.00, + tax, $399.00 for 5 year warranty, $299.00 for set up that took 5 hours and included wiring for 7 different items. The next $ amount spent will be on a certified calibration for the BEST picture..GREAT TV!!!!","Date":"February 28, 2005"}

I'm not sure if they'll cover the diagnosis but its on sony's website.[...]As technology evolves, Sony continually looks to stand behind the reliability of its televisions. It has come to our attention that a limited number of Grand WEGA rear projection televisions (models listed above), after a period of time, exhibit blue dot or star pattern on the screen.In addition, for any customer who later experiences this issue on one of the affected models, Sony will cover the cost of the optical block repair (parts and labor) at no charge through December 31, 2008. All other terms of the Sony limited warranty continue to apply. Sony utilizes a network of hundreds of qualified independent third-party servicers to perform in-home television warranty service. Sony, through its authorized service network, will endeavor to repair your set within 30 days of your first contact. For diagnosis, warranty service, or if you are not provided a repair within 30 days, please contact Sony at (888) 649-7669.Update: 6/6/2009As I originally wrote this posting- my tv was fixed but from what i remember the due date to get it fixed for FREE was before December 2008. I had mine fixed in November. When you called customer service you have to tell them exactly what is happening and just like the sony posting says. It is blue spots all over the screen and it's the optical block. The repair people called me and they came fixed it for free in 2 days. With Sony Customer Service you have TO SAY EXACTLY HOW IT INDICATED ON THEIR WEBSITE and show that you know what you were talking about. It was right on their website along with pictures. THEY SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED WILL BE CORRECTED FOR FREE AND NEW OPTICAL BLOCK INSTALLED. Usually the optical block is $850 and a new one made my scrreen scream like new again.

We are just now looking at replacing this tv with a newer model and have even rearranged the bedroom just so we can keep this tv.

This appeared after the bad winter of 2010 when the local networks ran a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen for a week for school closings.  It created an imprint of this blue streak.  Over time that faded, but seemed to move up vertically across the screen over to the right side.  It left a lavendar fade out in the center and as that started to move upwards to the top these stars appeared in the center - as if the streak was breaking up.So now we have a star-lit screen that really shows up when the screen goes dark upon turning the tv power off.  So far the picture is alright.  And replacing the lamp was done before this occurred.Sony suggests it be repaired since nothing can be done, but if everyone is right about the cause and cost, we will be looking for a new set - and not a Sony.","Date":"November 17, 2011"}

Wu \"WWW\"","ReviewID":"RWF4OJGXSL8IP","Overall":"good","Content":"I'd like to start this review with a disclaimer.  I am very happy with the TV.  It works exactly the way it's supposed to.  Problem is, nobody who sells the thing tells you how it's SUPPOSED to work.When you are looking at these things in the store, notice that there is always a DVD playing, or they have the set turned to Discovery HD Theater.  There is a reason for this.  An LCD HD monitor that is showing a regular (I think analog) or even a digital signal will not show well.  The picture quality is lower than that of a regular CRT TV in these cases due to the extreme pixelation of the image.However, if you position the TV correctly in your viewing space, some of this will be aleviated.  For a 50 inch TV, you should sit back between 10-15 feet from the screen.  From that far, you really won't see the pixels, so it won't bother you.  (You can definitely tell the difference between HD and non-HD from this disctance still).  This viewing disctance is what the manufacturers tell you to do.  Do not buy this TV and sit 8 feet away and expect to be happy with it.I say all this not to harp on Sony.  THEIR PRODUCT WORKS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S LCD!!!  You should know this because currenlty only 10-15 channels are broadcast in HD depending on your vendor and region.  Therefore - if you have 150 channels, 90% will not be in HD, so the majority of your viewing will be pixelated.OK - all that said - it's a great TV.  All the pro's have already been discussed - so I won't go there.","Date":"January 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Excellent picture in every way except black level and 480p","Author":"J. Demmon","ReviewID":"R1QZC63MNTUOAY","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is capable of astounding IMAX-like pictures when viewing a good HDTV signal.  Has very good 480i/NTSC up-conversion but only so-so at 480p.  That's because the advanced video processing menu option is only available for 480i and NTSC, not 480p (progressive).  As a consequence the TV does a really amazing job at up-converting ordinary analog tv signals and 480i DVD output.  But 480p component/DVI DVD is NOT as good as 480i component DVD, at least with my Denon 1910.  The sony's 480i up-converter even has an edge over the Denon's 720p and 1080i internal DVI up-converters.  Too bad you can't get 480i over DVI.As others have noted, black level is mediocre.  The screen puts out a glow during dark scenes that can't be adjusted away.  You don't really notice it in a brightly lit room.  But in a dark room it is very much apparent.  Before buying, judge for yourself by playing Harry Potter 3 or other dark movie in a dark room.  Turning on the DVD player's black level boost can help separate dark scenes from the background glow without compromising normally lit scenes.After about a month, I got use to the glow and don't really notice it except during extended, very dark scenes.","Date":"December 4, 2004"}

A previous reviewer complained that the bulb blew after 30 min. Well, This happens sometimes. I've had light bulbs blow that fast. All he had to do was go to Circuit City and get another. He then could have installed it himself, an easy chore. To return a TV because the bulb went is simply foolish.Update:I wrote the above based on what I saw in the store. I now have had this TV for one week and Still think it's great. This tv converts standard signals to HDTV like resolution which works very well. The standard signals are the best I've ever seen, very HDTV like. Some people complain that LCD TV's don't produce deep blacks well. This may bother some but I don't notice it at all. The TV, while not flat, is only 17\" thick and weighs only 83 lbs. It has built in hand holds so 2 people han easily pick it up and carry it around. It has more inputs than I'll ever need (8 components). Thre are optical and coaxial digital outs for surround sound. I couldn't be more satisfied. For $2700 at Circuit City I consider this a bargain.Update 2:Sept 30 2005, After 10 months no change of opinion. We watch the TV every day. No problems at all.

I can not comment about off air TV quality.I chose an LCD based product because I could see the rainbow on some DLP based products. There is also a squeal audible (color wheel?) with some DLP products. I chose the Sony because it does not give much of a \"screen door\" appearance as some other LCD projectors do.If using a home theatre or surround sound receiver for your audio be sure to get a \"fast\" TV like this one.

The samsung service was INCREDIBLY bad--it couldn't be any better than what is described in other reviews.  I had innumerable problems with this TV, including service calls, washed out images, and total failure.  I finally got them to give me \"permission\" to trade this in for the sony.  This product is far superior.  However, do yourself a favor and get a calibration disc.  This will improve the picture immeasurably.  If you are going to spend big bucks on a tv, pay the money to get the dark/light and color in focus.  How can others complain about the \"black,\" if they haven't had it professionally calibrated?  Playing with the tv menu and complaining is like changing the stations on your car radio and saying your engine now runs rough.  geez!My only complaint also concerns outputs which are limited as another person stated.  However, if you hook up inputs correctly, the output problem becomes mute.  I run a satellite receiver, DVD/VHS, 6 speakers (psb and paradigm) and audio receiver with this TV, so connections are a bit tricky.  I also wish that they had included the computer input which many other hdtv's have--however the price of this tv is somewhat lower than other 50\" so that trade-off seems understandable.

I have been a audio/video engineer for 30 yrs. Here are my thoughts.I have 3 hi-quality LCD panels in my home, 32, 42, and 47\", blu-rays, 7.1, etc. I also have a 15K plus tube audio system here. I have experience with stuff.This panel honestly blew me away with the accurate color reproduction it offers. The best I have seen, and have seen Sony Broadcast monitors...you name it.Internal sound is good, but not using it. It feeds a 7.1 system in my secondary theater room {man cave}. This panel has never been in a smoking home.I read all the reviews I could find on this.Everyones eyes and ears are different.This panel had 11.5K hours on it via the accesible menu. The original owners I bought it from got it new in 2006. They NEVER did a thing to it, but were aware about how the bulb is supposed to be replaced after so many hours. SO I bought a new one for $61. Much cheaper now than years ago. I truly can not tell a difference between the new one and a 11.5K hr bulb. Incredible. I kept the old one for a spare.I realize this isn't the norm by my readings.I see no artifacts that make me feel the optical block has Any issues. HD signals look fabulous. I put in Wizard of OZ Blu-Ray and it is incredible. Again, color reproduction is A++ along with most all other aspects of video that can can be scrutinized. The ONLY thing I see as previously mentioned is about the black level on certain material.This panel, to me, offers one an analogish digital picture if you will, without digital artifacts.I really am happy. I got this panel on Craigslist when I was looking for a TV stand. I literally got the panel for free!Apparantly many of the panels have been plaged with problems. This one is a keeper. It blows away my other 1080p panels, and this is 1080i. EASY on the eyes, as my vinyl LP's are easy on the ears vs my tube digital system which is no slouch. Feed this panel a HD signal to enjoy what it can offer. 480 looks like any other panel with a 480 signal. Not enough info for a big picture. Why folks complain about 480 is because they are not knowledeable enough to know why standard definition looks only fair vs 1080. Something to Bit@^! about.I am enjoying this alot. I hope your panel is trouble free like this one. This is a new experience for an old gray haired engineer. If it ends up needing a optical block I will replace it...it's that good.I read, if you don't have major issues with this panel, and replace the lamp as needed life expectancy is 27 yrs. Basically the life of capacitors.DavidWM5M Amateur Radio Operator Extra Class for 25 yrs, licensed since 1975...General Radio Telephone License as well, in Whos Who of Video....

{"Title":"High Class TV deserves a high end signal","Author":"RJLOne \"RJLOne\"","ReviewID":"R3EEZGUI2UH30H","Overall":"good","Content":"Let's be honest.  This is one very high class television with all the bells and whistles.  The picture it produces is incredible with either Digital Cable or HDTV signal, and is just as amazing when used with Optical, S-Video, or Progressive Scan component cables from a DVD/VCR.  The clarity, brilliance, and color rendition is A+ through and through.  You'd be hard pressed to find folks to disagree with that.  The area where this TV gets dinged in the same for any large screen LCD, DLP, or Plasma unit - no one likes the low resolution analog delivery when a large widescreen is hooked up to a poor analog cable or worse still VHF or UHF non-digital signal.  So make a commitment now that you are shopping for a big screen HDTV set-up.  If you are willing to spend a couple of grand on a large screen high-end television, you should really give consideration to providing that television with a high-end signal.  That means getting digital cable, satellite (digital signal), a house antenna for free over-the-air HDTV, and investing in a DVD/VCR that has the modern outputs.  Do that and you are going to be in awe each night you settle in front of this television.  Don't do it and you are going to settle for less than this television can provide.I've owned this television for about one year now.  I can tell you that it is highly impressive.  The clarity and depth of the picture are astonishing and the brilliance is fantastic.  Style-wise, okay, the newer model of this same system is more \"modern\" than this.  Sound-wise, this system produces clear tones and great surround.  I utilize this set with a home theatre set-up using Optical out from the TV and am immersed with sound.  And I can say that playing Xbox on this set-up with the MS HD component cables is astoundingly realistic.The really great features too are that this does have its own integrated ATSC tuner to decode the HD free over-the-air signals.  And better still the no need for picture-in-picture when you can split the screen and watch them side-by-side (though you can't do that with two ATSC tuned stations - one has to be analog).But probably the best perspective I can give you is that I treat the guests to my home who haven't yet seen such a high-end widescreen television to a bit of a test.  I display for them the analog every day picture first in full 16:9 view and then in 4:3 standard.  They instantly agree that analog in 16:9 is not sharp, and less appealing.  Then I switch it over to a digital connection and they are back to being awed.  Finally, I tune in an HDTV broadcast and everyone is absolutely mesmorized.  During the Superbowl this year one of my party guests exclaimed, \"Wow!  I can see individual faces in the stadium seats when the cameras are watching the action on the field.\"  Yes, I know.  I get that enjoyment every single day when I power up the Sony 50\".  If you are seriously looking to get a big screen, this one is the absolute way to go!  I'll leave the rest to argue over which is better, an LCD Projection, DLP, LCD flat panel, or Plasma.  I already know.  It's sitting in my entertainment center.","Date":"March 7, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent product at a great price!!","Author":"PapaRaver","ReviewID":"R3UZDH46E1LOSR","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been researching plasma screens for about a year before I finally decided on a Panasonic.  I was headed towards the consumer model with all the options, (which was a Consumer Reports best buy and the top rated CNET plasma), but then I found this model.  It's the professional version with the same screen.  It comes with inputs for component, composite, s-video, and PC.  You can order other input cards for HMDI or any other input device if you want it.  It doesn't have speakers or a tuner, which is okay for me since I have a DVR and I use my surround system.  All I needed was a great looking screen and this is it.  I shopped around for pricing on all the shopping sites, and there are some shady places that sell opened boxes or reconditioned screens for a \"better price\".  Some try the old bait and switch or try to sell you the massive extended warranty.  Panasonic won't honor the warranty from some of these stores too!  Beware!  The best price from a reputable place is from Tiger Direct.  I hadn't ordered from them before, but I figured I'd have Amazon's buyer protection if I needed it.  They shipped my order the same day and it arrived six days later via ABF Freight.  I had ordered a Peerless SF-660P wall mount for it that arrived the same day, thank goodness!  (I got it from the Peerless Industries website, if you're interested.) Everything is perfect and I couldn't be happier with how this screen looks on my wall.

{"Title":"5 YEARS AND GOING STRONG","Author":"El Gran Jaibo \"Jaibo\"","ReviewID":"REJ32TNFD28E2","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Sony KDF55E Projection LCD TV in 2006 and have no complaints. It is viewable from anywhere in the room. It's about 12\" deep and not a flat panel TV but it is a flat screen TV. When I play certain HD programming, you can sure tell the difference in resolution. It's really quite amazing how beautiful a National Geographic Special program can be in true High Defenition. I love it! And of course the Sony surroundsound system I got at the same time adds to the experience. Note that I have a nice, smaller TV in my bedroom that's hooked up to my laptop computer and a DVD player and my Klipsch Pro-Media 2.1 speakers(awesome). I don't watch the big Sony TV that much so it's got low miles. I mention that because in August of 2010 I got the first message on screen when I turned it on that the bulb was nearing it's life expectancy and should be replaced. It's been over a year and I still get the message every time I turn it on, but the picture is perfect and I'm waiting for a sign that it's really about to go out. I hear it's about $200-$250 for the new bulb. Overall I'm very happy with the TV set. But next time I probably won't go quite so big. UPDATE: July of 2013 the bulb has finally burnt out almost three years after that message started showing up every time I turned the TV on. I'll report again after I replace it and use it for awhile.","Date":"October 18, 2011"}
{"Title":"How I Found my HDTV","Author":"Richard Krzemien","ReviewID":"R6FWB0T6QX736","Overall":"good","Content":"I started searching for an HDTV about seven-years ago while doing some work at CES in Las Vegas.  I still remember the moment I spotted my first HD set there.  It was a 60\" Zenith showing a Dallas Cowboys football game.  I stared at the box for about an hour with a small drop of drool hanging from my chin-despite really disliking the Cowboys.  After talking with the sales rep., I was sure I'd have a set within a year.  Then the HD standards wars began, things got ugly and everything was put on hold.Years passed.  My son, who was 9-years old at the time of the CES show, got older and I got grumpier.With each passing season I would check out every new HDTV set.  I looked at successive generations of plasmas, front projectors, DLPS, LCDs,  rear-projection RGB sets and D-ILAs.  Each time I thought, this year, this technology will be the one where cost, styling and picture quality converge to produce the winner.  But plasma was way too expensive, and every other technology had artifacts that left me wanting.  And that Zenith I saw at CES? That was a one-of-a-kind TV that cost about 100K.  So each year my son and I returned home empty handed.Then last year I walked into a showroom and my heart fluttered for the first time since that day in Vegas.  Sitting on a high-tech stand was a stunning Sony 60\" Grand Vega XBR.  It was a gorgeous package with an amazingly sharp picture.  But after looking closer, I started seeing artifacts that made me reconsider:  Fast motion sequences would pixelate.  The \"screen door effect\" started bothering me, and the shiny glass font reflected everything that wasn't black.  What I thought was going to be a long-term relationship-and an important bonding experience with my son-became a 1-hour fling.  My son didn't talk to me for a week.Then this past October (2004), Sony released its KDF-60XS955.  I read every review.  I scanned all the specs.  I waited for it to arrive somewhere, anywhere.  Then one day as I was walking through Frys, I spotted one on the showroom floor and immediately fell in love.  In fact, I was stunned at how attractive the entire package was: great looks, great price, and a great picture.  Something had to be wrong.I didn't tip my hand immediately.  I went home and came back a few days later to see if my memory of the set was as good as the actual thing.  Amazingly, it was.  That had never happened before.  When viewing other sets for a second time, I found that my memory of them was always better than the real thing.So I came back to view the 60XS955 five more times, and each time the picture thrilled me. I was even more amazed when I learned that the 60XS955 I had been looking at was connected to a set of rabbit ears-not cable or satellite like all the other sets-just a $12 piece of metal sitting on top of the Sony. I went to other stores to see what the picture looked like connected to satellite and I was even more impressed.Needless to say, I finally bought one.  When it arrived and I turned it on, it looked even better than in the showroom.  It took a few days to figure out that, since I don't have 90 fluorescent tube lights installed in the ceiling of my living room, I don't have all that ambient light reflecting off the front of the screen.  When my now 16-year-old son first saw the picture (during a Lakers/Rockets game that was being broadcast in HD) he hugged me and said those three words every father longs to hear, \"So how much?\"  I told him it was about $700 below retail (Pacific Sales in L.A.)  He then mumbled that he loved me and we all watched the game together.If you're interested in all the specs, you can easily get them from Sony.  But here are a few that were important to me.  This set finally incorporates and standardizes a number of different technologies.  For example, it has a CableCard input.  I have cable, so by renting the CableCard and avoiding the charge for a second cable box from Time Warner, I save $5.50/mo.  I believe the CableCard also produces a cleaner signal, but I've not done a side-by-side comparison yet.The set has a built-in HD turner if you want to pick up off-the-air broadcasts with your own set of $12 rabbit ears.  The front screen has a matt finish so you won't see those nasty glass reflections that the XBR series produces.  Possibly because of the matt finish and a smaller chipset most, if not all, of the \"screen door effect\" has been eliminated.  The processors are now faster so there's little to no pixelation in the background of fast-moving sequences, unlike the current crop of DLP sets that produce a tiling effect with fast moving images. The NTSC tuner has been greatly improved so normal, non-digital or non-HD broadcasts are watchable.  (You immediately get spoiled with HD, so anything less is a letdown, but they're watchable.)  All of these advances have converged to produce images that almost look 3-D when viewing HD broadcasts.This 60\" Sony also sports the new HDMI connection standard that allows for uncompressed HD and non-HD DVD viewing with DVD players that have an HDMI output.  The remote is adequate, but somewhat of a letdown.  The accompanying Sony stand is a bit expensive but gorgeous, and a perfect match for this set.  This year's stand also has 2 shelves; unlike the one shelve on last year's XBR model.  The sound is rich and full with a respectable sub-woofer.  All of that and the TV weighs only about 113 lbs.A side note:  I've read that some people have complained about visual noise or distortion.  I believe much of it comes from cheap cables and connectors.  This set is very sensitive and very big.  Small amounts of snow on a 27\" set can look like a snowstorm on a 60\" set.  But with the right cables the picture is crystal clear.  So don't cheep out.  Get the more expensive shielded, gold-plated cables, like those from Monster, for example.  Also, get an AC line filter and surge protector (About $79.  Mine is also a Monster.  It will clean up the picture, protect the sensitive electronics and extend the life of the bulb).  With those added items, this TV should look like you're viewing reality.So after a seven-year wait, I've finally found my HD set.  My son has a new-found respect for my nerdy side, my wife now knows that there really wasn't \"another woman\" working at Frys I'd been seeing, and the space I had reserved seven-years ago along the wall in my living room has finally been filled with a truly beautiful piece of technology.Richard Krzemien[...]","Date":"December 29, 2004"}
{"Title":"First Impression: A great new model Sony HDTV","Author":"G. Davis","ReviewID":"R35ZSHGLV2X8EI","Overall":"good","Content":"First impresssion:  I love it.  The HD picture is absolutely gorgeous and, happily, the SD picture seems to be very much improved over what the Sony HDTV's produced with their 2003 models. The TV has two tuners, including a built-in digital HDTV tuner, and it will accept a \"cable card\" so you don't need a box.The manual leaves something to be desired.  Many subjects that should be discussed in detail are barely mentioned.  I wonder if the manual-writers actually watched or adjusted this TV before writing about it.Example: The \"Live Color\" setting merits only a sentence or two in the manual but, as the default setting from the factory, it made all the white areas of the picture swim crazily, like a 1960's \"psychedelic\" poster until, through trial and error, I found it buried in \"Advanced\" video settings and turned it off.There are two coax cable inputs, \"VHF/UHF\" and \"Cable\".  I think the former is mostly for attaching an external antenna and your cable from the wall really has to go into the other one but this is not made clear.  In any case, cable attached to \"VHF/UHF\" will not tune to very many channels and there is no setting in the menus to alter this.  The manual is not helpful on this subject.\"Twin View\" is great -- very useful, very intuitive.The TV's styling, with speaker \"wings\" out on either side of the screen, is very beautiful.Sony had a lot of trouble with lamp and lamp-starter problems in the 2003 models, which they believe they fixed in mid-2004.  We can be hopeful that, in the new models, they have fixed it for good.All I have right now are my first impressions and they are very, very good.  I love this TV!","Date":"October 28, 2004"}

What impressed me was the standard def picture. Most HD sets look really really good in HD but fall flat on their face in std. def. This set looked reasonably good in SD in the store so I hoped it would at home. It did. Not as good as my old RPTV but good enough. The HD images (especially on Discovery HDT) are unreal and very 3D. It shows up some HD channels that compress to much in their broadcast.There are always anomolies with high tech items and this set is no exception, hence 4 stars not 5 for what is a very good set.1) Audio out doesn't work like expected. If you have a set of wireless headphones, say one from Sony?, you can't use them. You see, you have to TURN OFF the attached speakers to use the audio out jacks. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?! ADA FAILURE.2) Say you take the time to label all your channels so they read CNN NBC ABC etc as you surf. Then let's say down the road you scan the channels to see if your CATV provider added any new ones. Well all that work went down the drain because it erases all the labels. OOPS!3)Let's say you have a TiVo or ReplayTV and hook it to input 3 using S-Video. What about none of the label choices say DVR until input 5/Component.Am I picky? Sure, it's $4K! There shouldn't be any issues, they should use the set they make and figure it out before selling it.One more thing, I'm using a Harmony 676 and it has discreet input codes all the way to input 7, then 8 is 7 + up one. Maybe that's a Harmony issue, but I don't think Sony has a discreet code for input 8. Oh Well.It's still a good set and has very nice imaging!","Date":"January 31, 2005"}

In 2005 while buying DVD's I wanted to stroll thru the TV's and see the new technology. That's when I came across Sony's art work. Stylish frame with the side speakers was impressive. A matte front panel to protect the screen and reduce glare (not many with this feature), good for little kids that have to touch everything! It's more affordable with the combination of projection with the sharp picture of an HD LCD. If your kids play a lot of video games (me sometimes) you don't have to worry about screen burn. HDMI connections with more than enough video ports to hook up everything - HD satellite box, receiver/amplifier, DVD, VCR, Xbox, Wii, Play Station 3. Plus Memory stick compatible to really show off the family pictures (so your old parents can see them)! ;^) As far as HD action goes - I watch Discovery HD, HD sports, HD movies action and Sci Fi with no problems. Once you go HD it's difficult to watch standard definition. Put it this way, after looking at it on the sales room floor and finding out about it's features I looked at my wife to discuss finances when she said \"Go ahead and get it, I love it.\". Sold!  Writing this in June 2008 with over 8300+ hrs on the lamp timer and just replaced the lamp. I found one online for $130 and how to reset the timer myself. It's an easy change out.

I looked at many models, and this seemed to be the best value.  The sound is phenomenal, deep stereo which surprises you from just looking at the built-in speakers.  I have enjoyed the sound in watching concert videos, such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Jefferson Airplane, the Who, James Taylor, etc.  The controls are complicated and not well designed.  There are too many buttons, and it is hard to find on the remote what you want it to do.  The high-def picture is excellent.  I have it hooked up to a Cablevision box.  The best picture is for baseball and football games, PBS high-def, and the Tonight Show with Leno.  For some reason, these shows stand out in their clear crisp picture and sound.  The price of this TV has dropped considerably over the past few months, so it is an even better buy.  Don't try to save a little money by buying a no-name brand.  You will enjoy spending a little more for a quality picture and sound set.","Date":"September 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Very, very nice LCD for a bedroom.","Author":"N. Reyes \"The gizmo guy\"","ReviewID":"R353I8HJ2W7GWJ","Overall":"good","Content":"In a nutshell, this LCD is a very nice LCD...if you have the optimum connection, which is HDMI, and you have an HDTV receiver (which is free from Comcast, my cableTV provider).  Right off the box and after connecting to regular cable to it, it doesn't bring out the optimum reception.  Actually, it looked pretty average and even looked like total crap on some channels until I got the HDTV receiver and saw what high definition TV is *supposed* to look like.  You can still connect this TV to component video and get a nice reception, but nothing beats HDMI.  Trust me, it's worth shelling out an expensive HDMI cable for this - there is a BIG difference from component video to HDMI - so I would definitely recommend that you connect it this way.  Needless to say, the reception when the connection is through HDMI is immaculate and close to perfect!","Date":"January 28, 2005"}

It hooks up easily with my DVD player and my laptop, does exactly what it's supposed to do, is intuitive to use, and has never caused me any trouble.I read the other reviews complaining about workmanship, but my TV is almost 4 years old and has had zero problems (even bulb failures).  That's even more impressive since I shipped it 3,000 miles across the country when moving and am sure it was jostled.Things to note: the TV looks best when the overhead lights are dim, and it takes 10-15 seconds to turn on (which seems slow).  Also, the sound quality is not the best available.  However, I still give the TV 5 stars because these problems are minor and addressable, because I have a separate sound system, and because overall the TV has exceeded my expectations and was a great value for the price I paid.One last point: Visitors are extremely impressed with this TV, because it looks sexy and expensive.  If you a modest person, this TV could come across as more ostentatious than its smaller cousins.  However, if you like the attention, the style points, and a fantastic viewing experience, this TV is for you.","Date":"December 12, 2009"}
{"Title":"Mitsubishi W-52327 review","Author":"Xavier Sepeda \"xs\"","ReviewID":"R1G09OJQF4XJQY","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first big screen HDTV. Initially I was excited about the prospect of having a big screen high definition tv. I paid my satellite company for the HD channels and HD receiver.  The fact is from the variety of different HD channels, only a limited few are of any interest, for me at least. So I canceled the HD channels and now have the basic lineup. But since I still have the HD receiver I do get all local channels that program in HD. Which amounts to major broadcast stations primetime and news programs. Back to my review for the tv. I've had it for two years now and the picture shows great, I also bought the stand and it looks very contemporary. In two years I've had the bulb changed twice (first time 14 mos. and the next 8 mos.). So figure about once every year, give or take useage. And the bulb costs $169.00. I paid for a 5 year $329.00 extended warranty, so luckily it's been covered. But after that I'm on my own. Unfortunately the tv speakers don't work with my satellite, only the surround sound system is connected. It's not been a big deal. So all in all for my first HD tv the 52\" size and the picture is what impressed me. My next tv I'll have to research a little harder and find one that doesn't burn through the bulbs so fast.","Date":"January 16, 2008"}

{"Title":"Great Value","Author":"Robert Traub \"Robert Traub\"","ReviewID":"R3ERVD89CL33YR","Overall":"good","Content":"My old projection TV died (the cost of repair exceeded what I originally paid for it), and I went in search of a new one.  One of the big electronics stores was having a floor model sale, and given the huge discounts off the regular price, I was drooling. I had a choice between all the top brands (they were clearing everything out to put new models on the floor) and the opportunity to compare them side by side.  While RCA is a name steeped in history, I wasn't aware they were still in the game until I came upon this unit.  When I saw the picture this unit produces, I was hooked; it exceeded anything in the price range.  Yes, there were TV's from the leading projection, LCD and plasma players that had remarkable pictures, but I wasn't interested in them for (literally) thousands more.  I agonized about buying this \"low-end\" RCA, but finally decided to give it a new home. In the ensuing 5 months, I have not regretted it.Before going further, there are a few essential caveats I must state. First and foremost, I do not have cable or satellite. The TV lives in a somewhat rural, mountainous area, and over-the-air reception is impossible. The house is a second/ weekend home, and I cannot justify the expenditure of $45+ per month for what might amount to 5 hours of cable viewing per week. My experience with the TV is therefore only via DVD. I have a run-of-the-mill Sony progressive scan DVD player, and with that, the resultant picture quality is excellent. I get \"Wow's\" from the neighbors.  I originally had the video output running through an older DVD player, and bumping up to a progressive scan made a positive difference in picture quality. The DVD audio runs through the surround system, so I cannot speak to the quality of the audio from the TV itself (and with movie soundtracks, who is NOT listening to their surround system?).  Given the picture quality that 480i DVD provides, I can only imagine what HDTV looks like.With that said, I again state the value of the TV is great. The on-screen menu is terrific. The manual did not come with the TV, and until I downloaded it from the web, I had to make do and set the TV up without it.  No problem. The menus are logical and have quite a level of descriptive depth to them, which is a godsend. The remote control is fine. I wish the button names lit up and were a tad bigger, but it is reasonably operable as is.  The manual, by the way, is written clearly, and in English, by someone writing in their native language.  Another kudo!  I have read reviews that speak to black levels in the set not being as good as they should be, colors being a tad off, and a noisy fan. In my showroom side by side comparison, this picture excelled, and I have not been in any way disappointed with it at home. Less-than-black blacks, and colors that are off according to sophisticated test DVDs do not detract from my own low-tech sensors: my eyes.  I also have not witnessed any blurring, rainbow or motion-related problems that some DLP sets have.While I chose to live dangerously and not take the \"insurance policy\" the store tried to sell me, I did some research on the web and bought a replacement lamp for the set. The salesperson made a strong point that the lamp in any DLP set WILL burn out. The likelihood of it burning out sooner in this floor model is even greater, so I hedged my bet by getting two, just in case.  I would rather have the spares (around $200), and piece of mind when the lamp inevitably fails.  If something larger craps out, e.g. the light engine (> $900), then I guess I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.Even as I contemplate bringing a widescreen TV into my \"main\" home, I find the combination of picture quality and lower price that the RCA DLP offers is tough to beat.  I have looked at the competition, and the price difference to bump up to other manufacturers becomes difficult to reconcile.","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

It truly looks like you are looking out a window when viewing HD channels. Standard definition channels look fine, also.

{"Title":"Excellent for viewing DVDs","Author":"Cedric's Mom","ReviewID":"R2O7NL8964NRJH","Overall":"good","Content":"I wanted to rave about this monitor as much as most other folks on this site, but I must say, I was not impressed with the Olevia when I first took it out of the box, connected it, and turned on the TV.  I kept checking the sound on every channel to see if it said mono, because it sure didn't sound like stereo to me.  I went through both manuals, trying to find some adjustment I could make to improve the picture and the sound.  I even went out and bought the suggested S video cable, but I couldn't see any difference in the picture once I plugged it in.But all that changed as soon as I popped in my Batman Begins DVD.Wow.  This monitor is the bomb.  The sound is indeed stereo with rich tones and good separation.  The picture is great with fantastic resolution, more than I hoped for.I wish that the print in the user's manual were actually large enough for me to read with my 40+ year old eyes and that the onscreen menu were easier to maneuver.  But it's clear to me that this thing was designed for watching DVDs in widescreen and at that, it absolutely excels.  TV people look a bit squat and the sound is more like flat mono than stereo.  Who needs television anyway?  If you use this equipment for watching DVDs only, it will be well worth the price you paid for it.  I have no complaints with it now.","Date":"October 31, 2005"}

{"Title":"Best 26\" LCD HDTV ? Maybe ......","Author":"Sean","ReviewID":"R77AGS18EHA85","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, this is probably a good \"value\" considering it's currently low price point ($699-$799 + Rebates), and it has a decent array of inputs, and it comes right out of the box ready to go (stand is already attached). but that's where it all comes to a subtle stop.I'll explain. After a lightning storm took out a 5 year old analog 32\" 'square' TV, i said \"yep, it's time for another widescreen HDTV\" . We own a 55\" Hitachi Ultravision Projection and it has awesome written all over it. Maybe I set my expectation a little high on the LCD, even though I never expected an LCD to look near as good as the Hitachi.My direction was pointing to CRT (conventional picture tube) Widescreens. 30\" from Sony (KVH-30hs420), Panasonic (Tau), Toshiba (30hf85) and Philips (30pw911od). Where this is where I wish I hand ended up, instead of beganLCD are incapable of reproducing images as clear as CRT's . period.there's just something about LCD's that have always bugged me. the Black's are never 'black' , action creates artifacting (blocks of pixels), graphic and text looks overprocessed. This Olevia has some of those (but not all) and a few of its own)Pros and Cons------------Pros :Nice footprint30 lbs - easily mountable on a wallInputs for days : VGA / DVI / Component x2 / S-Video x 2 / Composite x 2Clean and usable interfacethe new IDEA technology works ... sortaHD broadcasts look great but not awesomehooked up a Dell laptop via VGA and it looked real nice, but....Cons :VGA is locked at 16:9Nice footprint , but the foot isn't removable (so I've read)would look nice on a wall, if you could remove the stand (foot)the inputs are nice to have lots of, anything Composite (Yellow) is sure to look badthe added EQ and Surround modes are nifty, but some of the Surrounds are uselessthe remote is too simple, but it does allow you to access everything (which isn't much)-except you cannot change aspect ratio with remotenon-HD Letterboxed programs are tiny. the letterboxing bars are almost as big as the imagethere is a line of time code viweable at the top of the screen.-there is no way of stretching it out-the only way to change aspects is to go into the menu-there should be an \"Aspect\" button on the remote-in the video menu there are options to adjust the screen vertically and horizontally-these options are \"shaded\" and are not accessible by the user. VGA use only - that sux15:9 is an awkward ratio. Some say you can't notice it, but you can - if you look-16:9 mode effectively crops 1/2 inch of both the top and bottom of the screenIDEA technology kinda does what it says, but I didn't see it as dramatic as it's shownThere is no way to stretch out a 4:3 image to 16:9-your aspect options are FULL /4:3/ 16:9 / Panoramic-what I had to do was go into a secret menu on my Motorola Cable Box-when asks : 4:3 Override ? - you have to select STRETCH. I had override set to 480pSettings from the factory need adjusting-if you are unfamiliar with adjusting video you might get an undesirable pictureFinal Thoughts -I wanted to like this LCD. I thought maybe someone had finally got an LCD to look good with TV broadcasts, and while Syntax-Olevia is probably doing a better job then anyone else in the range, they still haven't got it where an A/V enthusiast is going to be pleased with the final results.Pictures are still to 'washed' for my liking, and watching any action or sports has got to be a struggle. Static or normal images look great, but once things start to move or speed up they lose it.Using my little cable box trick (which everyone should now) solves some problems but complicates others. 1st -the trick. with your cable box OFF, select MENU on the front of the box (not the remote), you should get a grey tech screen. it'll ask you the display type and 480i override options as well as Component outputI've met quite a few people who had their component outs to 480i and the screen type to 4:3 , whic would solve some issues.Type - 16:9Output - 1080i (or 720p)480i Override - StretchBut to this point, I cannot remove the line of code at the top of the screen----called Syntax Support (1-888-Syntax-8) nice quick response \"We usually only see that w/ DVI connections\"so why do i see it on Component ? \"Maybe it's the cable box\"So, i checked some channels. It seems that once you get passed chanel 70 the line goes away, which is about where the DigiCable starts.too bad we have SciFi , Spike, Comedy, Nickelodeon, etc.. under that thresholdi'm also not encouraged by this being a DVI observed anamolyI'm going to give this monitor 1 week. If I haven't figured it out, it's going backwhich will be a shame because I really wanted to like this settoo bad I started out looking at CRT's whose images are much sharperbut for someone who just has to have there TV mounted on a wallor wants both a TV and a PC monitor, they won't find a better LCD at a better pricePaid - $699 w/$100 Rebate = ($599) September 1, 2005well worth the money. Syntax makes a quality product in the Olevia lineI started to give this a 3, but I will give it a 4 and consider that the code line is a product of the Cable Box, however, if you can adjust picture orientation in VGA, you should be able to do the same in DVI and ComponentI'll also take into account that LCD's aren't capable of being as clear as CRT. Having said that, this is one of the better pictures I've ever seen on an LCD; and by far the best for $700","Date":"August 31, 2005"}
{"Title":"I'm pleased with it!","Author":"AbeStreet","ReviewID":"R2ISRBU15V3C91","Overall":"good","Content":"The purchase of the LT26HVE 26 represented our families first venture into the world of flat screen television.  We have, over the past few years, explored the flat screen market and always found the price of a nice sized television to be the biggest obstacle.  Well, when we found this television for below $700 we figured now was the time to take the plunge.  We were concerned about purchasing a television from a company we had never heard of until the sales rep explained to us why this set was as good as many name brand televisions.  The sales rep actually took the time to point out the pros and cons.  I usually don't pay much attention to greedy sales reps, but this guy really seemed more concerned with making sure we understood what we were purchasing than with making sure we purchased any old television.Anyway, here are a list of the pro's and cons.Pros1. Light weight.  I usually get a good work out hauling around our 27 inch and 32 inch tube televisions, by comparison, the  LT26HVE 26 seemed as light as a feather.  My lower back loves the television more than the rest of my body.2. Easy hook up.  Like many people I shun reading the manuals, at least with this television I didn't need it for the installation of the various cables.3. The on screen menu options are fairly easy to understand and follow.4. The DVD picture is good.  Our cable pictures are about the same as our tube pictures.  We don't have HDTV yet and so I can't blame the television for not improving our cable image.5. I'm pleased with the sound.  I should mention that this television is in our bedroom and so we don't play it with the volume up that loud.6. I don't want to beat a dead horse but the price is really good.  I guess I'm a little cheap, because it's going to take one heck of salesmen to get me to spend a Grand or more on a television.7. The picture is still pretty clear when not viewing the screen while directly in front of it.8. This television comes equipped to handle just about any kind of connection you may have.  I doubt I'll use the television for a computer monitor or to play games on but at least I have the option.  It's the first television I've been able to use with an S Cable connection for the DVD player.Cons1. Screen burn out may be a problem.  I prefer to watch shows and movies that are shown in the 4:3 aspect ratio in that ratio.  I don't like stretching the image to accommodate a wider aspect ratio.  I've been warned that the reduced image may cause the cropping lines to be burned into the screen over time.  I guess some newer televisions come with a feature that slowly shifts the cropped screen from side to side so that screen burnout can be avoided.  I don't believe this television has that feature.2. There is no \"Sleep\" function on the remote.  For me this is a big \"con.\"  I'm used to hopping into bed and tapping the sleep button to set the television to shut off within a half hour.  Now I have to flip through the menu options and set the television to shut off at a specific time.  I also have to adjust the time to 24 hour (military) time.  Seems kind of slow and outdated to me.  I haven't purchased a television within the last fifteen years that didn't have a \"Sleep\" button.3. Call me crazy but I kind of like a tube picture.  I know LCD's are all the rage these days but I think my tube televisions are richer in color than LCD's?  Also, my eyes get a little sore after staring at this LCD.  It may just be me but I think LCD's are harder on the eyes.In the end this television has more pros than cons.  We are considering purchasing a 32 inch model for our downstairs family room.","Date":"February 23, 2006"}

SD is usually unwatchable on a highdef screen.  I have watched and enjoyed quite a few baseball games on this set.Sound:The speakers that are part of the TV have adequate sound,  I don't have it hooked up to a home theater.XBOX:I had to tweak the contrast/brightness but afterwards it looks and plays great.  I am not seeing any streaking/blurring.  I am playing using the component input.","Date":"June 22, 2005"}
{"Title":"A solid choice","Author":"T. MacDonald","ReviewID":"R2ZFQEV3W6ZOW9","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this LCD TV after considering many conventional TV's in the $500-700 range.  My main concern with \"tube\" TV's ultimately was space, and so I researched some less-expensive LCD's and settled on the 26\" Olevia.I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture, particularly in HDTV.  Now I'm no expert regarding the performance of various comparable units, but I've found this TV to more than satisfy my goals of upgrading my modest home entertainment system without breaking my budget.My only negative comment relates to sound quality, which I consider fair to poor. Regardless,  I am running sound through my home entertainment system so that issue is irrelevant for me, but possibly not for others.One suggestion, if you go comparison shopping at big box stores like Best Buy you are likely to be drawn to 32\" and larger LCD TV's.  The 26\" models seem tiny by comparison in such large space, but they are more than adequate for most rooms--take a deep breath and avoid over-buying for your needs.","Date":"December 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"Had to return it - two major problems","Author":"Hans Loedolff","ReviewID":"R2U10HL67JYJ3P","Overall":"good","Content":"Regretfully, I was not able to keep this TV.  I only have a standard cable connection and when I hooked this TV up to it using the antenna connection, I had the following problems:-The color depth would sometimes diminish, i.e., the picture would only have a couple of shades of each color and also appear grainy.-As I understood the manual, when the input is standard 4:3 (as I get through my cable), then selecting 16:9 would zoom in, preserving the aspect ration.  Unfortunately the 16:9 did not preserve the aspect ration, but stretched the image horizontally, leaving blank lines above and below the picture.  It behaved the same as the \"panoramic\" mode.I figured it wasn't worth the headache to resolve problems since I could just go back to my old 25\" tube TV and not have any problems - a clear picture with great color all the time, and no aspect ratio distortion.I did not hook it up to my DVD player or an HDTV receiver.  Hence I was using the TV for something other than it's ideal purpose.I loved the design and the weight, and regret that the image problems forced me to return the TV!","Date":"September 2, 2005"}
{"Title":"Can't beat the price","Author":"Tyler March","ReviewID":"R3EJTOPF1Z1VSO","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV over a month ago and I agree with most everyone who says you can't beat the quality for the price. Just don't expect this TV to look great unless you have an HD cable box.I have nothing new to add, but I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the blue light on the power button. The light can be bright and the TV's in our bedroom which made it hard to sleep, so what I did was take a tiny strip of black electrical tape and covered the tip of the power button. Problem solved, no more blue light. The strip of tape is tiny and you can't even see it because everything is black anyway. Don't let the light keep you from buying this TV because it's easy to fix like I did, and you won't find a better price on an LCD TV of this quality and size.Also, people here are saying this TV doesn't work with a universal remote. Not true. All you have to do is enter the code for RCA, YAMAHA, LG, or Philips television (it's posted on their web site). I tried it with my Sony DVD player remote and got it to work with the RCA code.","Date":"December 29, 2005"}
{"Title":"WAY TO GO SYNTAX!!!!!","Author":"Leigh C. Kirsten","ReviewID":"RZ80B2CISDDOA","Overall":"good","Content":"Did quite a bit of research on LCD and Plasma TVs.  Wanted to be able to use as a computer monitor also.  Believe me, anyone into electronics and specs and having half normal intelligence on using settings can get this TV to work beautifully!!!  Seeing the prices on other LCDs, plasmas and \"rear projection\" TVs, a bit of advise - save your money and be confident in purchasing this \"very\" reasonably priced Syntax Olevia.  Yes, the company has only been in business for a couple of years, but doing research, they are now the 3rd highest rated in LCDs. Reviews in many electronics magazines recommend highly.  Pretty good for a new company!  As for using for a monitor - only a 6 ft. cable comes with the set.  Make sure you spend the extra money and invest into a high-end cable, e.g. the Belkin Pro Series High Integrity VGA/SVGA replacement monitor cable.  Try not to use an extension - go for a m/m replacement cable.  Most stores, e.g. Staples, etc. do not know lower end cables are not recommended for monitors larger then 17-19\". This High Integrity is used for larger TV/Monitors - over 17-19\".  As for adding speakers, etc., again - use high-end cables!  Regarding remote - programmed my cable remote to run the system.  Only need Syntax remote to adjust settings.  Can program ANY remote to control this LCD.  Am debating whether to purchase another, maybe larger, before pricing goes up.  Syntax knows they have a GOOD PRODUCT.  You won't be sorry.  Only reason so reasonably priced is to get their product out there to show what they've got.  Good strategy!  Another bit of info - worked with Bose since their inception.  If you respect the Bose systems, take the advise from someone who's worked with electronics engineers since the 1960's.  Nice product Syntax!!!!!!!!!","Date":"August 12, 2005"}
{"Title":"Serious Screen Real Estate for the Price","Author":"MW","ReviewID":"R2928NJR68Z6UU","Overall":"good","Content":"Syntax is a fantastic company if you are looking for an LCD on a budget.  My logic is this: if all LCDs have a life to them, then why drop loads of money on something that you know will eventually die?  Not a cent will be wasted on this TV - if you can stand a few minor inconveniences.  For one thing, if you have the backlight set to anything below 100%, the TV makes a buzzing, humming sound (which is mostly drowned out by the fan on my HTPC :-P).  The remote that I got likes to act up as well - sometimes it works, other times it doesn't.  The contrast is excellent, although the blacks aren't really pure black, and you can have some wicked backlight patterns if you don't adjust your settings properly.  If you don't know much about LCDs, you may want to purchase another TV, but if you're a geek (like me), this TV is for you.  I hope this review helped!

{"Title":"Excellent Value for TV or Monitor","Author":"Robert","ReviewID":"R3NC5L4W9CJBF4","Overall":"good","Content":"I received the LT26HVE with plans to use it as a big desktop monitor.  I'm used to a big monitor since I burned out my 6-year-old 21\" CRT.  I was a little worried about how this would perform based upon some of the reviews but am happy to report that it works excellently in practice. I have two computers connected, one with the DVI port and one with the VGA port. I've set both graphics cards to run at the native 1280 x 768 resolution with excellent results. The display will actually interpolate a number of resolutions (from 640x480 to 1280x1280). At first I was concerned that the VGA output was cut-off at one side, but after reading the manual discovered that the \"Auto\" button on the remote automatically detects the extents of the video input and adjusts the display in a snap.There are a myriad of options for personalizing the display and color temperatures to your tastes.  HD Broadcast output looks outstanding.A couple things detract from this, but aren't really big negatives because of the economical price.  These are the somewhat odd (15:9) aspect ratio which makes very narrow letterboxing around standard HDTV or WS movie content. The second thing is the desktop stand which seems like it could be a little sturdier (metal instead of plastic would have been nice).","Date":"July 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great LCD","Author":"Tobin T. Bradley \"fuzzytolerance\"","ReviewID":"RKCANLGFEDTM1","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this LCD for a couple of weeks, and I have to say it has done everything I could throw at it extremely well.I had it running straight coax cable, which yields a fair picture (which is what I get generally from straight-up cable).  Running from the S-video off of an Adelphia cable box gives a noticably better picture.  I would rate the SV output from the cable box as very good to excellent (probalby depending on whether the signal from the box is true digital or analog converted to digital).  As I don't have HD from cable yet, I can't comment on that.I do, however, have HD 1080i coming from my Xbox (component video HD adapter), and that looks spectacular.  I think there were a couple of times in Doom III where I physically ducked.  Gaming with this thing is excellent.I'm also running the VGA output from my PC in to it at 1280x768 (what it does natively - if you do other resolutions, expect some compression/expansion and some loss in picture quality).  It looks every bit as good as the Dell 17\" LCD it was replacing, and a heck of a lot bigger to boot (26\" at 1280x768 is freaking huge).DVD's look great too.  I've run s-video from my cheap DVD player, and it looked great, and I've played DVD's on my computer fullscreen and it looked great as well.  I'd be interested to see if one of those up-converting DVD players make any difference, but as it is DVD's look teriffic.The PIP options are very nice.  You can take any of the inputs and PIP them, so you can have your computer running and TV in a window or vice versa.  You can also do a split screen, though both sides will be a bit compressed, so don't expect great picture quality there.The only knock I would give it is the remote is a bit spartan.  You have to do a lot of toggling around to do some things they could have made a button for.  For example, to get the PIP you want you may have to hit the View button several times and the Swap button once or twice.  Rather than having a button for each AV input, you pull up a menu on the screen and toggle around for a bit to change sources.Despite the remote, for everything it does extremely well, the vast array of inputs, and the overall design and picture quality, I have to give it five stars.  If it were over $1k, I'd knock it a star for the little things, but for well under $700 with rebates it's a steal in my opinion.","Date":"September 12, 2005"}

The HD content was immaculate, the analog was surprisingly good, and the composite was very grainy, as I expected. The \"sleep\" feature on the tv is more complicated than it should be and requires the user to scroll through a couple of menus to get to (there is no button on the remote). The tv arrived packaged very well, and setup was a no-brainer. The only issue I've had so far is that the tv does not repsond to the remote for the first minute after it is turned on.

This is ok in some environments, but in my pitch-black bedroom, the light had to be covered up (easy with a piece of electrical tape).-Not a common manufactuerer so universal remotes are a little harder to program.

It will also serve as a television. The picture is absolutely beautiful. I didn't have to change any picture settings out of the box. GTA:SA supports this monitor's native resolution. Playing GTA and Halo for PC I have not noticed any \"ghosting\" and picture quality is impeccable. Having a screen this big in front of you to play makes you feel as though you are really in the games. Only complaint I have is that this venerable wall of light and color is a good deal bigger than it appears to be in the pictures. If you plan to use this as a monitor, be sure you can set it back a few feet on your desk. It does produce some heat if it is kept too close. I doubt I will ever be able to use a small monitor again. DVD playback is excellent. It is great to finally be rid of those dreaded \"black bars\" around all of my widescreen DVD's.  One other word of advice: this TV does require about four seconds of warm-up time before it will turn on, the same thing applies when switching PIP windows, there is a several second delay while the TV processes switching the two pictures. This is normal.","Date":"July 22, 2005"}

The light leak I'm talking about is bright white in the corners with the white diffusing over at least an inch square in each corner.  This is noticeable when viewing a dvd that has a wider aspect ratio, thus giving the black bars on top and bottom.  Is anyone else seeing this problem?

I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary, I just wanted an easy to view TV that didn't take up the space of a refrigerator.WOW! the picture is fabulous! Just watching one thing on this TV will immediately ruin your experience of a \"normal\" TV. After watching a few things on this TV, I had to immediately order one for home. We got the 32\" and love it just as much. The speakers are not fabulous, but that is easily remedied with an inexpensive surround sound system. It even comes with an attachment to plug in to your computer (not that I have tried this yet), which seems pretty cool.Of course, the best thing about this TV is the price. It is easily 2/3 the price of \"name brand\" flat screens. I was a little nervous about buying an \"off-brand\" TV, but the quality of this unit is obvious. I guess they save money by not having the expensive advertising campaigns like the other brands.Now my mother-in-law wants one -- she had been looking at the $2000+ units at the big electronic stores and had to see this one to believe that a decent HD TV could be had for under $1000.It is simple to install -- comes out of the box with the feet installed -- just plug in your components into the clearly labeled slots and away you go!","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

It lacks the typical control functions of a PC monitor, such as screen adjustments, making it useless to us where we had planned to use it as a monitor on a gaming PC.  Video games showed distorted pictures and/or some of the playable screen and controls off the edge of the screen.  While the aspect ratio can be changed in TV mode, for some reason, it cannot be changed in VGA mode, so we couldn't correct this.  We will end up using it as a DVD display for the kids instead.

McGuire","ReviewID":"R23KPQ47O320P9","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this LCD HDTV for about $455 on sale, and I love the picture for the price!  Without reviewing with a bunch of technical jargon, I can tell you the audio on this tv is terrible. I even tried listening through headphones only, and the sound still sounded like the sound was coming from a tin can. I bought an amp receiver and the sound is much improved. DVD look great, especially if you have a progessive scan unit, and HDTV reception is clear, even for fast moving basketball games. Use monster cables. If your cable or sat company wired you, you probably already have fast speed coaxial wires anyway. Overall, I love it... The widescreen makes it look bigger than a 26!","Date":"February 9, 2008"}

Jaeger \"Flick Fan\"","ReviewID":"RWSWFH7K3OY1K","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this to replace my NEC 17\" LCD Monitor which I use for both TV and computer use(ATI All-in-Wonder TV/Video card in the computer) The NEC has about twice the native resolution as this unit and the image is a knockout, though small. When used as a computer monitor/web browser the Olevia is borderline. I had to increase the type size about double to avoid ragged edges and reading difficulty. This makes each web page full screen width and thus there is a great deal of scrolling to see each page. Even at this size I miss the type resolution of the NEC. The story is the same for use as a TV with an analog signal - I miss the resolution of the NEC but like the screen size of the Olevia.Then I play DVDs the story is different - the resolution and image quality are quite good, especially for the price. Since this is the quality I will get when all the broadcasters complete thier conversion to digital transmission, all will be well. It is difficult to get the skin tone right (too much red, as mentioned elsewhere) though I eventually did get it too an acceptable level. I have decided to keep this and sell the NEC.","Date":"June 25, 2005"}

I will admit that I was pulled in by the price and the reviews however it's not all it's cracked up to be. Out the box I found the picture and the sound to be rather poor compared to my Zenith Tube TV (which is about 6 or 7 years old I might add). After some playing around with the settings, I was able to improve the sound quality to a suitable level. The picture quality however was a different story. On full, 16:9, and panoramic the picture gets stretched. It only looks normal on 4:3 and even then the picture quality stays the same. The picture looks a bit \"washed out\" and doesn't perform well with fast moving images. I really wanted to like this TV. If not for the price then for the looks but after sitting in front of it for a few hours and playing some games on it, I have to send it back and use my old Tube TV till I find a new one...I gave it a 3 star rating only because it's still an ok TV for someone who just wants a TV.

I had been searching for a flat-screen TV that was reasonably-priced and had a good, sharp picture.  I compared this TV in a store to several others in its price range.  This was the clear winner.  It has a beautiful picture and great sound. (I am pleased that my TV has no dead pixels, either.)This is a monitor, not a TV, so you do need a cable box.  I have a digital HD box through Adelphia cable.  The HD channels on this TV are outstanding.  The persons on screen might as well be standing in front of you.  I have never tried to use this as a computer monitor, so I cannot speak to how it would work, but it is a wonderful TV.  And, despite Westinghouse's reputation for having bad remotes, the remote control on this TV works well.  It is very easy to switch from HDTV to regular TV.All in all, I am delighted.  My only regret is not having bought a larger Westinghouse TV -- but that would have meant paying much more!","Date":"February 7, 2006"}
{"Title":"Other reviewers don't do it justice","Author":"Agata","ReviewID":"R1VP5F5I17MFB8","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased this TV, and I am very pleased with it. I did not expect fancy features and surround-like sound, but a basic LCD TV that was inexpensive and expandable. I actually like the fact that it doesn't have a built-in HDTV tuner - that lets the price stay low (I will call up my cable company to upgrade to HDTV in a few days). Without HDTV, the picture quality isn't the best when you're close up, but with HDTV (as I saw in the store) it's just as great as the more expensive brands. The salesman told me how customers come back and complain about the picture quality, but this kind of TV is made to be used with HDTV (evident with the display model they had). The sound isn't bad - it's good enough for this price (for reviewers who complain about this - you get what you pay for, and if you want better sound quality, go for a more expensive model). My set has no dead pixels at all, and unlike what others said, the remote works fine. The menu can get a bit confusing to use, but it's manageable. The documentation is minimal, but you can probably find more info on it online. Overall, I am very happy for finding an LCD for such a low price (I went to J&R; for it - great service, the set is priced at $799.99 in store and $699.99 on their site, they were happy to give it to me for the online price). I recommend it for people who really want an LCD but can't afford one over $1,000. I'm looking forward to getting HDTV, and enjoying years with this LCD TV.","Date":"May 8, 2006"}

They're designed to be used with a stereo or surround sound system.I am updating this review today, Jan 1, 2013 to indicate that approx 1 yr ago every time the tv was turned on, the screen wouldn't come on for a few minutes.  As time went on it got worse (after a few minutes of the screen being on, it would go black) so I just left it on.  About 4 months ago, a big dark spot (about the diameter of a soda can) appeared in the upper left corner.  About 1.5 mos ago, the tv died completely.

After some initial research last year, decided to waited another year to let the LCD technology mature and HDMI technology become common on TVs.This past 4 months, I looked at Sony 3LCD TVs and Toshiba DLP TVs very closely. Sony has good picture but did not have picture-in-picture in this years models and styling looked decades old. Toshiba's 1080P TV was very good with a ton of inputs and comparable pricing but somehow I did not feel comfortable with the Toshiba brand. My research indicated that almost all major brands have good picutre quality so the deciding factor came down to other features like inputs, pip and brandname. The picture quality in Best Buy and circuit city did not look close to what I get at home with a progressive scan DVD. For some reason, the stores want to sell Sonys more than anything else so they hookup Sony with best input and cables and leave Panasonic with ordinary cables making it look inferior.I have been a Sony or Panasonic brand customer so I decided to buy a Panasonic. For some reason, Panasonic does not have many LCD projection models and this was the only newer one in the 55+inch range. I was very impressed with the features ( sleek design, pip, inputs, sd card reader ) and price.I am an avid internet shopper but for reason did not feel comfortable making such a huge purchase online but the price difference between bricks and mortar shops to internet shops like Amazon compelled me to take a chance. The TV was delivered in perfect condition and they even set it up in the room of my choice. The TV design looked much better at home ( up close ) than in stores. It weighs a lot less than my old 27inch tube TV.HD Picture:I hooked a $20 HD antenna to the TV and boy, was I impressed with the picutre quality? Local HD channels looked lifelike. I just could not believe my eyes. This is using a co-axial cable and NOT HDMI. I am glad I did not fork over a fortunate for a Plasma TV because the HD picture quality is just as good as that of a plasma TV.DVD Picture:Make sure you get a Progressive Scan DVD player to enjoy good quality movies. The quality won't be as good as HD but it is very good. I used component video cables to connect my DVD player. I could see significant difference in picture quality between a regular DVD player with composite cables and a progressive scan DVD player with component cables.SD Picture:SD picture ( Dish network ) quality is more than satisfactory. It is not as good as my old tube TV but that is expected and I am very happy with the quality. There is even a significant difference in picture when connected using S-Video or composite cables. I just wish there was an additional co-axial cable input so that I can hook both the antenna and the dish receiver using co-ax cables.For now, I have not decided whether to upgrade to HD receiver from dish or wait because I heard that the output from dish network HD receiver is something like 480p and there are not a lot of HD channels available outside of local channels.I am sitting about 10-15 feet from the TV. I do not notice a lot of grainy pixels from less than 10 feet also although it is not wise to sit that close. HD picture look great from any distance.The remote is very easy to use. The SD card reader is handy although I noticed that it is better to view your picture on a laptop than on a TV. It is just painfully slow on a TV when compared to a computer. The SD card reader can be useful when you don't have a computer(laptop) handy.I have not used the PC input yet. I don't intend to use a 61 inch screen as a my PC input anyways.The TV does not look big in my family room as I suspected. The TV is much smaller than a 60inch Sony model and looks 100times better. It is a great upgrade for me and the details I could notice on this TV are stunning. As I said before, I love the HD picture on this TV. I watched a Pistons game the other day in HD and it was better than being in the stadium :) The detail on the big screen was just awesome. I watched the SuperBowl on ABC in HD with digital audio connected to my Bose surround system and it was simply a superb experience. HD picture is just as good as on a Plasma TV.Overall, this is a great TV. I am glad I purchased this over Sony.","Date":"February 8, 2006"}

With so many options available (plasma, DLP, LCD, etc.), buying a TV can be a head-splitting task. However, after considering what I want out of a big screen TV as well as my budget, I finally decided that this TV is the way to go. One drawbacks I read with LCD projection TVs is the \"screen door effect\" which is really obvious if you are sitting close to the TV. Since I'm at a comfortable distance away from the TV, I don't see this at all. Overall, the picture quality is awesome. I have yet to subscribe to HDTV (Charter Communications has a waiting list...sheesh!)...but the picture is excellent for standard TV reception. The picture is even better with DVDs and games (I have hooked up a Gamecube and PS2 to this). I think one of the reviewers below mentioned the price of the stand...yes, it is somewhat pricey...but you don't really much of an option since the manual states that this is the stand they recommend for the TV...and if you're putting down this much money on a TV, it's best to spend a little extra to ensure that the whole thing doesn't topple over. The Panasonic stand comes with features to prevent the TV from tipping over...or you can also chain the TV to the wall (I swear...this is in the manual). So if you're looking for a nice big screen TV for a reasonable price, this TV is the way to go.","Date":"March 22, 2006"}

I got the run around for 2 months from east cost retailers and finally found one at a local dealer , ended up paying 1000 dollars more but at least its sitting in my living room all hooked up and running. Pay the extra money for the 500u over the panasonic 50px. It has more features and the stand looks much better. Dont be fooled into paying 3000 or so for another 50\" HD plasma! Good luck finding one. Andersons TV in Dublin, Ca has 2 left in stock.","Date":"October 1, 2005"}
{"Title":"Panasonic TH50PX500 vs Samsung HP-R5072","Author":"Steve","ReviewID":"R385OEJTN2DAEB","Overall":"good","Content":"Initally purchased the Panasonic from Amazon.  I received it damaged, so I had to send it back.  They didn't have any left in stock, so I decided to purchase a 50\" plasma from a local dealer.  None of the locals had the Panasonic that I wanted, so I went with the Samsung HP-R5072.  I had the Samsung for 20 days before I returned it and purchased the Panasonic TH50PX500.All-in-all, the picture on the Samsung had a good picture, but it did not have near the picture clarity and color vibrance that the Panasonic has.  Additionally, this Samsung model has and \"electronic program guide\" - not to be confused withe the \"TV GUIDE\" version.  Needless to say, the Samsung version did not work and requires each channel to transit their program information and that just does not happen.  The Panasonic TH50PX500 does have the \"TV Guide\" version and it worked great.  Finally, the split screen cabability and integration capability with other Panasonic products put the Panasonic over the top when compared to the Samsung.  One last thing, the Samsung remote is very minimal as far as capability goes.  Panasonic has this beat hands down.","Date":"September 29, 2005"}

The Consummer Reports review sent me to the stores. I looked at every plasma set I could find and when I could watched them next to LCD and projection HD models. Every one looked good, the 500U looked better. Good quality DVD (Superbit Lawarence of Arabia or the Fifth Element for example) look terrific at 480P via component or HDMI inputs. Good as it was out of the box I tried a video tuneup disc and both DVD and HD movies were impressively close to film. and I bought locally at a specialty store so even with a discount from the general retail price in this area, delivery and painless setup were included. That is some thing to consider if you buy. The set weighs 114lbs. My wife gave my a hard time over the price, but the set looks good and is slim enough even with out a wall mount to sit tight against the wall.Negatives:Standard Def cable is not as good as on a CRT, especially if streched, but it is very acceptable six or eight feet back.

You can't NOT watch it - not to mention the sports programming on the other over the air channels. I feed the analog cable signal thru my Replay TV. Looks great.For some reason I wasn't recieving the FOX HD channel. Was advised to simply reprogram all the channels and it came right back up.If you force me to find something to quibble about, here goes. I wish the remote had a CC button.

I did some extensive research on this model and virtually all the reviews were highly positive.  This Panasonic has the 8th generation plasma panel which is currently the state of the art.  To use an automotive analogy, \"You have a high end 8 cylinder engine running under the hood\".It really makes a difference, the blacks are deep in saturation and the colors are vibrant.  HD TV looks incredible on this panel and regular broadcasts are well defined. DVD's look great, so when HD-DVD comes out I'm sure the video will be awesome, you get very spoiled to the HD feeds after a while.  Mitsubishi and Pioneer both have equally high-end plasmas which rival this Panasonic, but there price is not in the same ballpark.

{"Title":"My first Plasma","Author":"J. Ibanez","ReviewID":"R126HD2YPPBTKX","Overall":"good","Content":"Three years ago, I bought my first big screen (sony 57\" rear projection HDTV).  A 34\" plasma at the time was probably worth the same price, so plasmas were never an option.  But now comparing the two types of technologies, plasma has improved so much and prices have dropped considerably.From what the salesman told me, this model runs off the 8th generation of plasma televisions, which is currently the latest technology.  Panasonic also slightly increases its blue pixels, which supposedly gives certain images a better feeling.  Also, when comparing multiple plasmas in the store, the black levels came out darker than on other tvs, such as while we comparing the letterboxes off the same source.  The only reason I did not buy from him was because they did not carry the 500U model, just the 50U.There was one store that had a 42\" and a 50\" 50U model side by side.  There I couldn't tell a difference in size, so if price was a factor I think a 42\" would have suited me just fine.The first thing I fired up on this TV was my Xbox with the component connections.  Of course the TV was set to vivid initially, but the colors were just awesome.Second was a Toshiba DVD player with up conversion through the HDMI interface.  Looks great but I can't wait for HD-DVD or Blu-ray to make its way to the market.I'm still trying to get a strong OTA signal but have many obstacles in my way.  I'll probably defer to Directv's HD service.I've also been looking up wall mounts for this 120 lbs monster (which by the way took two people take out of the box and secure on top of my table).  Sanus is currently my front runner on wall mounts, but considering its overall weight I might reconsider just a decent tabletop.I'd recommend this TV for the plasma users out there.","Date":"November 26, 2005"}
{"Title":"Quality Picture at a bargain price...","Author":"anzicco","ReviewID":"RDK6F9UT1H95N","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall, I am very pleased with the quality of the picture on this TV set. I have it hooked up with an HDMI cable connected to Comcast's (Motorola) DVR box.  Comcast has several \"HD\" broadcast stations, although true HD programming is still very limited.  I would suggest you program your own preferences (called MEMORY) rather than use one of the preset Toshiba setups which are either too bright (Sports & Movie) or too dark (Normal)  I have my preferences set to levels between the Movie and Normal settings and find that I do not have to change them too often.  I also have set resolution to 1080i, but will sometimes switch it to 540p on some analog stations or older programs as the interlace scan lines are sometimes very obvious and progressive scan works better.  Amazon claims in the product description that this set includes 2-tuner PIP, but I do not believe it does as there is nothing in the documentation that references this, nor do I see any PIP button on the remote or in the menu setup.**** UPDATE*****  I checked with Toshiba customer service and was informed that 2 Tuner PIP IS NOT A FEATURE on this TV set!!!  There are not 2 Tuners, nor is there any PIP!!!  They also informed me the set is manufactured by TOSHIBA in the USA and not Orion as some reviewers have suggested!*******While overall, I have a positive view of this set, there are some drawbacks:The 4 different theater-modes for the picture on analog/normal stations really distort the picture and/or cut off the top and bottom.  Full screen mode keeps all of the data at the top and bottom but people tend to have fat squishy faces.The TV does NOT have a Menu button on the set...so if you lose or break the remote control, you are stuck...there is no other way to choose source, picture size/quality, or other settings!  This is a major drawback!The Remote Control that comes with the set is supposed to be a universal remote, but it has no code for the Motorola box comcast uses, nor does it have any buttons for DVR controls, so it is necessary to keep 2 remotes around.I would also STRONGLY recommend you try to get this at a local store with their own delivery company.  The company Amazon used for my delivery was horrible.  I was NEVER directly contacted by the company when my set arrived in their warehouse.  I had to make a toll call 4 different times to finally get delivery over a week after the warehouse received it from Amazon, and 13 days After I ordered it from Amazon.com.  Amazon claims that the \"premium delivery service\" they use, for which you add $100 to the price, \"use protective equipment such as floor mats and doorjamb padding to prevent damage\"  There was no evidence of this when they made my delivery, and one of the two people sent was an older gentleman who had a great deal of trouble lifting the merchandise, almost dropping it a couple of times on the way up the stairs. They also DO NOT set up the TV for you.  They will plug it in and hand you the remote, and that's it.  If you do not know anything about hooking up, make sure you get it from a dealer who provides a set up service. Amazon also does not do any follow-up on how the delivery service was which is very surprising to me.So to sum up, I'd give the TV about 3 and a half-starsThe price 4 starsand Amazon delivery service 0 stars.","Date":"February 19, 2006"}

The colors are spectacular in HDTV especially sports and movies with progressive scan DVD. The reception you get really depends on the channel, some analog channel reception is better than others. I have digital cable from Comcast. The HDTV channels are awesome, I just wish there were more of them but I know in time there will be. I don't know why some of the other reviewers were knocking this TV, they must have bought a defective set.  My previous Toshiba 30\" lasted 17 years and I did a ton of research on this TV. I compared it to Sony, Phillips, Panasonic, Magnavox, Samsung and the picture on this TV was among the best out of all of them.

When I first received the TV the picture was warped.  I called Toshiba to have it looked at (Toshiba support was freindly and helpful).  The local repair guy said it was a bad picture tube and that he needed to take it back with him to the shop for repairs.  6 weeks later I finally got the TV back and it still wasn't quite right, so I called the repair folks to come back out to my house.  Apparently they needed to recalibrate the TV 'for my environment.'That was the bad part of the story.  The good part of the story is that I am now happy with the TV and have been enjoying it for several weeks.  I am using component video for all input signals.  The picture looks fantastic when playing DVD's.  I wish I could say that the picture also looks fantastic for HD TV (coming from Comcast) but it doesn't.  It does look really, really good - but not fantastic.  Non-HD TV is acceptible.  For a comparison, I looked at a Sharp Aquos belonging to a friend of mine.  The Aquos has a much nicer picture quality than my TV.  However, my friend paid twice as much as I did and only has a 32\" screen.All in all, I have to say that I am happy with my purchase.  It was my first foray into HD and price was a major consideration.  I would consider this TV to be a very good TV 'for the money'.  Anyone who is limited to a sub-$1000 budget should definitely consider it.  However, if you aren't bound by a small budget or don't mind a smaller screen size I would look into something else.","Date":"November 28, 2005"}

I have my dvd player and Dish 921 HD receiver set at 480p with the TV upconverting to 1080i. This seems to be the best picture I can get and it looks fantastic, especially on HD channels.

{"Title":"Excellent widescreen HDTV at a terrific price.","Author":"D. R. Schryer","ReviewID":"R3UND9Q260FRP","Overall":"good","Content":"If you currently have a conventional TV set with the traditional 4:3 aspect ratio but watch a lot of DVDs, you're probably tired of black spaces above and below the picture wasting much of your TV's screen size whenever you watch the widescreen movies which have become the norm on DVD. The cure for this problem is to get a widescreen TV with a 16:9 aspect ratio. This Toshiba is an excellent 16:9 TV with a very sharp picture. Also important, this is an HDTV set which is ready to display the dramatically improved picture quality characteristic of the new High Definition Television broadcasts to which all networks are rapidly converting and which are now available from most cable and satellite providers. Although this Toshiba's 34\" screen may not be as huge as projection TVs and some of the new thinscreen plasma TVs, it is still quite large. Furthermore, it's picture quality is equal to plasma TVs and better than projection TVs -- and its price is much lower. All things considered if you want a widescreen TV that's ready for HDTV and you don't want to break your budget to get one, this excellent Toshiba set may well be the answer.I note that several reviewers have advised against buying this TV, asserting that it is made by Orion for Toshiba, rather than by Toshiba itself. This is important because of the excellent reputaion of TVs built by Toshiba.

{"Title":"Good all-around","Author":"Andrew Pleasants","ReviewID":"RDVRDOIZ24KIQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV as a do-it-all device. I wanted to get a FP LCD monitor for my computer, and I was looking into panels that had multiple inputs. I wanted to be able to use it to play games and watch DVDs as well be able to use it for my computer. I figured while I was at it I might as well equip myself with something that can handle HD signals and I can watch tv on as well. The following is my take on its performance in said areas:PC:As a computer monitor it works very well. I am EXTREMELY picky about this type of thing and I wouldn't say it was good if it wasn't. I use it primarily as a PC monitor and I would rate it's pc performance a 4 out of 5. To get the best picture you need a decent video card and a decent VGA  cable(read: WUXGA or UXGA and some cases SXGA because of the high resolution of the panel). DVI->HDMI does not display well, you can use it in a pinch, but it will not look right, the tv was not designed to use this as a pc input. VGA works just fine, but you have to be sure you enable your resolution to match the native resolution of the monitor (the same is true with ANY LCD FP if you want the best picture quality). The native resolution of the panel is 1366x768... you can enable 1360x768 and it will chop 3 pixels (you dont lose any visual data, it just doesn't use these pixels) off of each side. Look for a program called \"powerstrip\" if you can't get your desktop to accept that resolution by default. If you choose not to use a widescreen desktop, then set the monitor picture size to 4:3 instead of Wide and use a desktop resolution of 1024x768 (the height of 768 ensures that you are still using native pixels). If you have trouble getting games to run at 1360x768 this is also a good option (set the game res to 1024x768 and change the picture size on the monitor).The picture quality is crisp and clear. There can be some very minor \"ghosting\" effects around certain colors/texts which can be aggrevated by a poor quality VGA cable. For the most part you will not notice this unless you sit extremely close to the panel or you display odd color combinations (i.e. fine bright blue text on a black background blurrs a little bit). As I said, I am extremely picky about this type of thing and if it was bothersome enough to return the monitor, I would. As with most LCDs it favors red a little bit and sometimes there can be a bit of boldness/bleeding on strong red in tight spaces (like a bright red bolded font).As far as pc games go it performs beautifully. Games are crisp, vibrant and clear. Best of all there is no response time \"ghosting\". This is something I was very concerned about because I play a lot of CS, BF2, etc. This monitor responds just as quickly as my CRT. I noticed absolutely no ghosting.Note: Most games today have command line options to set their resolution to special/custom sizes. The widescreen res you are looking for is 1360x768. Some games (like CS1.6) do not specifically support 1360x768 but do have wide aspect resolutions that still work well, but there is slight interpolation using non-native resolutions that will cause things to look a little different (still very very playable). And if all else fails you can always use 1024x768 and set the monitor to 4:3.Games:When not using it as a pc monitor I use it mostly to play PS2 and Xbox. I purchased component cables for both (which I would highly recommend) so I will comment on that.Both systems are very crisp and very clear. There is NO ghosting whatsoever and I read that others had problems with delay in response and lag between input and action on-screen. I have noticed no such thing. Again, I am extremely discerning about this type of thing and if that were the case, I would have returned it. Perhaps they had faulty panels or were using odd input sources. As far as component goes, they play VERY well. Again I would rate this 4 out of 5 because I have noticed a strange problem with PS2 displays. In certain PS2 games when there is very fine detail or there is some type of filter/mask/blur effect in the game, the panel seems to display it incorrectly. Its really hard to give an example, but its like if there is a blur effect on a shiny object, instead of the blur being uniform and fading, it has something of a checkerboard pattern. It is akin to trying to reproduce 32-bit color in 24 or 16-bit mode on a computer... it takes the two closest colors and checkerboards them together so that it seems like its one solid color. I have only noticed this in a handful of games, and even in those games it is usually restricted to whatever the softening/blurring effect is on. If you want a good example, pop in Final Fantasy Tactics for PS1. The game seems to have a full screen blur on it, I suppose to soften the sprites and make it more fluid. However, when using component cables (I have tried 2 different cables) the screen just seems to have a checkerboarded pattern instead of a fluid/smooth fading/softening to it. A minor gripe (except for in FFT since it takes up the whole screen) but a gripe none the less. I dont know if its the panel itself, the way the PS2 outputs to component, or perhaps just my panel. But I can say that I dont notice it on Xbox or on the pc. The only other game on my desk that I can think of that displays the problem is Mega Man X8 (which looks sweet in progressive mode, just hold down X and triangle as the game boots). Around some parts of the characters (easily seen on Zero's sigma blade) there is a shine/blur effect and it does the same thing.TV:I dont have HDTV or digital cable for that matter, so the standard signal is decent at best. Very watchable, but it performs like all LCDs do when using a non-digital/HD signal. No gripes.DVD:Crisp, clear and vibrant. I don't have component cables for my dvd player so I havent watched any in progressive scan yet, but via PC and PS2 (SCPH30001, no progressive) it looks fantastic (I think I actually prefer the PS2). I can only imagine it with a pro-scan set top.Bottom line:As long as your panel is in working condition and you have the right equipment for it, it makes a dynamite PC and videogame monitor. Thats the whole reason I bought it so I can assure you that I am very critical about those features. I don't know why other reviews are stating it doesn't perform in those areas when it does. Don't be shy of this model if you want to use it for a PC, games, dvd or a TV. It shines in all categories, its not extremely expensive and its about the perfect size as an all-in one without being too big a monitor or too small a TV. I recommend it.","Date":"October 10, 2005"}

The \"W\" model is a bit older, and I'm not certain of its current manufacturing status, but there is an enormous difference between the two when using them with a PC.If you intend to use the monitor for a PC, be sure to only get the \"W\" model, not the \"WA\".  Pay attention to the labeling from the manufacturer on the box (and not the retailer's labels).  The \"WA\" and \"W\" clearly have different labels and they are indicated as such on the boxes.  Don't take the retailer's word for what they are selling either, because most sales people at the stores have no idea there is a difference.I first bought what I thought was a an LN-R238W (which turned out really to be the \"WA\" model instead) from a local Best Buy.Upon unpacking it and setting it up, I was very pleased with picture quality with both my HDTV set top box (Adelphia Los Angeles with a Moxie DVR).  The quality using the component inputs was outstanding for all the HDTV channels, and the quality was also excellent using a Samsung DVD player with the HDMI input (both the DVD player and the LN-R238W and WA have HDMI input).I encountered a problem however, when trying to use the VGA input from my computer. The native resolution for PC on the WA is 1280 x 728, which produced barely passable results with blurring of text and color pushing and bleeding around the edges.  Also the gamma and brightness were unacceptable as well.I was curious about why the PC monitor wasn't working as I had anticipated, but then I noticed that manual indicated there were two versions of the 23\" Samsung, i.e., the \"W\" and the \"WA\".  I had always assumed that there was only one model, and that I had purchased the \"W\" because that's how Best Buy was advertising it.The manual indicated that the resolution for the PC monitor with the \"W\" was 1360 x 768, which obviously is a slightly bigger bit of screen real estate than the resolution for the WA.  Not a lot, but different.  In fact, upon reading the manual a bit more carefully, it appeared that the only real true PC resolution for the WA model was 1024 x 768, which was way smaller than the \"W\" model's resolution.I tried the 1024 x 768 on the WA, and it was passable, but just barely and didn't display enough of the screen to be truly useful for me. Also, the text was still too blurry to be satisfying, and I was unable to correct the blurring and bleeding enough to satisfy me.  I also tried various other resolutions with the WA set, and could actually get it to go to 1360 x 768 using the NVIDIA drivers, but I just couldn't get the text to display acceptably without blurring and color bleeding.I then started to read the reviews here, at CNet, at Circuit City's site, at AVSForums.com, and anywhere else I could find reviews, and discovered that others had the same problem, and that there was really a difference between the \"W\" model (which I didn't have but wanted) and the WA model which I had been supplied with by Best Buy (even though they were passing it off as the \"W\").So, I decided I wanted to see if there really was a difference between the WA and the W models in real life.  I knew that Best Buy wasn't to be trusted, so I thought of other stores I could check to see if they had a true \"W\" model I could buy.  I figured if the W was really better, I'd keep it and return the WA to Best Buy (which has a 30-day return policy for TV's with no restocking charge).  So, I called a local Circuit City and verified they had a true \"W\" in stock (not \"WA\") and bought it, hooked it up and immediately noticed a stunning difference.Don't let anyone tell you that there is no difference between the W and the WA when it comes to using the set as a PC Monitor, because there is, and it's huge.The W is simply stunning, with bright, clear text, correct color and gamma, and that was without doing any calibration or adjustment, right out of the box.It is likely the case that there is no difference for use with broadcast HDTV signals or with DVD playback.  But if you plan to use the set with a PC, be absolutely sure you get the \"W\" and not the \"WA\" set.Now that I've got the correct model, I have to say I'd recommend it (the true \"W\" model) to anyone who wants to get a larger monitor to use with their PC as well as a solid LCD HD display for HDTV, DVD's and even SDTV.Of course, if you're not interested in the PC monitor function, then you can settle for the WA model and you won't be any worse for wear.A couple of other notes:  Don't even think of using the HDMI input for your PC display.  The VGA input uses true 1x1 pixel mapping (which is why the display on the W is so good at 1360 x 768), but like all LCD HDTV's the set employs a good deal of overscan with the HDMI (as well as component) inputs used to display HDTV.  This is acceptable for watching broadcast TV and DVD playback, but it doesn't work with PC displays.  Various people have tried to get it to work using Powerstrip (a very useful utility which allows one to design their own custom monitor timings for their PC to be able to use various HDTV's with either DVI inputs or HDMI) or the NVIDIA drivers.  It really doesn't work well, so unless you've got a lot of time and patience, don't even think about it.  You've got to use the VGA input which works very well.In my case, I have a dual display NVIDIA card and I use the Samsung as a 2nd monitor, to extend my desktop...But it's so cool to see the desktop really large, that I sometimes find myself using it as my primary monitor...Anyway, just be careful which model number you get if you decide to buy the 23\" Samsung LCD HDTV.","Date":"February 11, 2006"}

Perhaps this is due to a large size of the monitor versus the number of pixels, so one has to view it from a good distance.

I purchased a Samsung LN R238W, HDTV Ready, 23 inch Widescreen LCD ten days ago. This Samsung LCD has the best picture quality of any TV ever made. I have never seen whites so white and blacks so black, and all the colors are so vivid and sharp. This TV is eyeball popping even for regular broadcards and it is amazing for HDTV and XBox Games. This new technology TV takes the advantages of Plasma , the advantages of LCD, the best features of CRT TVs, mixes them all together, adds a long list of new technology features. Auto Sharpness, Brightness, Contrast, Color Processing, etc and gives you something better. The picture is so outstanding the LCD TV looks bigger than it is in any size room. 32 Billion Colors. The sound is excellent for the built in speakers also. Extended Frequency Surround Sound, with fully adjustable 5 band EQ. You can customize both picture and audio all you want and save your setups.

{"Title":"Awesome display, Great buy","Author":"T. Phadhana-Anake","ReviewID":"R2SFOJFNUP6GQH","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this Samsung few weeks ago because of its extremely nice picture and functionalities. I use it for my bedroom as a primary PC monitor as well as cable and DVD.PC wise, although it doesn't have DVI input, its VGA input is already very good at 1360 x 768 resolution. It is comparable to my old Sony Trinitron monitor running at 1280 x 1024. It is also excellent for gaming (WoW). Btw, if you do plan to use it as a PC monitor, do spend the money on quality VGA cables. In the beginning I used a VGA cable bought from Bestbuy. For few hours there I thought LCD TV wasn't going to deliver the quality of pc monitor afterall. There was ghosting effect all over. I went online, ordered new cable UXGA ~$25. Problem fixed. The picture looks crisp, clear from then.For DVD playback, this Samsung is hooked up through monster component cables with Sony progressive scan. I wished I 'd bought a player with HDMI output, but it was before I have this Samsung. Overall the picture's clear and the color contrast is really good.I'm planning to get a HDTV box from my service provider soon. Regular digital cable TV looks okay, better than my sony wega though. I'm glad I bought it. And of course, its design is distinct from others. Highly recommended!","Date":"July 27, 2005"}

I thought the Samsung had the best picture and was $150-$200 less than comparable brands (Sony).  I looked for the best price on the Web, and found it for just under $850 at some internet sites.  On a whim, I checked Amazon and was blown away.  It was around $850 from a Amazon (a reputable dealer), PLUS I could return it within 30 days if there were any problems.  None of the other Web dealers offered that.  So I ordered it, paid a paltry $16 for shipping and it arrived 4 days later in perfect condition.I set it up, hooked it into my HD cable box (ComCast) with component cables (I still need to get the HDMI cable) and tuned in a HD channel.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  It was far better than I imagined.  I tuned in Pulp Fiction on HD-HBO and could actually see the individual hairs on Samuel L Jackson's fro!  The color contrast was brilliant.Now, like most LCD TVs the picture quality is just OK on the non-HD broadcasts, but I'm willing to live with this for now b/c most channels are moving to HD.You can't go wrong with this TV or the price/experience with Amazon.","Date":"May 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"Best Bang for your Buck","Author":"Scott Lean \"strctskllz\"","ReviewID":"RZ7HNCFP12JM7","Overall":"good","Content":"First and foremost, this is the best TV you can get for the price.  After doing a lot of research on HDTV's I chose this one for my bedrooom.  23'' inches is perfect considering I live in a one bedroom apartment.  People I worn you to play close attention to the HD inputs TV's have.  With technology rapidly changing and retailers trying to sell older goods, make sure you purchase a TV with and HDMI input.  Don't settle for a DVI input because it's a must that the audio be wired seperately.  This may cause your video and audio to be slightly out of sync, especially when watching live events.  Though HDMI cables can be costly they carry both audio and video signals.  And, if you lucky like me, your cable provider allows HD cable service at an extra minimal cost.  This experience was truely plug and play, except for the mounting time, and hiding the wires in the wall.  I've never spent so much damn time watching the discovery channel.  The sports look amazing and even the non-HD channels look more crisp.  Its even more of a plus if you have TIVO or DVR, you can watch the same jaw dropping segments over and over again.One downfall this television does have is that many other manufacturers harness their HDMI ports to the motherboard with one or two screws.  Samsung doesn't.  The first TV I bought worked great, then the HDMI port loosened from the motherboard, and wasn't functional.  The TV simply wouldn't recognize I had my HD cable plugged in.  I suggest buying an extended service plan with any piece of electronics over $250, yes this also applies to IPODS.  We all know it breaks down to be about a dollar a day for the next three years, but it's well worth it.  I took my TV back to Circuit City, they exchanged it with no problem.  Unfortunately, when I returned it my brother bought a 42'' HDTV LCD and made me feel like a broke joke, but that's another story.All in all its worth every penny!!

I recently moved to Tokyo Japan, and given the small apt space that is the norm here, I settled on the 23inch version.What originally enticed me about this LCD was its exceptional picture quality.  This can been seen everywhere on Xbox360 kiosks.  The contrast ratio is great, and the brightness is just right.  Picture very sharp.I then researched for months, with regards to the usablity of this LCD HD TV as a viable PC Monitor.  I found the information on the Amazon reviews lacking on this topic, so I will address it here.I bought a new, high end SVGA cable to go with my purchase.  I wasn't sure if my old video cable was fine or not, but at <$10, I ordered it together with this LCD TV.  I would urge you to do the same.  Setup was a snap, I plugged in my PC to the LCD, and it just boots up like any other monitor.  The LCD displays MANY resolutions, NOT just 1388 by 768.  My video card actually doesn't do that resolution, but I am using 1280 by 768, and I'm very impressed still.  The images are crisp and sharp, unlike your traditional LCD monitors, where if you don't use the native resolution, the picture looks like crap.One more thing, this HD LCD as a PC monitor can also run many low resolution games.  I tried a few emulators, and I was blown away.  Old arcade games were using the entire wide screen even though the resolution was not at 1388 x 768 standard.  I was using MAME to test these games.  Final Fight, Street Fighter, it was like a theather experience to the blasts from the past!I love this TV.  Go for it.  $600-$700 bucks is soooooo worth it.I didn't really cover the Non-PC usage here, but the other reviews should cover that topic.  I'm using Component Video to my Progressive scan DVD player, and using Panoramic/16:9 wide screen mode for the movie.  Looks terrific.  No ghosting at all.Did I mention I love this ?

{"Title":"Stop whining already","Author":"M. Harms","ReviewID":"RN9H50GMVUQOC","Overall":"good","Content":"For all of you whining about the R238W vs. R238WA, stop already.  Yes, the resolutions are different, but that really has zero impact on the ability to reproduce hi-def images.  All you need for 720P hi-def is, you guessed it, 1280x720 resolution, which is what the R238WA delivers.  And would you really be able to see the difference in resolution between the 2 sets anway?  Doubtful since the R238W is not true 1080i so it would display at 720P as well.  You may have a legitimate gripe if you use this as a PC monitor, but if you use it just for TV, then it is a wash.  Plus, when I ordered mine for $750, the next closest price at a reputable location was about $200 to $250 more.  Is the extra resolution really worth an extra $200 if you won't notice it anyway.

Noooooooo!  You have got to be kidding me! Arghhh! I had heard the rumors, but unfortunately I am now a statistic.  I have the Samsung LNR238W, so I pulled up the Samsung website and searched for their policy on dead pixels and this is what I found...One or two dead pixels out of the approximately 300,000 to 1.3 million pixels on a typical LCD television is normal. Generally, then, if you have only a few dead pixels, service is not an option.With that said, what we do about an LCD TV with dead pixels depends on:The number of dead pixelsThe location of the dead pixelsThe color of the dead pixelsThe size of the LCD TV screenI then called Samsung and I was told that the tolerance for my 23\" size LCD was 17+ pixels.  Needless to say, I am not very happy about this.  The single \"dead\" pixel is actually white in color and does not affect my gaming.  But I do see it when I am at the COD2 menu screen.  It's not that big of a deal, but the fact that this is not even covered under warranty is a little irritating.  Right now I am not sure whether I should hope that I don't get any more or that I get at least another 16 within the next 11 months.  Words to the wise for all of you LCD shoppers... check the manufacturer warranty on defective pixels!MY ORIGINAL POST:I did not want to take a chance with getting the \"A\" model, so I picked up this set from my local brick and mortar store. I did send an email to customer service and they said that they have resolved this issue; however I still did not want to take the chance.I specifically got this set for my XBOX 360 setup that I have in my computer room. In the end, I picked this tv because it had the following specs:1) Quick 12 ms response time2) Outstanding picture and Samsung quality3) 23\" because this is big enough for sitting up close to (3-4 ft)4) Speakers are under the screen which allows me to put my surround sound front speakers on the sides of the tv.5) The unit is tall enough that my center surround speaker can be placed in front of the tv and it does not block the viewThis tv passed all of these criteria with flying colors. I would also say that the built in speakers sound pretty good to me and if you are not in need of surround sound these should work just fine for most folk. The picture produced by my XBOX is outstanding: nice and crisp, great vivid color, a real joy to play COD2 on! This tv also looks wonderful just sitting on my desk. When my mother in-law saw it the other night the first word out of her mouth was \"BlinG!\" She just loved the way the tv looked just sitting there in the \"off\" position. And then when I fired up the XBOX and she got a look at those lovely menu screens I think that sold her on this set.As for watching tv, I can say that this is the best LCD out there. It does a great job with regular broadcast signals in both clarity and stretching a normal 4:3 picture. The Samsung stretches in a way that does not noticeable distort the image like most of the other brands do, including the more expensive Sony Bravia line. In regards to the size, this is perfect for me since I am sitting fairly close and playing games. However, if you are planning on sitting on a couch and watching from a distance you will probably want to go for the 26\". I would recommend that you measure the distance that you will be sitting from your tv at home and then go into your local store and watch the different screen sizes from that same distance (it doesn't matter what brand, just find out what size you will need before shopping brands). You may find that you need to get a larger screen, like a 32\". This process can be long and painful as it took me months (literally) to decide on a size and brand.As for my little 23\" Sammy, I could not be happier. If you need a 23\" LCD HDTV you will not be disappointed with this little gem! I highly recommend one especially if you are gaming with a 360.","Date":"January 17, 2006"}
{"Title":"Beware!","Author":"C. Han \"hch\"","ReviewID":"R7E991R0I84JV","Overall":"good","Content":"I was ordered this TV from Amazon(Jan/6/06)($749). And I received it three days later. I really disappointed after read manual. Samsung 23\" LCD TV has two different models. I think most people don't know about that. There is R238W(Resolution 1366x768) and R238WA(1280x720).Amazon selling R238WA, but they listing model is R238W. I think they ordered cheaper model from manufacturer and selling with higher resolution model name on it. (They changed later)Next day I called Amazon and asked to replace it, but she didn't recognized R238WA, anyway she offered $100 discount when I keep this TV.(not bad)But I was denied because my feel is not as good. After two hours later from end of call I got email from Amazon, about my new TV has already shipped out by second day air. WOW! very impressed. Even first TV is still in my living room. I was called Wednesday and Friday morning received replacement.Excellent customer service! Anyway disappointed again they sent same model again. I called and asked refund, I already printed postage-paid return shipping label from Amazon(I didn't open the box) and I return it tomorrow. I think they don't have #R238W model.Please anyone purchased this model #R238W from online store, please let me know which store has this TV. I think most online store selling #238WA(cheaper and low resolution) instead of #238W. I know that 1366x768 VS. 1280x720 video quality is not much different.(Just diff numbers)You can't find out this 238WA model from online search even Samsung home page.(very funny)Only find out from manual front cover and page 81.Sorry for the other story.Anyway I watched this TV two nights, and my experience of this TV is excellent quality and beautiful design.Picture is sharp and clear and nice touch from edge to edge and nice side buttons. On & off switch with melody option is good.This 23\"TV is large enough for 2-3 bedroom apt living room.When I installed this TV in my living room(2 bedroom). WOW!Feel is much larger than I thought.Remote control is simple and easy to use.But, one minus is (Anynet) function, (Anynet) means you can control your VCR and DVD player with your TV remote. But only available with Samsung brand. This is not big issue.I recommend this TV.This time I try to shop at local retail store.Sorry for bad English.Addition,Jan/24/06today I purchased this TV from Circuit city.Only paid $728. This week(Jan/22-Jan/28) Circuit city has big sale. This TV retail price is$999 but $100 price break and additionally 10% off on this TV, price tag is $809,I had 10% off coupon, I paid $728 plus tax total paid $765(best price ever at retail store}. Go hurry sale end this Saturday.But be carefull they have #238WA too!First time Circuit city staff brought #238WA, what a disappointed and I went to salesman and explained about what is wrong and he check the computer and went to back, few min later he brought #238W. I am lucky.So, you must check the serial number before take it to home.I really satisfied with this TV.Great quality and beautiful design.Highly recommend!Amazon has just model number changed but TV description is not changed.(This TV is diff resolution)","Date":"January 13, 2006"}

{"Title":"An awesome HDTV: perfect for gaming","Author":"Peter","ReviewID":"R14TTBAWFNXDCI","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this Samsung LNR238W to serve all of my gaming needs.  It met my all my expectations and I give it my highest recommendation.  The following are my experiences while testing for problems.Pixel Response Time/Ghosting: Nonexistent.  I tried 480i signals through component, s-video, and composite and this lcd is just as responsive as a crt.Input lag: Nonexistent.  I heard of a problem that some hdtv owners(50\"DLP for example) experienced where there is lag or delay between the time they input a command on a game console and the time action appears on screen, due to video scaling or upconversion.  This problem would also manifest itself as unsynchronized video and audio when watching movies.  I was worried about it, but extensive testing showed that this monitor is free of this problem.  I tried Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for N64 (composite), Wave Race: Blue Storm for Nintendo Gamecube (s-video), Ninja Gaiden for Xbox (480i and 480p through components), Need for Speed Underground for Xbox (480i component), and Tekken 5 for PS2(480i component) and they all were responsive and fine, no problems.  Video was perfectly synchronized with the audio, which I ran through my hometheater system.Dead Pixels: My monitor didn't have any.Uniformity: My monitor didn't have this problem.  Colors appear as they should throughout the whole screen.  That is, there aren't any spots where red things show up green, for example.Quality of scaling: Solid image-wise, and no processing lag.  The video of non-native resolution signals that lcd's display are typically lower in quality than that of scaled signals on a crt.  However, this hdtv scales pretty well compared to other lcds, and I am completely satisfied with the image quality while I watch 480i/p video.  There is some noticeable pixelation and sharp edges sometimes on scaled 480i/p video, but that is to be expected - a crt would smooth those things over.Image geometry: perfect.  No bending, bowing, or other distortion you almost always get with crts nowadays.  Straight lines appear straight.I don't have a spare vga cable or an xbox 360 yet, so I haven't tested native resolution signals, but I'm sure they'll be excellent, I've seen xbox 360 running on this monitor at retail kiosks and the image is great - it's just a matter of whether a particular unit of this model is normal or not.As for the one review that mentioned input lag, maybe he reviewed a different tv by mistake, or had a defective unit, or was running his console through a pc tv tuner card through to the monitor or something unusual like that?  I don't know.This hdtv kicks butt.  By the way, this is the monitor that Microsoft chose to use in all their retail kisoks - so if you go to bestbuy, circuitcity or EB the xbox 360 is using this model.  Microsoft has confidence in this tv.","Date":"November 30, 2005"}

{"Title":"OK for TV, poor for computer.","Author":"briankangaroo","ReviewID":"RLLY8NGX0AZW0","Overall":"good","Content":"I returned this unit. I had purchased it for use as a computer monitor with TV Pip. While it does do this, it's performance as a computer monitor was unacceptable.The entire color range was off with no adjustments available. Red was off the charts and so bright, reading text in that color was actually painful for my eyes.The other problem involved a blurry image. With some CRT's it's possible to align the R, G, and B signals on screen to get a crisp image. It seemed like this monitor needed that sort of tuning ability. There is one slider adjustment that addresses this 'focus' problem, but even at it's optimized tuning, the image had a blur.This monitor worked good as a TV tuner. One problem though. While you have the ability to change between WS and 4:3, the documentation gives you the caveat that using it in any mode that places black bands on the screen runs the risk of causing screen burn in. That must not be an issue related to this product, but something to consider when purchasing a new flatscreen TV.I'd purchase this unit in the future if these bugs were worked out as well as an automatic signal detection mode to eliminate having to manually swich formats for different uses. Until then, I'm in the den with my projector and the office with a regular 21\" monitor.","Date":"March 18, 2006"}

I would not recommend it if you are just planning on watching regular cable and you have no HD box to let it live up to its full potential. The picture quality is better on a regular analog TV if you are hooking up to straight cable. I have had this TV for 2 months now and the only flaw that I can find is that the sound quality is not the best.  I hooked it up to my stereo and unfortunately the power of the TV is so weak that even turning it up all the way I wasn't able to get it to a listening level that was acceptable. That really bummed me out.  It actually sounds better when I just don't plug it into an exteranl source for sound. Other than that it is very light, you can hang it on the wall and its actually a great size for a bedroom tv.  I have it out in my living room now and its too hard to see if you are too far away from it. You are suppose to be able to hook it up to a computer as a monitor but I have not tried it yet.  According to reviews I read before buying, it wasn't a good monitor.  I bought it as a TV and it makes a great TV, its very stylish to boot.

{"Title":"Value Priced But You Get What You Pay For...","Author":"Annonymous \"An Honest Reviewer\"","ReviewID":"R3LBM56YCBIXHJ","Overall":"good","Content":"Cheap and value priced: About $200.00 retail less than comparable LCD TVs but you get what you pay for.Decent picture: However, you MUST use the video or component inputs to get a good picture. The \"ant\" input is horrible and will show every flaw in your cable connection. I did not see anything wrong with my tube TV until I replaced it with this one, then I immediately saw ghosts and noise. I ended up replacing my cable run to the bedroom with quad-shielded cable and upgraded my splitters from standard cable to the digital bandwidth variety which provided the increased bandwith that is necessary to provide the best possible digital cable reception (there's also splitters designed for HD as well). I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that your \"splitter\" matches your type of cable service (e.g., standard, digital or HD) to receive the best possible picture from your new set.  In addition, the viewing angles are extremely limited. You must be \"dead-on-center\" to get a good picture. Even the slightest deviation (from center) will \"wash-out\" the picture. In my case, that's not a problem because my TV is viewed from a fixed location in the bedroom and never have a need to look at it from an angle. And finally, this TV must be viewed from a reasonable distance to get a flaw-free picture (even with a pristine cable connection). From what I've read, LCD TVs are not as good at processing quick scene changes and sometimes the lag is noticable; however, at the proper viewing distance, those lags become tolerable. In my case, I had to push the new LCD TV back an additional 2 feet (from where I had my 19 inch tube set) to get those lags to a tolerable level. This TV has a 12ms response time and the better LCDs have an 8ms response time. I don't know if that makes a difference for TV reception but I do know that it will make a big difference if you attempt to use this as a PC monitor and one of your kids trys to play a top-end game. Also, I have heard that Olevia support is basically non-existant or difficult to reach so consider a supplemental warranty if available for a reasonable price. And finally, one of the most important pieces of information you'll need. To turn the TV \"on or off\" from your universal cable remote control, you can use the code for an LG brand TV which is \"0056.\"In summary, I can't make any final recommendations because I have no basis for comparison as this is my first-ever LCD TV. However, I can tell you that my wife \"loves it\" so I guess all the extra work \"paid-off\" in the end.","Date":"September 15, 2006"}

But overall for a 61in TV very nice, The TV Guide function is cool now if Time warner would just give me a cable card I'd be setJust found out about a minor glitch, this TV is not quite ready for primetime HDMI, the HDMI input does NOT support pure digital audio (only PCM) the end result if you have a new dvd player that has HDMI out going into TV then out to AV receiver via optical out, only PCM (standard Dolby) will be output not Digital Dolby.  Now I know lots of people just run the audio direct from the dvd to AV Reciever anyway but this defeats my purpose of trying out the Samsung DVD950 so I can simplify life and use the Anynet function to switch to a DVD.  Bottom line the ANynet function leaves much to be desired and they probably should of just given you a programable remote with macros instead.

Previous raters have said its \"not as bright\" as others in the same category; on the contrary, I find the picture quite bright. Also, I don't know what the one guy meant with the warranty not being good when purchased from Amazon. I registered my TV with Samsung and there was no trouble.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars has to do with Amazon's \"white glove\" delivery, rather than the TV itself. For $199, you're supposed to get \"knowledgeable\" delivery professionals to unpack it, hook it up, and set it up. Amazon tells you that you have to \"sign off\" on the delivery saying it is in perfect condition and then you cannot return it. The guys knew *nothing* about how to set it up (other than the electrical plug), so you pretty much have to decide whether or not it's perfect without seeing the picture. This is a pretty involved hook-up when you're connecting an HD cable box (with the three video cables) and the directions do not have examples of all scenarios. The delivery men were rather rude about my wanting to see the picture before signing off on the product.In short, the time for delivery was great, it appears to have arrived in great condition, but for $199, I expected to have delivery men who knew how to hook it up. Since then, I noticed that the link for more information on the delivery service is no longer working. You might want to download the manual and get an idea for the set-up before it is delivered, because you won't get help with the \"white glove\" service.","Date":"February 6, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good tv, works well, minor engineering flaws.","Author":"Randretti","ReviewID":"R2WWTOLYB0T3R2","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: Large, clear picture. Watching the tv show \"Lost\", the picture is absolutely stellar. Vivid, crisp images. There have been other HD programs that are not as impressive. I'm assuming they were in 480p vs 720p, but that's an assumption for the difference in picture clarity in HD programming. Xbox gaming has worked flawlessly, with no lag. There have been no problems with color wheel buzzing (as was reported on the hlp series), and I'm not a person who sees rainbows, thus, I haven't seen them on this tv either. The tv guide onscreen has been incredibly easy to use. It was functioning correctly the 2nd day.CONS: The engineering for particular screens is awkward. To use the PIP, you can hit 1 button on the remote to bring up a pre-programmed channel, but all you can do is turn it on or off. To surf, or change the pip channel, you must go through the menu and go through several screens, and then you can only select an analog channel. Also, the remote that comes with the tv does not allow you to surf a day at a time on the tv guide onscreen. I can only go hour by hour. You can use the search feature which works well, but I feel I should be able to hit a button or select a time to search for programming and I need another remote to do it. (The remote that would include cd/dvd controls for fast forward).SUMMARY: Those are my only 2 complaints and since they are engineering issues I have to recommend the tv. I'm happy with it and will keep it for years if it keeps working as well as it is. I've had the tv for about 2 weeks.","Date":"August 14, 2005"}

The picture is bright, sharp, and clear but of course is still subject to diminished quality when it is in direct sunlight or in a very bright room. I just close my blinds about halfway in the day time and it looks great. I can't help but attribute this to the fact that Samsung pioneered the DLP technology and they have had the longest amount of time to perfect it.I mainly decided on DLP as I am an avid gamer and DLP is a great choice for games as it has no possible \"burn-in\" at all (something both LCD and Plasma can suffer from). DLP is also an amazing value if you want a very large size screen.I've had this TV for the last 3 months now and am extremely pleased with it's performance. DVDs are a joy and appear extremely film-like and clean. Video games look fantastic with the 720p display bringing out all of the detail you would expect.The UI and remote are good and offer quick access to the features that you need with one press (like ratio switching).The TV has a very thin profile and looks great when sitting on the stand that is designed for it. The stand easily holds about 4 full sized components like a TiVo or Cable Box.The whole tv only weighs in at 120 or so lbs. I was easily able to lift this onto the stand with one person helping on the other side. It is extremely light for it's size.The Bad:If you are a big picture in picture fan you might want to look elsewhere, as the PIP option is locked to a second source, so you can forget browsing other channels with it. About all it is good for is keeping an eye on another source like your xbox or dvd.Summary:If you want a large DLP today you'll be hard pressed to find a better DLP picture on the market. If this review is a bit old however do look around and see what is out there. This technology is developing rapidly and advancements are being made by other companies all the time. If you have your eye on this set already, buy with confidence and know you're getting a quality and great looking product.","Date":"November 21, 2005"}
{"Title":"I could not be happier with this TV","Author":"Brandon","ReviewID":"RYAAFLMZJMJMJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I spent about 4 months reading reviews, checking prices, and comparing pictures before selecting the Samsung Hlr5667w.Unfortunately by the time I finally went to get the dang thing, the TV proved hard to find. Imagine my surprise when a I found the 61\" model (hlr6167w) had been knocked down to the price I was prepared to pay for the 56\".The main reason I am writing this is to let everyone know now is the time to buy, these models are being discountined and will soon be replaced. I was able to get this TV for 1999.99, the new models will almost assuredly be close as twice as much.As far as the TV itself goes, it is amazing. HD on it is unbelievable, if you have seen it on display at a Best Buy or some such store that doesn't offer a true HD signal, you haven't seen anything.The Screen is vivid and crystal clear in a room full of light, there is practically no glare on the screen. Of course, it looks great in the darkness as well.I was a little worried about how regular \"low-def\" TV would look, but even that looks good.Most who pay this much for a TV will probably use surround sound but it is worth noting that, The sound is well above what I expected, as well.It's like having a movie screen in your home, and I could not be happier.I also, would like to thank everyone who takes time to review products both here and elsewhere. I read literally hundreds of reviews on these TV's before buying.","Date":"March 27, 2006"}

{"Title":"Pretty.. Huge","Author":"Jonathan Kim","ReviewID":"R1K2LZ98AEE2ED","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is huge.  I was originally planning on purchasing a 50-55 inch TV at the $2K price range.  There is a lot of value in this TV.HDTV looks awesome.  It even looks better than DVDs playing through over the component cables.  This TV doesn't have 1080p support (it has 1080i though), but you're not really missing anything because most HDTV programs aren't transmitted higher than 720p (which this TV fully supports).  This TV also supports Cablecards if your cable provider has them available.The other semi-problem mentioned earlier was that there wasn't enough high end inputs (hdmi, DVI), and it's true though there are enough component inputs if you prefer that.  The Anynet function and TV Guide feature was useless for me, but it's always nice to have extra features.One of the neatest features is plugging my computer into the TV through the D-Sub (15 pin monitor) input.  Though some care has to be made so you don't accidentally set the resolution to something that can't be displayed properly on the TV.  It is pretty finicky when it comes to what resolutions can be displayed unlike a regular monitor.One other minor issue I had was the viewing angle.  The TV doesn't come with a stand, so some thought has to be put into the placement of this TV.  For optimal viewing, you want to be able to be eye level with the center of the TV.Overall, I am very satisfied with this TV purchase and recommend it as a very good DLP solution for those that don't need the 1080p or a lot of the higher end digital inputs.edit - The newer 61\" 1080p model (HL-R6168W) from Samsung might be more value for only a few hundred dollars more as of the prices posted on Amazon today (4.3.06).","Date":"March 30, 2006"}

We had it delivered via the amazon delivery option.  The delivery guys unboxed it outside the house and placed it on the floor because we hadn't yet found an appropriate tv stand.  My father in law and husband then spent the day getting everything programmed.  The picture quality is clear and I've grown dependent on the tv guide which comes with the tv. We've had no problems with the tv.  We definitely liked the ease and competitive pricing amazon offered. I know some people have had difficulty with the shipping.  We've found that the delivery people will give you a call if you request it, so you don't need to wait around all day.  As for another person having a problem with the delivery people not hooking the tv up for him, I've never encountered delivery people who would do that.

Its a great unit but it may be a good time to go 1080P and consider flat panel. One MAJOR CAVEAT that I am learning is that the lamp will last about 2000 - 2500 hours and cost $200-400 and its seems to vary by models. I was told it has 7k life by Samsung but my particular lamp has started to fade after 2000-2200 hrs. The cost of 9 to 10 lamps over 10 years even at do it yourself route at $200 a pop makes Plasma and flat panel LCD a better choice. Plasma has 40,000 hours life and no maintenance and it may pay over time. In 2005, 60\" plasma was 7k vs. 3 k for 720p DLP, but now the price differential is not that great, and picture quality is awesome for Panasonic, Samsung, Sony and LG.","Date":"December 11, 2006"}

I am very impressed with it's features and the quality of the HD picture, it's just an overall fine product for the money.

What I am getting at here is DO NOT BUY a big screen HDTV without purchasing the extended warrenty no matter what brand of TV.

{"Title":"Top of the line circa 2005","Author":"D. C. Gartner","ReviewID":"R2IJOXTIBX1OZM","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this television for about two years now. When I purchased it they were around five thousand dollars. I've seen them for sale now for about three thousand recently. I think this is owing to the television being only 780p, versus 1080i or 1080p. Unless you are planning on viewing a lot of blu-ray or hd dvd's, be aware that even the best signal from a dvd or satelitte, won't get you to 1080i. This being said the television is terrific in bright light, which is why I purchased it in the first place. The combination of an extremely bright picture and an anti-reflective coating on the screen means you can watch the screen even with direct sunlight on the screen. The one issue I had with the JVC, is the first bulb burned out at six months. I had purchased an extended warranty, so I was covered. The tech came out and changed it in about five minutes. Since then the second bulb has been going  for about a year and a half. At two hundred a pop, I would seriously recommend getting the warranty. Other than that, awesome TV, your visitors will be shocked at the sheer enormity of the screen. 4 times the screen size of a 42\" plasma, think about it...","Date":"August 27, 2007"}
{"Title":"Excellent value for the money!","Author":"R. Ocampo \"Artisan\"","ReviewID":"R3HQXN1EQO4Z7V","Overall":"good","Content":"Plasma technology is still the best in terms of brightness, contrast and physical dimensions. You can hang it on a wall and cramp it in tighter spaces.The other option would be an LCD screen, but the picture quality (artifacts) and price factor would make it an odd decision to go for when you could shell out a little more for a Plasma display. Also beware there are two types of LCD screens - LCD and LCD projection. LCD is the same as the computer monitors. Although it has greatly improved since it's introduction, it's still slow and expensive. LCD projection I would shy away from at the moment because it doesn't compare to DLP. Although Sony came out with a so-called \"3LCD\" technology to rival the high-end DLP 3-chip systems. Know that DLP was first for the 3-chip technology (for their high-end applications like major movie houses), it's not who's first as time will tell how each fare.Yet a good rival that has been hitting the market is LCoS (Liquid Crystal on Silicon). JVC has renamed this HD-ILA and Sony came out with their own name branding - but they are all LCoS technology. Prices have yet to come down and is said to have none of the \"cons\" of LCD and DLP projection TV by exhibiting good blacks, great speed in drawing the picture and no rainbow effect. Until prices drop to competitive levels with the rest of the other products, this won't be on my list until next year.The next best option behind Plasma, IMO, is DLP by Texas Instruments. It gives the  best blacks and color rendition among it's class of projection televisions.How good is DLP? It was the first and no-brainer choice for commercial theaters that project digital movies (i.e. the first digital screening of Star Wars prequels). These are front-projection units that need a reasonably dark room to refrain from washing out the colors it projects to the screen. For personal viewing in bedrooms and living rooms, you need a rear-projection DLP. This encases the whole unit like a regular projection television, and is more kind to ambient light.A. The downside to DLP rear-projection monitors is:The amount of moving parts it entails to create the picture -1. A digital micromirror device (DMD) to reflect light in 1,024 different shades of gray. Because these tiny mirrors each move independently, there is a risk of failure.2. A color wheel that spins in thousands of revolutions per minute to help create the  color. The wheel bearing will eventually wear out and will need to be replaced by a technician over time. Furthermore, the noise created as it spins to speed is evident when you power up the monitor. Although any minimal audio volume will drown this sound out.3. The lamp (light bulb) that projects the image onto the screen, just like any other light bulb, has a usable life. Each manufacturer states how long their bulbs will last before it needs to be replaced. A typical life span for 4 hours of viewing each day will last around 4 years. The good news: it only takes to replace the bulb in order to bring the picture quality back to like new just as when you bought the TV. This is versus Plasma and LCD which lose their brightness over time (LCD rear projection also takes replacing the bulb).4. The amount of heat created by the lamp is enormous that you can't box the unit in a cabinet nor stick it's back side too near to the wall unless you want to increase wear on the monitor or create a melt-down.B. The upside is the picture quality you get. In fact the price you would have paid to get this kind of quality and usability over time is unfathomable you would be glad you didn't have to pay for Plasma (of course if you can afford a Plasma or need to hang it on a wall, then this is your only option). Just replace the bulb and you're good to go for another 4 years or so. You can't do that with a Plasma and re-charge the gasses. Unlike Plasma, it's brightness virtually stays constant throughout the usable life of the lamp. Samsung will warn the user when it is nearing the end.C. Physical dimensions enable you to lift the monitor alone. Try doing that to a CRT. Samsung's \"floating screen\" design enables the picture to give a good impression that the picture is on it's own space. However, the silver accent below the screen (although very elegant) does not fully take the effect into what they are marketing it to be as any light falling on the silver accent reveals the screen is not floating.With all being said, four stars for this monitor because Samsung gives us a lame manual that leaves the technical savvy people out of the loop and questioning for more information - despite the TV having one of the best picture quality and Samsung technology loaded into the monitor (enhanced picture processing and the abillity to fine tune the colors based on ambient light surrounding).Four stars because despite all the technology loaded, they give us one HDMI in socket that doubles as the old DVI socket care of your own ability to buy an HDMI to DVI cable. No FireWire audio input/output unlike other manufacturers. And only one digital audio output courtesty of an optical Toslink connection.The good part is Samsung's strict policy for defective mirror devices, strict manufacturing tolerance and elegant design which helps you trust buying their products more than other manufacturers.A word of caution to shoppers and owners of DLP and other technology that enable true high definition output: the reason for most bad reviews is their disappointment when watching with various low quality sources. They are mislead into thinking their picture quality will improve with these kinds of monitors. On the contrary a monitor of this caliber will show even more imperfections and reveal the low quality output that is being fed into it - garbage in, garbage out. Subscribing to digital cable/satellite isn't enough. You have to subscribe to HDTV and be viewing HDTV sources in order to see it's full potential. MTV isn't HDTV. Know which channels air in high definition. Discovery Channel HD (not simply Discovery Channel) is the perfect viewing sample.You want to maximize the input of sources by using HDMI/DVI cables. Don't use RCA or S-video jacks for this monitor. The least video cable you should use is component cable. Even that I wouldn't recommend because that would mean transmitting analog video signal from source (cable box, DVD player) to TV. Keep the signal pure and clean as possible by keeping it digital until the last minute.Lastly, this monitor's standard output is 720p (progressive) output. Other lower or higher sources fed into the unit will make it convert to 720p. This is helpful info into putting less strain or digital conversion and artifacting to the monitor - feed it 720p signal already so all the monitor has to do is output directly rather than do further processing.If you want the latest technology, this \"old\" technology isn't for you as there are already a handful of 1080p monitors in the market including monitors made by Samsung. If you're on a budget and want a bang for your buck, you won't make a mistake with this purchase and handing it down the line when  you're ready to make a step up into the future (for the same price you purchased this unit).","Date":"November 22, 2005"}

The picture quality is exceptional for HD channels and DVDs in the 480p mode(as good as any of the LCD TVs).  Performance on normal analog channels is fair to good compared to direct view TV performance on the same channels (both HD and analog are off cable).  Digital audio sound is excellent.  The setup and custom adjustment menus are easy to use but sometimes annoying as the menus have 4 to 5 layers.  The TV fits in a very small space for its screen size (width and depth are the smallest available for this size).  The manual is good but assumes you understand HD terminology and doesn't explain the difference in performance when choosing many of the settings.

It's very light (about 50 pounds), not very deep (maybe 14 inches) and the picture quality is outstanding.  Try watching one of the Pixar movies on it, you will be astounded and Discovery on HD is almost better than going on vacation. It's a table top DLP projection TV, so there are no pixels to burn out like LCD or Plasma, it fits on most TV carts, and the price was awesome.  Including shipping to Texas, I paid $400 less than what I would have paid in store because the retail price was lower, and I didn't have to pay sales tax.  It's simple to use, and only requires a bulb replacement every few years, much like a computer projector would.  There is one warning I can bestow, and that is despite showing HDTV content gorgeously, the quality on regular stations may \"appear\" to dip.  You get used to this, though and Samsung recommends hooking your cable/satellite receiver up to the TV using 2 connections (one component or HDMI, and one S-video, the latter helping with the picture quality of the non HD channels).  All in all, I am VERY happy with this TV.

(Sat. nite live will never be the same again!)Overall, a GREAT value for the price! anything close to 40\" in LCD (which don't make 42'-that big) or a plasma will cost you much more....do your own homework!","Date":"January 8, 2006"}
{"Title":"Samsung HL-R4266W","Author":"Jim \"Jim\"","ReviewID":"R21230V00UQT6M","Overall":"good","Content":"I Looked at more HDTV's than I would like to remember......for two years. I researched Plasma, LCD, LCD projection, good old CRT and DLP.  Although I still think Plasma has a slightly better picture when viewing standard TV, it's a dead heat while viweing HDTV or high quality DVD. Givin the value of the Samsung 42\" DLP, unless you want to hang one on the wall this is a great choice!  This TV has some great features to customize the picture and it is easy to set up. It has great sound when you are not playing it through your home cinema system as well.OK, here is my 15-month update:  WOW!  This unit continues to impress me.  I am picking up free HDTV with a TURK antenna on my dish.  Sporting events on FOX are like they are in your room.  DVD's look great with progressive scan.  My TV is on 14 hours a day and no problems to date.  On top of it all for the money it's a no brainier. Buy it!","Date":"October 31, 2005"}

Ventimiglio \"GamerGuy\"","ReviewID":"RBCS4P4996ZBB","Overall":"good","Content":"I just got this system over the weekend and its great so far.  HDTV channels are a must.  Regular feed is ok but I dont watch many TV shows anyways.  Movies and gaming is incredible on this TV.  My XBOX 360 looks amazing on it.  Its very light and easy to set up.  The menus are pretty user friendly.  I had heard complaints about the fan on the bulb but I cant really notice the sound at all.  The TV does look best if at least 5-7 feet away.  I chose this model because I do alot of gaming and DLP technology I heard was best for gaming because it never will burn an image in the screen.  Shipping also was rather quick.  I ordered it on a Saturday and recieved a call by Thursday to set up a delivery time. Not as fast as I would have liked but worth the wait.","Date":"January 24, 2006"}
{"Title":"Content is king","Author":"R. Lesieur","ReviewID":"RFD40NXCB7LKO","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: Three customizable video profiles (movies, broadcast TV...); Excellent brightness and contrast; good viewing angles L & R of center; Generous input options;Cons: Big, centered on/off button cries out for my toddler to turn it on/off/on/off. Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it.The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player (<$150); the visual results were simply outstanding.Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables.So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite). This is not a cheap endeavor.","Date":"July 17, 2006"}

When you are in the market for a 42 inch tv, you won't be dissapointed. This tv has vivid colors, great screen quality and excellent dimensions for a cozy space.

Based on a small handful of reviews scattered over the net and the liking of my current 61\", I decided to purchase another Samsung.  I've had my 61\" for a couple of years and truly enjoy the picture quality.After unboxing the 42\", my expectations were high.  I connected the unit to my existing cable and hit the power button.  The user menu has come a long way since my 61\" and again, the picture quality was great!Remember, garbage in garbage out:)  The true test for image quality for any TV is DVD.

{"Title":"Good buy, quality product.","Author":"Gift Card Recipient","ReviewID":"R2WEBZXUM5HU6R","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this TV shortly before Christmas at the sale price (which was amazing) and at first I was extremely uncertain about it.  A 42\" TV with new technology for such a low price seemed a bit strange, and I had somewhat of a hunch that maybe they were dumping them off at a low price because of poor quality.  That has all since subsided.However, when I first received the television the FIRST DAY of usage I had a big problem with it.  After a few hours of usage the TV shut off by itself.  I had originally thought that I may have laid on the remote control, so I turned the TV back on to only have it shutoff again about 30 seconds later.  I noticed the lights in front of the television flashing, and having remembered seeing something about that in the manual, I looked to find out the bulb is defective.  This seemed to confirm my aforementioned fears, and so I immediately called Samsung to have a repairman come fix the thing.  A defective bulb is no big deal, but annoying nonetheless.  Well needless to say, I don't like their method of appointments, they put in a \"ticket\" and then have someone call YOU back to make the arrangement.  It took them almost 5 days (including saturday and sunday) to call back, and the appointment was 10 days from the day I arranged it.It was a definite inconvenience to have a large television sitting in the middle of a room completely unable to function, but taking into consideration that it was the holiday season, I suppose it can be excused.  The repairman came mid-morning, took his shoes off at the door, was quiet and polite and immediately went to work on the television.  He left no doubt in my mind that he was an expert at what he does, and after replacing the bulb realized there was a problem with some internal component so he replaced that as well.Although it was an inconvenience to have to go through that process for the television, I couldn't be happier with what I paid for it and the resulting picture.  I have the TV connected through a Monster Cable HDMI (if you want top of the line, go with Monster even though its extremely pricey) with a Comcast DVR-HD box.  Sports are clearly the superior quality, but the overall quality of the HD channels is amazing.  I also have a Playstation 2 connected through the component cables and it looks  just as good considering its not an HD output.  But if you are going to connect a non-hd system (xbox, ps2) I suggest getting the component cables because using the RCA plugs was horrid, blurry, and not even worth playing.Beyond all of that this television was a great buy, and even though the price has since gone up its still not THAT bad.  I'd have given it 5 stars, but to me 5 stars would be a 1080p output.  If you're looking for a good TV for a decent price, I'd say this is definitely it.","Date":"January 10, 2007"}

Stone","ReviewID":"R23QK399SI0V60","Overall":"good","Content":"Well ill have to keep this review short as its getting late.This is actually the first TV that i have taken to write a review for (Its Currently 12:19AM so my spelling might be a bit off)Alright enough of the pointless talk, here is my review.Oh by the way the S4 of this TV is out. (New Color Wheel) its called the HL-S4266W which has a new Color wheel.Upon first reading about this TV i was a bit skeptical. The whole \"The Shell on the bottom of the screen when your seeing black on the scrren.\" First of all you do see a little what looks like a white shell on the bottom of ths screen. However is is barely noticable unless your trying to pick it out (Had my friend try to find something wrong with the screen when it was all black and he had problems finding the \"Shell\")When i was buying a TV i needed one that was less the 40\" in width because my wall unit is only 40\" wide. So i was looking at a lot of Plasma's and LCD's but all of them were around 41-45\" because of the side mounted speakers. This TV however was 39.3\" wide which fit perfecly in the space. At first i hooked up my Xbox360 to the system with my friend and booted it up. The TV makes a chime sound which is a little catchy but not positive nor negitive in my opinion. I get to the Xbox screen, set it for 720P/Widescreen. So i start playing a game and my first reaction was it looked like crap compared to my Sony 60\" WEGA Tv. After my friend left I was looking over at the Xbox and figured out that the video cable was switched to EDTV instead of HDTV. When i switched it to HDTV i saw a HUGE differnce. The picture was really really sharp and the TV is VERY bright which is good for movies and games. I am really happy with the purchase of this TV and i would reccomend it to anyone that is looking for a good cheap Hi-Def TV.Pros: - Looks amazing if you feed it a High-Def source. - Very nice and bright if you want to play games or watch movies. - The interface is very clean and neat. (Not importaint but i like it) - It is a very nice looking TV compared to some others i saw at Bestbuy. - I like the speakers at the bottom of the TV. It gives the screen a very clean and nice cut.Cons: - This TV brings out details from bad sources such as a standard DVD Player (I would just purchase a Upconvert DVD Player which outputs to 720P and you will have a amazing picture) - The Bulb will burn out in about 2-4 years (Depending on use)","Date":"November 23, 2006"}

My first bad decision was to purchase any HDTV before I had a digital signal. What stores or manufacturers won't tell you is that the analog picture is surprisingly poor; not as good as your old tv picture. Consumer Reports will back this up with the black circle ratings (poorest quality) for the best of plasma, LCD, and DLP hdtvs, but I received that info a day later. I owned the Samsung 42\" hdtv for just one day and returned it to BestBuy ( they were running a special with a price very close to Amazon's) and may buy later this year after  I get digital service (and a probable Samsung hdtv price drop). So I am collecting digital service prices (cable and satellite), including Verizon's Fios cable that is just being built in my area. I currently have Comcast cable analog, and appreciate the new competition from other digital providers.","Date":"February 18, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great picture, buy the extended warranty","Author":"Manuel G. Zamora \"manzam\"","ReviewID":"R1PH4QYUT9ADRP","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture quality is really what I wanted in a HDTV. I bought it for \"no screen burn\" when viewing 4:3, for the fact that the picture looks better then most other DLPs, connections and of course price when compared to LCD and Plasma.  Overall, great piece of equipment, speakers are truly exceptional. We have had it for about 2 years and the brightness seems to be fading, quick adjustment and it looks like when new. Though, be sure to buy the extended warranty-the mirror device that spins to produce the picture shattered right after warranty expired, but we bought an extended warranty (for the bulb replacement option, priced at $400 per bulb when we purchased) and I am so happy we did.  After the replacement, there are artifacts as I am sure due to the glass shattering into a million pieces inside the box. The tech vacuumed the box, but it looks like he missed a few pieces of glass because we can see white spots when a black picture shows. I will have to call them to fix the picture problem. Overall, very satisfied with picture quality.","Date":"November 10, 2007"}

Don't forget that you'll have to replace the $250 bulb in this set every couple of years and that it is about a foot thick.I'm personally very happy with the picture and it made more sense from a price standpoint when I purchased it. However, if you look here, you'll see bigger 46-inch Samsung DLPs for the same price (if your room will support that) and even the 50-inchers are only about $150 more; that is 150 well-spent dollars.","Date":"January 5, 2007"}

We were pleased with the look and feel of this TV, but the picture did not live up to expectations.We are on satellite but do not have an HDTV tuner yet. The channels looked grainy and had weird pixel movement in the dark areas. We were able to get the color and contrast just about perfect with some minor adjustments, and the sound was great. We realize that DVDs probably look much better, but on a day to day basis we don't watch DVDs, we watch regular TV.The picture looked awesome from across the room, but when sitting on the couch about 6-7 feet from the screen, it really didn't look that great. We explored a few more options in the stores and finally opted to return this TV for a slightly better price on a plasma.Bottom line is, the TV is probably fine if you have the right setup, but for us it just wasn't the best choice.","Date":"October 19, 2005"}

The picture on this TV is clear, bright and lifelike, and the images are eye-popping. DVD's are amazing, even in 480P. I'm using the DirecTV HD TiVo as my satellite source, and an over-the-air antenna for local HD channels. DirecTV's HD choices are limited, but the picture on those (compressed) channels is beautiful. But the piece-de-resistance is the non-compressed local HDTV broadcasts. Just amazing. Our local CBS affiliate does their news in HD, and it makes the boring local news riveting just for the picture. Getting strong signals from an antenna can be challenging, but it's worth it if you can do it.The set has more options than you'll ever need, but I particularly like the surround-sound simulation mode that plays a simulated 5.1 image over the set's 2 speakers. It actually creates sounds that seems to come from behind you. Of course, you can hook it up to your home theater for the real thing (over an optical connection).I have noticed no rainbow effects that some say appear on DLP's, and the picture is plenty bright, even in my room that has a wall of windows behind me and skylights above me.In short, if you can afford this TV, you shouldn't hestitate to buy it. Amazon has a great sale on it now (July 2005), so it's even less painful. Besides, amortize it over the 10-15 years you'll enjoy this TV, and it's a bargain.","Date":"July 2, 2005"}

{"Title":"GREAT T.V.","Author":"Robert Soltz","ReviewID":"R4889X5E0Q3ZG","Overall":"good","Content":"I probably spent 60 hours researching this TV.  During my research I learned about a few possible downsides; the DLP chip is not the newest, greatest version. Picture quality when going through a digital cable box, in the lower 100 channels is not as good as higher numbered channels or when the cable is connected directly. The PIP controls are awkward. But the pros far outweighed the cons. I ordered the set.The picture, especially in HIDEF is unbelievable. If you like PIP you can actually watch the equivalent of two 32\" simultaneously.One thing I really like about DLP is that there is no worry about picture degradation or burn in.  I also own a LCD TV.  That sets owners manual states not to watch shows that don't fill the whole screen more then 10% of the time.  I don't like having to \"zoom\" pictures to fill the screen.  With the HLR56687W, it is a non-issue.  Those shows that don't fill the entire screen are still plenty big, and because of the design of the TV I usually don't even notice that they are not wide format.Amazon.com was $500 less then Circuit City on this set. Also  Amazon.com only charged $149 for delivery and setup.  Almost all the other internet sites selling this set wanted between $215 and $300 for delivery \"to the door only\".If you are looking for a large screen TV, BUY THIS SET, you will not be sorry!","Date":"August 25, 2005"}

I purchased this tv last weekend (03-31-06) from a local Circuit City store.  They had it delivered the very next day, unboxed it, conntected it, and made sure it worked.  The picture quality is incredible.  I also purchased a Samsung progressive scan HD-convert DVD player with this TV.  I don't think I will ever go to the movie theater again.  The sound quality from the built in speakers is decent.  I have the TV hooked up to my HTS so I only use the TV's speakers when I watch regular tv.I hooked up my Xbox to this TV using the component cables and the graphics are incredible.  Be sure to go into your Xbox settings (from the dashboard) and enable 480p, 720p, 1080i, and widescreen.  I didn't do that at first and was very disappointed with the graphics and got nausea from the stretched and blocky image.  Once I enabled those settings it made a HUGE difference.  Also, the menu and setup for the tv is extremely user-friendly.  It is very straight forward and self explanatory.My complaints about this tv are the TV Guide feature, the included (universal) tv remote included, and the \"rainbow effect\".  As far as the TV Guide, it does not work for me at all.  I've keyed in all our local settings and it is not providing us with any listings.  Everything is showing \"not available\".  As far as the tv remote, it's a universal remote which allows you to program and control a DVD player, VCR, and Cable box.  Like I said, I purchased a Samsung DVD player along with this tv and am only able to control \"play\" and \"stop\" from the tv remote.  I am unable to scroll through the DVD menu, needless to say make any selections.  Good thing I purchased a separate universal remote from CC at the time of this purchase.  The \"rainbow effect\" was only something I had read about in regards to DLP's but never actually seen it.  Yesterday, however,  I started noticing it while watching a DVD (24 season 3).  It only occurs in certain scenes, and like I said, I only noticed it for the first time yesterday, so it's only on certain DVD's.Someone had mentioned a loud fan.  If you are watching tv on mute you will hear the fan, but I sure don't.  You will only hear the fan after you turn off your TV.  The fan will stay on for about a minute to cool down the bulb.  Not a problem for me.Overall, the picture quality is incredible.  Watching anything in HD makes up for the negative.  If you plan on using HDMI I'd recommend buying the HDMI cable from Walmart for about $25.  The least expensive HDMI cable Circuit City had was selling for an outrageous $100.  I did purchase a Monster Surge Protector (stage 1) for a little over $100.  I would highly recommend it.  If I could do it again I probably would have invested in a stage 2 or 3 surge protector and paid the extra $200-$300.  I did not opt for their extended warranty.PS.  Our living room looks so much nicer with this TV, it's not only a great piece of electronic, but also a great piece of furniture.","Date":"April 8, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV","Author":"Lincoln R. Ward","ReviewID":"R3MK3I9GTJLHP6","Overall":"good","Content":"Right out of the box this TV has been awesome.  I was unsure about purchasing such a big ticket item online, but after shopping around and reading all of the other reviews on this site about delivery and no hassles I am glad I didn't settle for what I could gt at a Best Buy or Circut City.  The only place I saw that had a slightly lower price for this model was on Ebay, but that was without shipping.  Did I mention shipping from Amazon was FREE.  I was really happy and surprised about that.So far after watching a DVD (Star Wars III) and flipping through the channels I have to say that this TV is great.  I have it hooked up to a Bose 3.2.1 system and they really go well together.  All I could ever ask for in a home entertainment system....now all I have to do is upgrade my cable to the HD package.Hope my rambling review was of some help...","Date":"March 16, 2006"}

I am very glad I did. This TV is great and just like everyone says, 15 minutes after opening it you're watching great TV. It takes some tweaking to get it looking better but even out of the box, it's cool. I used the Star Wars Episode III disc to optimize the DVD settings with the THX optimizer and now DVDs look even better. I still have to get the HDMI cable to make the digital cable look better. Great TV, great price. Downsides are just like everyone else said - the TV guide feature is highly annoying. Samsung would do well to get rid of them. I actually can't figure out how to disable it completely yet but I reduced it somewhat. The PIP might not be the best but my digital cable has PIP so I'll use that one. These are SMALL gripes. This TV is amazing and all my pals with high end TVs were really impressed. The family is happy and so am I. Just be careful with it on the stand as it's not that heavy and one good push can knock it off. I'm going to get some rubber feet for it or something...DO NOT Hesitate to buy this television. Of course there are better and there always will be but this one is fantastic. Good job Samsung.","Date":"April 23, 2006"}

First of all, the price is excellent. Best Buy sells this for $2699.00. Plus, you'll pay tax and probably pay for delivery too. Amazons listed price is ALL you'll pay. As for shipping,it took about 10 days and was delivered by a moving company who brought it in the house, set it up and even took the box and packing materials with them. Fifteen minutes after the truck pulled in my driveway I was watching TV, no exaggeration. Did I mention that the picture is incredible?

{"Title":"Simply AMAZING!","Author":"Mr. President","ReviewID":"R1KPJP1OJ4D9EQ","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this 2 months ago and every time I turn it on I'm still muttering to myself AMAZING. The picture is bright with great color rendition. With HD (we have DISH satellite service) it is simply unbelievable the degree of clarity and detail. Using the latest Star Wars DVD as another example you'll see detail you never saw at the theater. We use an older progressive scan and I can't imagine it being any better!On the initial selection process we chose this over Sony based on side by side comparisons. We had a hard time deciding between this model and the 50\" Samsung. We sit 15' away and we were afraid this TV would overwhelm the room. Bottomline, if you're facing the same situation, get the 56\". Also I designed/built a new stand to accommodate the TV.. it's worked out great. The dimensions of that are 24\"deep x 5' long x 26\" high. It works and views great at that level.For those with shipping concers the delivery was great. They had a high end trucking service that brought the TV in , took it out the box and plugged it in to make sure it was OK.This is a great TV!  The fit and finish are excellant, instructions clear cut and the item well packaged. Samsung is the new leader in my estimation!","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

Dube \"Lucy\"","ReviewID":"R2VO304M0AGY9","Overall":"good","Content":"Our son just bought us a Samsung HLR5667W DLP television which was ordered from Amazon.com in January.  I have to admit we were a little nervous about purchasing such a major item from an internet based company but we worried in vain. Beginning with the fact that the TV arrived 4 days before we expected it, the whole delivery process was phenomenal.  Two gentlemen removed the set from the box, brought it in the house and set the whole thing up cables and all.  They also gave us plenty of time to look everything over and be sure there were no problems. The picture is so clear and bright and of course there are no words to describe the HD. The price was incredible as even with the shipping charges it was over $800 less than in any local store such as CC, BB or Sears. We decided not to purchase the Extended Warranty but we did register the TV on our Visa and they will give us a second year of warranty at no charge. Visa even offered us a five year from date of purchase plan for $189.00. I guess you can tell we are very pleased with our TV and with the excellent service received from Amazon.com.","Date":"January 26, 2006"}
{"Title":"Bright, Clear, and sharp picture worth every cent it cost.","Author":"D. Milburn \"davart1\"","ReviewID":"R3PM8CN6YYDJFZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV about 6 months and I'm running this with regular ol Direct TV, not the HD and I'm getting a great picture. Setup and controls are easy with tons of hookups and inputs on the back and side. Plenty of screen setting and did I mention the BRIGHT pricture. I'd say you really need to be at the very least 10' away to see the best picture as any closer you will see some pixelling with regular SAT input without the upgrade to HDMI receiver and HD service.I do recommend that you upgrade all of your cables to the best you can afford it goes a long way to improve the picture. I can use the PIP and run my PC screen on one side and watch TV on the other. Which is handy if you are a ADHD multi-tasker like myself. But admittedly running the PC on a S-Video cable doesn't give you the same quality screen you'll get on the PC. I'm using a laptop so I have no other outputs on it. Might try the PC-IN the TV has to offer on a desktop system and see if it's any better one day but right now it's not an issue. However it is nice to play a game in 56\" and game from regular gaming stations like PS2 or Gamecube look GREAT. Some have noted problems with gaming but most of game we use a slower games and I have not noticed a problem or I'm sure I would have heard about it from the short people. As I noted componant and optical cables do a lot and really do there most with DVD's. I can't say much about the sound I don't use it as I use a surround sound system as I think most people would. It a great TV have a great picture that you can see from the sides as well as the front with no loose of picture like you get on some projection TV. Get it watch it, enjoy it, I don't think you'll go wrong. I'm very pleased with the proformance of this set and would buy another in a minute if I had to do it over.","Date":"June 13, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV, HDMI and PC Inputs","Author":"N Little \"N Little\"","ReviewID":"R20WQIRETX4K1M","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this TV about a month ago.  I have owned many TVs in the past, sticking mostly to the Hitachi brand name because of the success I have had with it over the years.  This was the first time I had purchased a TV over the Internet.  Prior to purchasing, I went to a local store and previewed the TV.  I then purchased the TV on Amazon for $1,999, which was significantly less than anywhere else.  This is a TV that is feature-rich, well built, with good sound and a great picture.  The TV's PC input is exceptional, blowing up the computer screen to 56 inches and making the online experience almost presentation like.My only frustration is that 95% of cable channels are either standard definition or digital, neither of which support the TV's 16:9 viewing angle.  The TV (or some cable boxes) will stretch the picture to fit the \"wide screen\" format, but it clearly disorts the picture and stretches everything.  Hopefully, a great deal more HD channels will be added in the near future.  As far as the TV goes, I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a superb TV at a wonderful price.","Date":"December 27, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great Picture, but audio issues hooking up with amplifier","Author":"Kevin M. Hubbard","ReviewID":"R1K010ADUPDJT9","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my 56\" DLP Samsung for a week now. Yes its annoying that it takes 30 seconds for the bulb to warm up, but once its on, the  DLP 720p looks great. My one and only complaint is trying to use the Samsung built in speakers for my center channel ( TV Voice ). Hooking the TV in with my AC3 5.1 surround sound amplifier was a complete bust.  The Samsung does a lot of video processing ( de-interlacing interlaced video, etc ) which takes time. Samsung apparently delays the audio feed to match  the video latency. If I use the Samsung for my center audio channel, the delay between the TV speakers and my L+R surround speakers is terrible ( think echo-echo-echo ). Wish Samsung had provided the means of disabling this audio delay, apparently - they don't. I've disconnected the Samsung's audio entirely and am back using my PolkAudio center channel speaker stacked on top of my VCR. Bummer.","Date":"December 23, 2005"}

The deciding factor was PIP and cost.  Couple of key notes that I learned:A) Both pictures are comparable - it's personal preferenceB) TV is larger then you think (50 or 56 is plenty) - 10 to 12 feet is needed for viewingC) Amazon has a better price then the others (BB, CC, etc)Ok, here are my toughts on the Samsung 56\" HDTV after two weeks:A) Awesome picture (through Directv) using HDVI and DVD player using ComponentB) Wow factor is there for HD broadcasts! Regular broadcast is limited to reception but mine is great so the picture is great.C) Average - Remote control is ok, I don't like the tv guide option as I have satelite and they don't work together.D) PIP - Does not support PIP for Digital broadcast.E) Slight lag in timing for certain Video games but nothing major (The kicking meter in Madden is slightly off).F) No problems with the DNieG) Amazone was the best price and delivery was quick - No problems - Give them your cell so they can call you otherwise they leave a message on one number.H) Delivery guys moved my existing 36 Sony to another room and placed the TV on stand.

{"Title":"Great TV.  Wonderful for video games!!!","Author":"R. Melcher","ReviewID":"R28SVL46WEHO96","Overall":"good","Content":"I am flabbergasted at the reviews describing \"lag-time\" on video game play for this set.  It is totally incorrect.  If you are playing legacy consoles such as PS2, Cube or first gen X-box some of the games cannot be played in 16:9 ratio because the stretching to fit this view distorts certain aspects of the game making it seem to lag.  For instance if you are familiar with Mario Golf on the Cube, there is a power bar at the bottom of the screen that determines the strength of the swing.  As the meter crosses the screen you have to push the 'A' button at the yard mark for your shot.  If you are playing in 16:9 mode it looks like there is lag from the time that you hit the 'A' button and where the meter shows that you hit it, it is just due to the stretching from 16:9 mode.  Just change the view to 4:3 and the \"problem\" is solved.  DLP sets are perfect for gaming because of the no 'burn in' design.This is really a great set that looks good and has A+ picture quality.  If you are in the market for this type of set I would definitely recommend it.","Date":"January 15, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great TV!","Author":"B. Smith","ReviewID":"RB6N7ULLHTWN4","Overall":"good","Content":"After watching a few football games on my buddies 50\" Samsung DLP. I knew it was time for me to get mine! After a couple of months of researching the pro's and con's of DLP vs. LCD vs. Plasma I finally went with the 56\" Samsung just for the fact that my friend had his for 6 months at that point and had no problem. Now where to order it from? It made no sense to pay the extra cash that the big box stores were advertising the same TV from anywhere from $500 to $2500 more then some on line stores. Now the question became who to choose as my on line store. So once again the research began, pro's and con's to alot of stores, even some bad reviews of Amazon.Com. I decided to go with Amazon, because I had used them in the past for some smaller item purchases and never had any issues. I am glad I went with Amazon.Com as I believe I got the best price at the time for the same TV then several other on line store. Ended up paying right at 1999.99 for this TV. Actually only $200 more then my friends 50\"! The only issue that I had with Amazon.Com was when I initially ordered the TV on a Thurs. the web site said it shipped in 24 hrs and was in stock. Well it was in stock but what happened was that as a security measure from my credit card company, they put a hold on the purchase until verification was given that I was ordering the TV. The problem was that Amazon sent me the confirmation that the order had been received but had not been processed yet and that they would send me another email when the transaction processed. Now it's Friday and I still never receive another email stating the transaction went through. So I call Amazon's customer service, which by the way, was very good! Despite reading some negative reviews. I had no problem contacting them. As a matter of fact they have a cool on line contacting system where you tell them to call you either immediately or in increments of 5 or 10 min. You give them a number to call and BAM your phone rings!  I suppose you just need to know how to navigate their site. I had no problem with it. Anyway, when I did talk to them they said they werent sure why it hadnt processed but was sure it would be ok by 5pm. Sat morning, still no confirmation! So I decided to call the credit card company on my own just to verify that the transaction had even hit their system. It did, but were waiting on verification from me the the order was valid. So I clear that up and they process the order right then. That was the only real heart burn that I had with Amazon, they should have been able to tell me that the CC company needed to be contacted vs. me doing it myself. So now it's Sun, 3 days after my initial order. Get the confirmation email from Amazon saying it will ship on Mon as they don't ship on Sun. Mon morning rolled around and I get the email stating it was shipped out with at tracking number. Well the tracking # didn't work when I went to check it and again I called Amazon customer service and again very good service from the people I talked to. They gave me the name of the shipping company and number and said if I had any additional issue to call them back. I didn't, with the exception of getting the first available date of delivery to my house, which wasn't amazon's fault. So in total it ended up being 10 days before I got my TV. Once it was finally delivered to the house the guys came in unpacked it and set it up. Right out of the box the picture was great! I had read many reviews that a lot of work had to be done to get the pic right. Not in my case. I was waiting on my DirecTV HD box so I just had standard cable but even that looked great running it through my S-Video cable. DVD's spectacular! Once I got the HD TV up and running a few days later and surround sound going it has been the best investment that I have made in awhile. The picture is stellar, no pixallization (sp?) and a lot of local channels are broadcasting in HD now. I acuatlly have had more problems with the satellite feed then the TV itself.  If you looking at this TV it is worth the money. Just don't have that new TV fever thinking you will have it in a few days. The anticipation will drive you nuts!","Date":"March 22, 2006"}

The performance of the TV all depends on your source signal.  Given a good HD signal the picture on this TV is just awesome, but analog signal looks bad due to the large size of the screen.  SD signal produces ok pictures.  Moving pictures in all 3 signal modes are clear with no blurring or streaking.There is plenty of inputs for all the accessory one would need.  I recommend using the component video inputs whenever possible for best picture quality.  My playstation 2 works great on this TV with no delay of any sort.  My buddy says the picture quality will be better if I use the component video inputs, but I haven't got around to buying the cable yet.Most TV of this class have more than 30watts for sound, but this hasn't been an issue at all.  For normal viewing I'm only using about 1/5 of max.  I find the sound quality to be excellent on this TV.I really like the antenna/cable button on the remote, since I have analog cable and use a roof top antenna for many over the air broadcast HD channels.  Most of the 80 or so channels on my Comcast analog cable service is SD quality, and there are only a handful of HD channels.The negatives of this TV so far has been the lack of a HD tuner for the PIP feature, and the lack of a PIP/main picture swap button on the remote.  (PIP won't pickup HD channels, and you have to go into several layers in the menu to swap pictures with the PIP.Speaking of menus, the transparent on screen menu on this TV is very cool, as you can see the effect of the changes or adjustment you're making as you make them.Given my experience thusfar I would buy this TV again, and I'm sure most people will be very happy with it as well.","Date":"March 6, 2006"}

Delivery only took six days and the guys who unloaded it were very professional and neat. I had it up and running in about five minutes. I just had the cable card installed yesterday to do away with another box and it works awesome. The HD channels are insane!! I wish there were more but in due time. The regular digital channels come in good not nearly as good as the HD channels but that is nothing against the TV. It is my cable providers siganal (Cox). The only two gripes I have are the TV guide system does not put the channels in the numerical order that I receive them from Cox. They are all over the place so I have to sit down and put them in the order I want one by one unfortunately. And I wish they had a swap button for the picture in picture. You have to go through the whole menu to swap the channels but very minor complaints considering the overall package.

The picture is great, especially wiht HD signals.  I got a CABLE CARD from my cable company so I don't need a box and I can use the TV's TV GUIDE which is less of a hassle.  The only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because of the remote, espeically the PIP function. You have to go to the MENU to change the PIP inputs and you can only use the UP/DOWN buttons to change the channels.  This is a major hassle during football season when I want to watch multiple games to keep track of my fantasy teams (guys, you know what I'm talking about!).  I would recommend getting a univeral remote. I recently bought the Harmony 628 and it works great!  Only paid $48 from Amazon with free shipping.

{"Title":"very good cost/benefit","Author":"NJ Dad \"FS\"","ReviewID":"R2S7V5GUJ8HE82","Overall":"good","Content":"Others have already done, well by the way, the leg work to explain the features of this very good TV set so I'll save you some time by going direct to the point. I bought this TV back in January 2006 when true 1080p sets were too expensive yet. Yes, they are still however prices have dropped and will even more towards the year end. I have had no issues with my TV which is hooked up to my Dishnetwork HD set-top box through component cables. I haven't experienced the so called rainbow effect although I frequently watch low-light movies. The PIP is handy and the number of connections is plenty. Built-in speakers do the job for day in day out news and sitcoms but I recommend to get an external system for the movie entertainment.I've been always puzzled by the difference between what TV's specs says and what I see on the info display in regards of screen resolution. TV specs say that this set goes up to 720p max however when I watch HD channels the info display gives me 1080i. I believe the HD signal is being downscaled from 1080i or maybe I'm just a lucky guy :-)Better than herein mentioned TV's image quality I've only seen on Sony's LCos displays. For the price I've paid versus what I'd have to I stick to my current option.","Date":"September 24, 2006"}

Recently the picture became a bit dim.  The repair people wanted $300 to come out and replace the lamp, instead, I purchased some cotton gloves and a replacement lamp (for a total of about $40) and did it myself with the help of my hubby for the heavy lifting ;).  In a matter of minutes, I had the old lamp out and the new one in.  The picture is WONDERFUL!We have loved this tv for the past 8 years, and hope to get many more great years from the tv.One thing I love is the matte finish for the picture.

Before the delivery guys left, I powered on the TV and made sure that it functioned properly.I also purchased the samsung stand for this TV.  I got one of the updated ones, which seems to have fixed their probelem of not supporing the TV in the center.  I even called the stand manufacturer to confirm that I have the updated stand.

I did the research, arrived at this Samsung and couldn't be happier with the purchase.  The picture is outstanding, and the interface is very intuitive.  I now have a Samsung HTiB connected with HDMI cables and an off-air HD antenna for locals with Dish network for other HD content.  I can not stress how pleased I have been with this purchase.A couple of other thoughts for you:HD content -- Evaluate your options well.  I jumped into the dish programming because I wanted all of the HD I could get my grubby paws on.  Now I am paying 10 bucks a month for channels that I only use to show other people how cool HD is.  The locals are what I watch most often.720 vs 1080 -- Still thinking about upgrading to 1080?  I wouldn't.  You need to evaluate content here as well.  How much of the programming you'll be receiving is really 1080?Bottom line - Get a Samsung, you'll thank yourself.","Date":"February 23, 2006"}

Even my wife who hates 'techy' things likes it.A few things you should be aware of. PIP does not work great. It will not swap the pictures if you are in a digital mode. Very upsetting when you are watching to sports games and you can not get sound from the second game without changing the main channel.The TV Guide is not as good as the one you are use to from your cable provider.A few features have to be accessed from the on screen menu, not the remote. For instance, if you are in digital mode and want to change the channel on the PIP window you need to use a menu. The remote buttons do not work for this in digital mode.All-in-all it is a great TV for the price. Enjoy it.","Date":"January 24, 2006"}

Here comes the fear of most Samsung owners, the lamps in these models. My lamp just went out and is now trying to get a service rep to come out and fix it. I feel that for the money these sets cost the lamps should not go out this fast(about 1 month). I guess better now than after the one year warranty. It's been two days now and still waiting for someone to contact me. Overall, Amazon's customer service has been great and we will wait and see about Samsung's.","Date":"March 13, 2006"}

I was a bit concerned about loss of contrast to ambient light but am pleased to discover almost no change in the way the picture looks day or night. If you buy this set be sure and spend an extra 150-200 bucks on an upconvert DVD player, the difference it will make on your current DVD collection will blow you away!  The set does a nice job with standard definition signals as well, always a concern with so little HD programming currently available.  I work in the home theater department of a major electronics retailer and did my homework before deciding which set I'd spend my money on. This set won hands down over any of the other currently available models. It looked great on the showroom floor but it looks even BETTER in my home.  My neighbor across the  street has a 42 inch plasma and it's nice, but i can't wait to show him this 50 inch beauty! I think he'll be a little jealous,  especially when he hears what I paid compared to what he shelled out for his plasma ;) If you're looking to go HD, this is definitely the way to go, more screen for your buck and a picture that will make even the most uninitiated viewer gasp.","Date":"June 11, 2005"}

The picture is great for DVDs (progressive scan) and for HDTV--we get a number of channels over the air, using a standard antenna, and cannot imagine going back to normal TV. Analog cable is okay, but I wouldn't buy an HD TV if that was the bulk of what I watched.When the TV was shipped, there was a slight blemish on the screen; I'm not sure if that occured during shipping or was a manufacturing defect. In any case, Samsung offers 1 year *in home* service, and they sent a person to look at it, ordered a full replacement screen, and returned to install it in a week. I watched them replace the part, and the TV now looks and works as good as new.","Date":"October 22, 2005"}
{"Title":"BEST HD Technology For The Price -- Get Extended Warranty!","Author":"Twins Daddy \"Dennis\"","ReviewID":"R1Y1Y1H6NTSG7N","Overall":"good","Content":"We've been enjoying our 50\" HLN-5065 Sammy DLP for more than 2 years now, with no regrets!  I got the 4-year on-site Extended Warranty at Best Buy for $300 when we bought it and I'm glad we did.  Since this is a relatively new technology, there are bound to be problems that slowly get worked out with each new series that's released.  Last March (at the start of March Madness no less), our screen started randomly freezing with a black and white image on the screen that looked like a photo negative.One call to Best Buy and within a couple of days, a service guy came out and said he had to replace the digital board...We could still watch TV, but just had to shut it down and boot it back up whenever the screen froze...Sometimes 2-3 times a day, sometimes no times a day.  Once the new board arrived and was installed ($292.95 parts + $150 labor), it worked like new for about another month when it did the SAME thing again!This time a different service guy came out and installed a brand new light engine AND digital board ($1,303.72 parts + $150 labor)...Basically ALL NEW GUTS in the TV!  They're the latest version too because he actually had difficulty getting the ports/jacks to line up properly between the new guts and old back cover.  That's when he said they don't make the older parts anymore, since they've made improvements in the technology and use those when repairs are needed...Sounded good to me, so I bought into it!One thing's for sure...The picture has never been better on this screen with both Std Definition and our DirecTV HD feed and OTA Zenith Silver Sensor HD local channels.  So why would I give a product 5 stars when we experienced such problems with it?It's easy...This set delivers a stunning large picture that never degrades (mechanically) over time, and it was $3,200 new when 42\" plasmas were $7,000 to $8,000.  In another 3-4 years, those plasmas will be worthless and we'll just put a new bulb in our DLP and it'll look good-as-new!  Technical difficulties with new technologies should not be unexpected, but rather anticipated...Thus, the reason for purchasing an extended warranty.After more than 1-1/2 years of viewing enjoyment, our $300 warranty paid for $1,900 of brand new parts, including improved technology!  It's like insurance...You don't want to use it, but if you do NEED it, you don't want to find yourself without it.  Since this 50\" DLP is now only $1,800, you should seriously consider it the front-runner in any large screen HDTV purchase comparison.  Don't just consider what you get in picture quality NOW, but what will you still be enjoying several years from now after your neighbor's plasma with multiple screen burn-ins finally gives up the gas and goes screen up in the landfill!","Date":"December 20, 2005"}
{"Title":"Excellent TV","Author":"C. Nellissen \"No one special\"","ReviewID":"R38MRFB0C6HHL4","Overall":"good","Content":"The HD picture quality is exceptional.  I was able to receive HD over my standard cable tv input.  I then added Digital Cable using the cable card.  Without a set top box my cable bill went down (part of a roadrunner and digital package).  The picture quality on HD broadcasts make you feel like you are in the room with the people on screen.  The standard analog channels look poor.  The large screen only accentuates the poor signal quality provided by the cable company.BTW- Time Warners definition of \"digital cable\" is approximately 30 digital channels and the other 50 (?) are analog.  Hopefully over time this will improve.DVD movies vary in quality from excellent to okay.  Depends on  how old the movie is and if it is formatted for 16:9 viewing.Overall I am very happy with the TV Quality.

{"Title":"Re-written Review - ZERO STARS","Author":"Laura","ReviewID":"R2MV1Q2SJMS2E3","Overall":"good","Content":"Picture is great, colour is bright and although I have a very sunny room, the reflection is not much of a problem.  The cabinet is not distracting from the picture as I find the case with other sets.  Every connection imaginable available and easy to do.  Overall I'm very happy with this set.  Now there is a little story - When the TV arrived the hurried delivery team unpacked the set, put it on the floor and turned it on to prove that it was working.  The set came on and a menu was displayed.  Satisfied that the set was working, the delivery team turned it off, and I accepted the TV.  Little did I know that the unit would not stay on for more than 20 seconds without automatically shutting down.  The troubleshooting guide was not able to help me diagnose the problem so I called Samsung.  The Samsung sets come with a 1-year IN HOME warranty.  The in-home part is uncommon with other manufacturers.  I simply had to schedule 1 hour out of my day (they were able to come the next business day) to meet the Samsung service agent.  They replaced the entire inside of the TV and it now works great.  I'm unsure if the set got damaged during shipping, but the in-home service was a breeze.  I now have essentially a brand-new unit.  Samsung was a good deal.  So the lesson being - keep your unit on for a few minutes when it is delivered, and buy Samsung (or another with similar warranty) and protect yourself.  These are delicate units and even a little jostle can shake things to broke.Originally purchased and reviewed in Aug. 2005Updated Jan 2007 - Still performing great.  Set has never required maintenance or a new bulb.  This was a great purchase, I continue to be impressed with this units picture.BIG UPDATE SEPT 2008 - After a short life, my tv now 3 yrs and 3 months old with very minimal usage (avg. 15 min/day - I'm away a lot)is dead in the water.  Light engine is the suspect.  Minimum $800-$1200 to repair, no service center close to me.  So, same TV new is only $1200.  What choice do I really have.  Essentially, I have to write off the TV.  I'm so utterly disappointed with this product.  No TV should cost you $800/year to own.  Samsung no help - out of warranty of course they feel no accountability to taking my money and giving me 3 years for that kind of money - no value.  This is the 2nd time the TV is broken, and both times the entire inside needed replacing.  Never even go to replace a bulb.  Consider that the least of your worries.","Date":"August 30, 2005"}

Amazon had the best price on this television and I have not been disappointed at all. Very easy transaction, amazon used a moving company to deliver the television; they took it out of the box, and set it up in the family room (set up means plug in and make sure it works. All other cable set up is on you). 5 stars for amazon.Now for the television: Great look, great picture, great sound, easy set-up, Love the thing; however you need at least 8 to 9 feet of viewing room between you and the television otherwise the picture does not look sharp and I found it to hurt my eyes if I viewed it closer than 8 feet away. Also keep in mind the lighting and window placement in the room where the television will be in order to prevent / limit any glare on the picture screen.Bottom line - this television is the best bang for your buck hands down.","Date":"August 31, 2005"}

{"Title":"Decent TV, but has its faults","Author":"bleemus","ReviewID":"R1QCOEH81NQ3D","Overall":"good","Content":"When I bought this TV and brought it home, I immediately noticed a curved border on the 4:3 aspect ratio mode.  Upon exchanging the set for another identical set, the problem still exists on the new one, leading me to believe this is a problem on all of this model.  The Samsung web site says that a 1/2\" deviance is \"acceptable\", so if you have the same problem, don't expect the manufacturers warranty to help.  The pincushion problem is not nearly as noticeable in 16:9 format, but if you can't stand the stretching of a 4:3 signal to 16:9, this will be an issue for you as well.The remote control looks like something out of the '80s.  It is functional, but for a big screen TV, you expect more.  I suggest the Harmony remote control, and just toss the stock remote control in a drawer for emergencies.When I spend over 2000 bucks on something, I expect perfection, but did not get it with this set.The Good:-- crisp, bright widescreen pictureThe Bad:-- archaic remote control-- slightly concave screen causes pincushion deviance of anywhere from 1/8\" to 1/4\", very noticable in 4:3 modeUPDATE 1/27/2006:After a few months of owning this tv, I started noticing smudge marks on the set that were not on the front of the picture; these only occured while the picture was a white or very bright color.  I called Samsung after seeing this was a common problem on their support site.  Within a few minutes of talking ot the operator, I had a number of a local shop that is certified to do Samsung repairs.  They were over at my house after about a week.  The repairman replaced the entire engine and ordered a new screen.  After another few weeks, after a replacement screen was obtained by the repair shop, the screen has been replaced.  All of this was done at no extra cost to me, but did take about 3 weeks total to get fixed (not really Samsungs fault).The concave shape of the screen that I complained about in the review is now gone.  My main complaint is that both of the sets that came out of the factory were faulty in one way or another.  I am put off by the low quality coming out of the factory, but when you have this TV with a flat screen and a new engine, it looks pretty darn good.","Date":"September 13, 2005"}
{"Title":"Spectaculistical Fantabulous","Author":"daveywoods","ReviewID":"RR4PACN5H7X29","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV a couple weeks ago, it is absolutely fantastic. I researched quite a bit before settling on DLP and then on this particular model.One negative, it only has one HDMI input. I can't understand this, obviously I need at least a TV input and a DVD input. Why not two HDMI inputs? There's probably a good reason that I'm not aware of, but it seems odd. I'm not even sure if other TVs have multiple HDMI jacks, I'm purely speculating.But let me comment on HDTV in general:1. Its incredible. The picture is spectacular. I'll watch just about anything that's in HD. I have about 8 HD channels, and I mostly ignore all the other channels. A couple nights ago a buddy and I realized we were watching ice skating. The TV is that good. Football is spectacular. I'm sure the Winter Olympics will be awesome, World Cup Soccer, Stanley Cup, NASCAR, playoff baseball,...2. When you spend the time and cost to get one of these, set it up right -- don't just plug it in. You need to get the right video cable (HDMI, DVI, or component all work fine, this is critical), and you need to page thru simple menus on the TV, cable box, satellite box, DVD player, game console, etc.. Don't spend the money and then set it up wrong. Its not hard at all, but if you skip this, you've wasted your time and money.3. If you watch DVDs, you need a progressive scan DVD player to see the best picture. Don't bother with upconverting.4. If you're ready to buy and are paralyzed by anticipation of the next great model and the next big sale, pull the trigger immediately. I wasted a year before finally making the purchase. The DLPs looked great a year ago and cost about the same. Now they're a little better. A year from now they'll be better still. Stop waiting, just buy it. You'll be so glad you did.5. Before you buy a TV, DVD player, and cables, check for sure that you're doing it right. Draw it out if you have to with connections between devices. Look at the back of your devices until you understand for sure what connections are there.","Date":"January 24, 2006"}
{"Title":"Somewhere over the rainbow-effect","Author":"Steve U","ReviewID":"R2B19IUO9NQ9VC","Overall":"good","Content":"After much research, I bought this TV having read all the previous reviews. Despite it having the latest chip and increasing the color wheel speed from 7000 rpm to 10,000 rpm, the rainbow-effect is still very much there (esp. when watching at night). Dark scenes (Lord of the Rings) seem to amplify it.The best I can explain the rainbow effect is when you move your eye quickly from one point on the screen to another point (natural due to subject matter being watched), there's a quick flash of green,blue,red silhouette of the image you were watching, like a ghost effect.If I strain my eye to keep it from happening, it makes it worse. I found that if I relax and just focus in the center of the screen, it goes away (until you start watching TV like you normally do, which is moving your eye with the subject matter).It's even noticeable from when I'm cooking in the kitchen and my head turns around with the tv in the background. I get flashes of color in my peripheral vision. I guess this is why it makes some people sick to the point of throwing up.I'm really IMPRESSED with the picture quality that the DLP produces, but this flaw is quite hard to ignore. My wife and I are going to give it 30 days to see if we can live with it or not. We really want to keep the TV!!! The TV can be watched in the brightest of environments with natural sunlight. The imgages are still better than plasma or LCD (in my opinion). I only wish they could fix the problem of this annoying flaw.","Date":"December 13, 2005"}
{"Title":"Wife wanted it, I fell in love with it...","Author":"Sean Foushee","ReviewID":"RCCY841CPMGQ7","Overall":"good","Content":"I was mad when my old CRT set blew last week, even more upset when my wife told me she wanted to replace it with a $2000 HDTV and measuring 50\" (requiring an upgrade in our furniture and AV cables), but after buying the 5067W at my local BestBuy and setting it up I couldn't be happier.  But, with every big purchase and life changing event (SD->HDTV) a small amount of advice before taking the plunge would have made things go a lot smoother, so let me tell all of you who are thinking about buying this TV a bit of the details that I had to figure out on my own.First, as an owner of a PS2 I was not very happy about the review here that stated the 5067W had a full second delay when using a console.  After further research I found that most DLP sets suffer from this as a result of the time it takes to upconvert the analog signal, but one small bit of information I found made all the difference in the world.  The Samsung set has a GAME mode you can select for any of the various inputs that drastically cuts down on the delay, and to do away with it completely I recommend buying a set of component AV cables for your game system for a full digital to digital signal (plus it looks fantastic).Next,  HDTV... As a DirecTV subscriber I was upset that it would cost me an additional $550-600 to convert my Tivo and dish to an HDTV set, and furious when I found out that only 3 of the four major local channels and five additional total choice stations were available in HD.  In my mind it wasn't worth the money to convert my service to HD for such a small number of channels.  I was also upset when I saw how crummy a SD broadcast looked on the new TV (due to the 640 lines being upconverted to the higher HD resolution of the set... its like taking a low rez photo and magnifying it to twice its size).  The solution?  Buy a $40-50 HDTV Indoor  Over-the-Air antenna!  Having the typical bad/fuzzy experience with bunny ear antennas in the past I was highly skeptical about the quality a simple antenna would produce, especially for HD broadcasts... I thought I was going to be proved right when I plugged in a Terk antenna I bought and tuned to our local Fox station only to see a bad reception with a lot of snow... of course what no one bothered to tell me was stations broadcast HD on a different channel!After fixing that problem we watched our first HD broadcast Monday night (\"24\") and I'm now a believer.  This set is awesome!  HD looks fantastic and our overall experience couldn't be better.  This set has more inputs than I have components, with the VGA input being a personal favorite, allowing me to run my iBook on the TV (crystal clear picture) and using iTunes and iChat at levels I never thought possible.  The remote needs more work, and less TV Guide plugs, but the on-screen menu is a joy to use.I highly recommend this TV and a Terk HDTVa antenna to go with it for local HD broadcasts.","Date":"March 30, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good Picture, Some usability issues","Author":"Thomas","ReviewID":"R1FBNGKEG3SQVD","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture on this TV seems very good.  I have used for DVD playback(progressive scan over component(on XBOX)), over the air HD reception, and playing XBOX games(Halo 2 over component cable).  The TV does all very well.I like the sound from the TV as well.  I am just using the TV's speakers for audio and it sounds great.Some of the features in the menu system are not very intuitive.  For instance, there is a DNIE demo function which shows half the screen with DNIE on and half with DNIE off.  It is not obvious how to set DNIE on or off after you see the demo.Also, The TV lets you create a favorite channels list for use in antenna mode.  It was not obvious how to tell the TV channel up/down buttons to only cycle through the favorite channels.  I hope this is possible otherwise it renders the favorite channels list useless.On other note.  Becareful buying this TV online.  You can not return it if you do.

First, we selected this 720p set because we didn't have any high definition (HD) inputs, and 1080p models were half again more expensive.  The Samsung DLP had good reviews both here and cnet, and it fit nicely in our space.  Though they weren't the cheapest mail order, Amazon was still $300 less than local electronics stores (including shipping) and with a $2k purchase we wanted someone trusted.Second, the ordering, shipping and delivery process couldn't be easier.  The shipping company emailed me with a response number seven days after ordering.  I called them back, gave them directions, we set up a day, they called an hour before, they showed up on time, unpacked the set and took away the packing material.  Clean and easy.TV worked fine straight out of the box.  Ten, count `em, 10 inputs! - 2 RF, 3 composite/S-video, 2 component, 1 VGA, 1 DCMI/DVI, and two 1394 Firewire (one in, one out) ports.  Connected our satellite receiver to the s-video and picture defaults looked very good with a standard definition TV signal.  Widescreen DVDs even better, but DVDs are still not HD.  TVs in general are getting as complicated to setup as computers.  This is part of a home theater with separate Dolby digital amp & 5.1.  With a TV, satellite, VCR, DVD, amp and computer, and all with their own remotes, any installation will not be simple.On a lark, got out an very old rooftop FM antenna (not TV), *laid* it on the ground in the front yard, and connected it.  *Wow*!  A perfect HD picture!  True, the signal strength was not high (we are 43 miles away according to antennaweb.org) but for an non-TV antenna on the *ground* - it still picked up 28 over the air stations, including 3 in HD.  All in all we've very happy with the picture.  There are lots of picture calibration controls if you need then, so far we have not.  I'm off to buy a good UHF TV antenna; all the HD channels here are in the UHF band.Now other things.  The Samsung remote is marginal; it controls the TV fine, but can't control the satellite receiver (*no* codes for satellite receivers are listed in the manual) and is of limited use with our combo VCR/DVD.  Even with the TV some functions take many clicks through a menu to operate, especially the picture-in-picture features.Bottom line: Great picture, great selection of inputs, lots of flexibility in set-up, easy order and delivery process.  On the other hand, any complete home theater setup can be a complicated, the Samsung remote requires lots of `clicks' to change settings and is limited in controlling other devices.","Date":"January 9, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV - But Beware of Rainbow Effect","Author":"Home Studio","ReviewID":"R35L39NGB2RP51","Overall":"good","Content":"First, let me explain that I hate to give this set a 3-star rating, because it's really quite incredible. Brilliant picture, very good sound, crisp HDTV reception from the built-in tuner when attached to simple rabbit ears (your mileage may vary), and worked great right out of the box.BUT...now that I've finally seen the dreaded \"rainbow effect,\" the picture is starting to drive me crazy, and I'm feeling the first stirrings of high ticket buyer's remorse.When trying to decide between big screen technologies, I went with DLP because of the lower cost, as well as the fact that there was no burn-in risk (and much of my viewing is still in standard 4:3 ratio...I can't stand the squeezed and zoomed efforts to fill a 16:9 screen by artificial means).I'd heard about the \"rainbow effect\" - where viewers see brightly colored rainbow flashes of color - but hadn't noticed the effect in the showrooms where I looked at DLP sets. To understand the \"rainbow effect,\" you need to know that DLP sets - from any manufacturer - can really only display one color at a time across the entire screen. By changing these colored pictures quickly on the screen, your brain artificially perceives the intermediate colors. And the effect is great.But if you move your eyes rapidly, looking from one part of the screen to the other, or if the picture on screen is moving wildly/rapidly, some viewers will see a trailing image in which the individual colors blink into existence. It happens as fast as a strobe light, and many (most?) people can't see it at all. But if you CAN see it, it may significantly reduce your viewing pleasure (my nice way of saying that you may throw your hands over your eyes and scream \"RAINBOWS!!! AIYEEE!\")I watched this set for a week without seeing anything, then I watched \"The Bourne Supremacy\" which is filled with jolting camera work and super-fast cuts. I saw rainbows EVERYwhere.  So my recommendation to anyone considering a DLP purchase is to find a way to spend some real time watching a real movie on the set before buying - not just 10 minutes in a showroom. In fact, take a copy of \"The Bourne Supremacy.\" If you don't see rainbows watching this film, you're home free.Summing up, I'd really say that this Samsung is a 5-star set, but if your eyes and brain pick up on the rainbow effect, you may only get 3-star enjoyment. So take the time to really watch a DLP picture before ruling out LCD or Plasma.","Date":"January 14, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV (technology) for the price","Author":"H. Sachan","ReviewID":"R3TCLX6YXYKOJW","Overall":"good","Content":"Here's a feedback which I left for HLP 4663 model TV also. HLRs are older than HLP and HLN models and the feedback below compares HLP/HLN/HLM. It does not has the number of input/output (composite/component etc) since that can easily be found on the product description page.This reviews pretty much applies to all the DLP level TVs from Samsung. I researched for around more than couple of months before finally buying this one.Samsung initially started with HLM/HLN series DLP models which were using HD2 chip from Texas Instruments and the contrast ratio was 1000:1. This performed very well in reviews, quality and black level as compared to Sony LCD rear projection.The next series is the latest on which is HLP xx63 series where xx is the size in diagonal (HLP 4663, HLP 5063). The improvements in this are 7 segment color wheel instead of 6-segment, which gives better color. This also uses 3rd generation chip HD3 which has contrast ratio of 1500:1. The bulb are also better in this one since there were some problems in the earlier version of the TV. This is a great TV, light weight as compared to some other and plasmas.The next series which is out only in 2 models is HLP 5085 and HLP5685. These are also 7-segment color wheel but they have HD2+ chip. This is 4th generation chip and is better than HD3. Its contrast ratio is 2500:1 which should mean better black levels. These are the ones with pedestal which looks cool in the picture but is kinda bulky looking in the store. I'm not sure why this model is not out in 46 inches, may be it doesn't make difference in smaller sizes.Next, 5th generation chip is going to be xHD3 and should give around 4500:1 contrast ratio.Overall, DLPs are better since they have better contrast than plasmas and weigh less. They also don't have a burn-in issue like plasmas. HLP series is the best one till now and Samsung is the oldest player in this.Other manufacturers are also catching up, so this should drive the price down further. good for consumers.Hope this helps and good luck shopping.--------Some more feedback on the picture and input modes after two weeks into the purchase:The contrast ratio of HLN/HLP series are good provided you are watching the TV at the same height. If you watch from slightly above/below or left/right, then you'll see it slightly less bright. Just like a laptop screen behaves, maye slightly better.It has following picture modes:- 4:3 standard definition (SD) cable programming. puts black bars on the side of the picture if you watch it in this mode.- wide mode (16:9). if you watch SD tv on this mode, it'll stretch the picture- panorama mode. stretches only the outside portion of the picture making center of the picture in the correct proporting (aspect ratio) but the sides bit distorted- zoom1/zoom2: they just soom in from the center with different stretching methods.Component inputs (in SD and HD) aspect ratios only have normal and wide options. Normal being a little pinched, while wide is normal.-----Some more feedback after 5 weeks of purchase.I started seeing some problems with the lamp. The manual says that when the bulb/lamp needs replacement, all the three lights on the front switch will start blinking. Atleast couple of times a day, the following was happening:- when I switch on the TV, the lamp will try to bring the picture while the audio was there- after couple of seconds tv will go to standby mode- it'll turn on again after couple of seconds and try to bring up the picture- and go again the loop to standby modesomething this happens 3-4 times and the pictures comes and sometime it just gives up and the tv turns off.I'm glad that I bought the warranty after couple of weeks from Circuit city itself, otherwise lamps are not covered in one year Sammy warranty.","Date":"December 8, 2005"}
{"Title":"Excellent HDTV and excellent delivery","Author":"DadofThree","ReviewID":"R3TW4RU15SWIEB","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my Samsung HL-R5067W for just about two weeks now and it has been a joy.  High-def is bright and clear, with DVDs very close behind.  Setup was easy and the TV worked well out of the box, although I agree with the other reviewer that everyone who spends this much on a TV should spend just a few minutes going through the settings to ensure it's all optimized.The only negative I've noticed: In dark areas that are out-of-focus, there tends to be a fair bit of video noise (pixelation).  Those aren't parts that your eyes typically go to (my wife never noticed until I pointed it out), but on a 50\" screen, it's more noticable.  This isn't a defect - just a side effect of the digital processing.  Other brands might handle it better, but at this bargain price for a 50\" true HDTV, it's a minor picture flaw.  The TV show \"24\" probably shows the most noise because of the camera work and heavy use of dark, out of focus backgrounds.  Shows like \"Without a Trace\" don't blur the background as much and are completely crystal clear - amazing.  Either way, this really is a minor point for me given the great bargain and overall amazing picture of this set.Ultimately, for the cost of a comparable plasma (around $4000) I got:- my Samsung DLP, that I consider to be equal in terms of picture quality- an Onkyo progressive-scan DVD changer- a beautiful HDTV \"console\" from Crate and Barreland ended up with a hefty amount of change left over on top of that.  Hard to beat the value proposition.Amazon.com's delivery service was excellent, by the way.  No problems, communication was great, and I received the TV on a Saturday afternoon (no time off from work!) right on schedule just three and a half days after placing my order!  Do yourself a favor, though, and DO understand Amazon.com's policy regarding returns, or lack thereof.  The risk was worth the cost savings to me - it might not be for you.","Date":"January 31, 2006"}

When comparing price and quality I felt I purchased a very good unit for the money.  At home in my family room the display is bright, sound quality very good and the performance of the HD capabilities when connected to my Comcast Cable simply dazzling.My favorite stores are Amazon and Best Buy, but when you include shipping costs, a discount using an Amazon Visa Card and the actual price, I was able to save over $450 by buying from Amazon ($1799 vs. over $2200 delivered plus tax from Best Buy.Delivery was flawless.  The shipping company called the day before and gave me a 4 hour target window for delivery.  On the day of the delivery they called 30 minutes prior to delivery to make sure I would be there.  The TV arrived in the box which was in perfect shapee.  The delivery people brought the TV into my house, put it on it's new stand and presented paper work for me to sign and they were on their way.I've read reviews with concerns about \"the rainbow effect\" of DLP TVs but I have never once noticed anything.

I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it.

A couple experiences that may help you:1. I use an antenna to grab free HD material. The quality of some of the channels (especially PBS HD) is almost beyond belief. Then there are some channels which are not so good, but my point is that with a good signal, this TV does wonders.2. The various options for input comes in real handy - the HDMI input gets an unconverted DVD signal, which is again, better quality than normal DVD.3. TV guide worked for a couple days after I connected the antenna. Now it simply says 'there's no data for this section'. I don't miss it much.4. More worrisome is a recent occurrence - the TV failed to start up a couple times - the green light blinks, but the screen never comes on. Not due to the lamp overheating - this was a cold start. It finally went away after pulling the power cord off. Not sure what the problem is - may have to call warranty on this.But as someone said before, issues are to be expected with new technology.

{"Title":"Very Good Choice and Great Delivery!","Author":"Philip T. Rodgers \"Phil\"","ReviewID":"RFB4SH3E4SYRN","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this TV from Amazon a little more than a week in advance of the Super Bowl a few weeks ago.  I was a little nervous about ordering something this large, fragile, and expensive online but took the risk.  Delivery time was estimated at about 7 days.  But only 2 days after I got notice it was shipped I got called by the delivery company that they wanted to deliver it the next day.  Amazing!  The TV was in great shape when it arrived and the delivery company unpacked it, moved it to my upstairs room, no questions asked.  How easy!This TV is a great size for the room I've got it in; our sitting area is about 8-10 feet away.  I ordered the HD digital cable from our local provider and...WOW...just incredible on those channels.  Even non-HD channels look good (in 4:3 aspect; I don't stretch it) on most channels.  However some regular cable channels don't look great.  This had been reported by some, like Consumer Reports, saying the picture quality suffered if viewing basic cable inputs.  Fortunately, all those channels have HD versions in our area so I can get over it.  There were absolutely no problems with its use straight out of the box.  No perceivable noise or sounds.  All the pixels seem to work great.  The sound is incredible.  We don't listen to it real loud most of time, so I don't often get the volume much above 10 or 11 (out of 30 or 40?  I don't know; haven't been up that high).  I know some have commented on the remote being confusing, but it turns out we use our digital cable remote to work the TV and so it doesn't matter in our case.There's also discussion about DLP vs LCD vs Plasma.  I was considering comparable Sony's LCD as well, but the price dropped significantly on the Samsung when I was ready to buy, and my amateur eyes couldn't perceive any significant difference between the two, standing in a brick-and-mortar store.  Plasma is the best, of course, but is just too freakin' expensive, and honestly once you get a DLP (or probably LCD) in the house, without a comparative plasma beside it, you'll forget about that comparison, unless you're a video afficionado or need something only 4 inches thin.  This DLP looks great in its own right and doesn't take up a lot of space in actuality.Overall, I'm very pleased with this Samsung HD TV and would recommend it highly.","Date":"February 22, 2006"}

I did a lot of research at retail stores prior to purchasing on Amazon.  Seeing the TV's up close helped me make my decision between the samsung DLP and various LCD and plasma sets.  I thought the picture looked much more crisp and sports looked much more clear (which is good considering I will be watching a lot of sports in the years to come!).  What made me buy from Amazon was the price was much lower than any retail store I could find, and the sales tax almost evened out with the delivery charge.I did have a major problem when the tv was delivered.  I had it delivered prior to my basement being finished.  The delivery people were told to keep it in the box since it would be a week or two until I needed it.  Probably a mistake on my part since when we did pull it out it would not turn on.  I proceeded to call Amazon who told me that they could not do anything and to call Samsung.  Samsung took all my information and contacted a service provider in my area.  The service person was able to come 3 days later and installed a brand new light engine.  I guess it was easier to replace the whole thing rather than try to find out what specifically was wrong.  He said that to do that out of warranty would be $1500 or so.  As a bonus I was able to see how to change the lamp now so I am ready when the time comes to do so.Once I had my HD direct tv and off air antenna hooked up I was amazed at the picture quality.  It looked even better than in the store!  The off air antenna works OK...I have some trouble 20% of the time.  But with a little tinkering the channel comes in. I hooked up an upconvert DVD player and it looks pretty good.  The sound is not 5.1 quality, but does the job for 99% of my viewing.I am very pleased with my TV.

I did not buy it from Amazon because of the returns policy for large screen TVs which is 100% abysmal, I got it from a local store.The TV only weighs around 70lbs and, as such, is dead easy to move if you need to. Warning!!! It is STILL a two-person lift! If you lay the TV flat the colorwheel WILL be moved out of position and the colors will be off until it gets reset by a technician.The TV has an embarrasment of inputs with 1 antenna (including ATSC decode), 1 cable (supports ClearQAM, unscrambled HD content) a digital Optical out (useful for getting the Dolby 5.1 ATSC signal to a home theatre system), 1 HDMI, 2 component, 3 SVideo and 2 RCA.All in all this TV is the BUSINESS! It picked up all of the Comcast analog channels and tuned in all of the ClearQAM unscrambled HD channels as well.HD picture from my HD DVR looks FANTASTIC (via HDMI) and DVDs from my BOSE progressive scan DVD player (via Component) are clear, sharp and wonderful.The sound from the colorwheel and the fans is unobtrusive and the color reproduction is superb.If you have a strong light source (like direct sunlight or high-frequency lighting) shining on the screen then the screen will reflect some of that light. Answer: Turn off the lights shining DIRECTLY on the screen and/or close some curtains!If you plan to sit less than five feet from this TV, DO NOT BUY IT!! You need to be at least 6 feet away for the best viewing and the close you sit the worse the viewing angle gets. Make sure your room can take a big TV.I have absolutely no regrets buying this TV at all and would recommend it to anyone providing they have a) the ability to receive an HD signal and b) the room to do this TV justice.","Date":"February 14, 2006"}

{"Title":"Initial troubles like one of the other reviewers","Author":"Robert","ReviewID":"R1TW0BRIO7CLLU","Overall":"good","Content":"I had some of the same issues as Dennis (Best HD Technology For The Price -- Get Extended Warranty). When the movers arrived the tv worked fine, but minutes after they left the tv picture froze, displaying a black and white image that looked like a photo negative. This is exactly what Dennis reported. I actually read Dennis' review but dismissed his problem thinking that these problems wouldn't happen to me. I assumed that any problems would show up within the first 10 or 20 minutes. The problem with that assumption is that many of the internal parts work fine until they're heated up, so the initial inspection wont reveal any issues until after the delivery guys have left. Some people may not be aware that Amazon doesn't do returns of tv's 27 inches or larger once the delivery guys leave. I knew this, but took the risk anyway.On the upside, the repairs were covered under the regular factory warranty, I didn't need an extended warranty of any kind. They had to replace the light engine, which would've cost $1350 + labor, but cost me nothing, thankfully. One thing to note is that the light engine and digital board, which break down the most, are generally on back order for several weeks so you may have to wait awhile. Another thing to be aware of is that although I live in Los Angeles where there are several authorize service centers, only one had enough parts on hand to come out and test my tv. They basically replace one component at a time until the problem goes away. So, if a service center doesn't have enough test parts on hand, then Samsung wont send them out. This could increase your wait time even more.One thing that I thought was pretty cool was that Samsung said they would replace my tv if the parts were on back order for more than a few weeks. It never came to that, but it was nice to know.After the repair guy fixed the tv, the regular analog cable signal looked pretty grainy. I should also say that it looked grainy when the delivery guys dropped it off, so it wasn't the repairman's fault. The repair guy told me that the tv is designed to display HD signals, not the regular analog signal. I was kind of disappointed because the local Time Warner Cable charges $60 a month for HDTV, it's not cheap. I naively thought I would get HDTV signals for the major stations (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, and WB). He said that regular analog signals would cease by the year 2009, so I'm hoping that at some point I can get basic HDTV for the same price I'm now paying for basic analog cable. Ok, I'm a little cheap, but I'm married and this is what it's like :)I gave it a 4 because even with the initial problems I had, Samsung honored their basic warranty and were pretty prompt, even with their back order problems. The tv is was still worth the $1700 I spent on it (after tax, after Amazon's sale price, their free delivery, the promotional code I found online, and the 1% off from my citibank card). The analog picture wasn't great, but it was good enough for me to await lower HDTV prices. It looks pretty good as a monitor when I'm playing downloaded tv shows from my computer. I can actually read the computer text. I play some emulated Super NES games from my computer and they look great on the 50 inch screen. The speakers are decent, I didn't even hook it up to my surround sound system yet. There are tons of inputs and features which you probably wont even use, but it's nice that they're there, just in case. The tv is fairly light, my wife and I can move it around very easily. It's not a big deal, but it's nice to know that it wont be a permanent monument wherever the delivery guys happen to put it.","Date":"March 13, 2006"}

The sound quality also  doesnt disappoint - virtual surround really does work and the tv has a good bass which bombs it out without the need for a huge speaker at the bottom. Its easy to set up straigt from the box and is just a fantastic piece of kit.One gripe is that it takes about 20 seconds to warm up nad i cant get the TV guide to stoip popping up at the begining but other than that it is an excellent addition to anyones home!!!","Date":"February 26, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great DLP","Author":"J. Hepler","ReviewID":"R20SQBFBLWKK1I","Overall":"good","Content":"Samsung was one of the first to jump on the DLP wagon and they did a good job with this set. I have had mine for over one year now and it has been a very good television. The HD picture quality is as good as I have seen on a projection unit (less than 1080p.) DVDs and video games look fantastic on the HL-R5067W.What does not look good, however, is regular definition content. Satellite or cable programming that is not in HD will be some what fuzzy and pixelated. Not so much that it is not watchable, though. This is a general issue with large DLP's and some LCD's though. It happens to be a bit worse with this particular model. On the other side of that, the HD image and DVD/Game picture was superior to the competitors.In summary, if you watch mostly standard definition still, DLP and particularly this set, is probably not for you. Perhaps consider a Plasma since they are now entering this price range. If you watch more higher resolution content or are a console gamer, this is the best DLP I have seen, and the price has really come down since the 1080p sets are out now.The remote control, hd-tuner, sound and osd are all solid and about the same as the competitors. This is a very good set, and even better at the current price.","Date":"April 11, 2007"}

{"Title":"Be prepared to upgrade everything else, or be dissatisfied!","Author":"Jay F.","ReviewID":"R1CFY2FJ81BMNG","Overall":"good","Content":"OK, let me first say that this TV CAN be great.  OTA broadcasts in HD are very nice.  Video games look very nice (especially Xbox 360, intended for HD).HOWEVER, gaming on lesser systems, like gen1 Xbox, PS2, GameCube, etc. will leave you with a half-second lag between the time you do something on the controller and when it actually happens on the screen.  For games where timing is important (most, though some more than others), this is a killer.  It has been said that setting your input to the \"GAME\" label addresses this, but it most certainly DOES NOT.NEXT, today's DVDs are meant for 480p resolution, so they must be upconverted (either by the TV or an upconverting DVD player) to display on this TV.  Even upconverted, many DVDs still look terrible, especially in darker scenes, where you will see all kinds of heavy distortion/blockiness and solid textures that appear to be moving (when they shouldn't be).  I assume (and hope) that once HD-DVD (or Blu-Ray) comes out, those DVDs will look perfect on this TV...  But don't expect it from standard DVDs that exist today.FINALLY, there is an issue of \"video lag\", where the video is a fraction of a second behind the audio (if you send your audio to your receiver for surround sound), creating a lip-sync problem.  It's not ALL the time, but MUCH of the time.  If your receiver has an audio delay feature, this can help, or you can buy a 3rd party audio delay device.  I see these as Band-Aids though, to address a problem in the TV that should not exist.  I feel that if the TV had this kind of issue, then it was not ready to be sold.SUMMARY:  This is a good TV that has potential to look great, but not without upgrading all your other equipment too.  This means potentially new (1) Receiver (for audio delay feature), (2) DVD player (to an upconverting model w/ HDMI, which will still be unsatisfactory in many cases -- hi-def DVD player and movies are the true solution here), (3) Gaming system (that natively supports 720p, so TV does not have to upconvert the signal, which is the supposed cause of the gaming response lag), (4) Cable service (standard cable looks pretty bad on this TV, need HD content) and/or OTA antenna (better results than same channels over HD cable).See this forum BEFORE you buy, it's dedicated to this particular TV, and has LOADS (too much for some) of info, good and bad!

It was definitely the way to go -- great value for the money and it is cool that we are ready whenever the cable/braodcast world goes HD.  The color is brilliant, features are extensive (a little confusing at first) -- sound is good even when not using our 5.1 DTS.  There is a very explicit warning about \"burn-in\" from channel logos, tickers, freeze-frame images, etc. but I think (hope) this is easily managed by avoiding such images and adjusting picture size.  Also be aware that the picture-in -picture (PIP) is limited in the sense that the TV itself has only one tuner -- but a second source and tuner (like a VCR) should work.  We have enjoyed many favorite movies and some new ones too since getting this TV three weeks ago.  You will see detail you didn't know existed and discover that those beautiful movie stars actually have complexion problems like the rest of us.  We used \"The Wizard of Oz\" as the benchmark to evaluate this TV, because is is so familiar -- and the richness of this 66-year old classic is nothing short of astounding.  Also -- unlike another reviewer reported, our picture needed no adjustment, and the settings you can adjust we did not find difficult to use.  A negative: when the delivery folks arrived they did not set up the TV, as promised in the Amazon description.  This was the most unnerving aspect of the whole transaction but everything turned out fine.  If you love movies this is a terrific TV.","Date":"January 16, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV at a Great Price","Author":"M. Douglas","ReviewID":"R8TMJ48UNRQ2N","Overall":"good","Content":"My wife and I were looking for a large TV to occupy some serious wall space and were directed by friends to look at DLP for the \"long term\" benefit.  After being warned by several about the dangers of plasma burn-in, and the gaudiness of the old-school rear projection TV, we did some independent research and a lot of store viewings.1.  DLP is crummy from any angle other than directly in front.  The bulbs range in time from several hundred hours to a couple thousand - which means that during that crucial playoff game, you're back to your old school 25inch CRT, relegated to the guest bedroom tv.  That's the real reason you kept her around.2.  Rear Projection is pretty much the same, albeit cheaper for the same quality, and should come with a pre-installed Magnum PI and Knight Rider video show because this is the TV of the 80s.3.  This newest generation of plasma TVs is less likely to burn-in than my old CRT, and  have the means to correct the burn-in if images start to appear at any time. Which means permanent plasma burn-in is BS unless you are an airport, school, or other public information conveyor that never checks their equipment.  I checked and we apparently aren't, so we looked closer at the plasma option.  Bottom line:  Plasma looks brighter, better for longer than any other TV out there.  When I'm standing 70 degrees to the side, I can still see the whole picture - when I push the on button, I don't have to wait and pray that the lamps will heat up without popping.  And in spite of my love for old school tv shows that will probably never make it to HD, the plasma looks great for anything on it's gloriously sleek screen - standard or hi-def.Samsung has a winner here - the TV was cheaper than I could buy on a military base without tax, and it was delivered quickly and took almost no time to set up.  There are plenty of connection options, and the menu options for setup are so simple, I can actually understand them.  The TV was 90 lbs - so it isn't flimsy in any way - and the design is pleasant, not overstated, and nowhere near as instrusive as a rear projection box.  We've already put about 150 hours on the tv, and no problems (other than the addictive quality of playoff games in HD - you can see the texture of the grass, the game ball, and the announcer's toupee - it really is amazing).A word of caution:  In spite of the low price, this is definetly an enviable Keeping up with the Jones item. Be prepared to sever friendships and test loyalties after purchasing this tv - it makes you look rich without having sold children or body parts to get one.

Bleeding colors, multiple images and washouts have made viewing impossible.

The biggest downside for us is that it consumes 600watts of power - $20/month or $240/year where we live - compared to projection 50\" my friend bought at 60watts (1 tenth = $2/month or $24/year).","Date":"November 27, 2008"}

{"Title":"Over 5 years and still going strong","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R2296L2OUFD2NC","Overall":"good","Content":"Maybe this TV is a freak ... many others died after only 4 years of use. Some less then that.I bought this unit while serving in the USNavy (reenlistment bonus gift to myself) and have used it exclusively since. When I was at sea my family was using it. There was a time period of about 6 months where it was in storage during a household move. Non climate controlled box storage (like PODS but cheaper). I was worried it would be useless after that but once I got it setup again it went right on shining without a hiccup at all.No Samsung plasma whine. Deep blacks and rich colors. Right along with massive power consumption .... these things are NOT energy star compliant. It will also heat up a small room during winter.These were/are fine TV's that go all the way up to 1080I (not P though) for a decent price and last for years. These days? they are old, big bezel, heavy (93lbs?), power hungry dinosaurs.Oh and btw I bought it for $1500 at the end of 2005. So the 2 ninnies who think a used one is worth that much in 2011 better hope their potential buyer doesn't research the interwebs. Considering they are selling on Amazon, I don't think they have a bright future as purveyors of fine electronics.So in conclusion ... if you can get one for a couple hundred bucks and you need a decent TV by today's standards, go for it ... otherwise, get something newer.","Date":"July 25, 2011"}
{"Title":"Everything I could have asked for","Author":"PointLisse \"acraigl\"","ReviewID":"R11IIWONN511RY","Overall":"good","Content":"First let me say that Amazon provided a great experience for this purchase. My TV was delivered 2 days after my order was placed and the delivery company was courteous and competent. They unpacked the item, brought it to the room and tested it for basic function (power, menu, etc.).The TV itself is awesome. Colors are accurate (I get no sense I need to adjust them), and the screen is sharp and bright. It took a bit of time to set up inputs, but I was up-and-running in less than 1/2 hour. Some have complained that SD (standard definition) is less than adequate. I agree that is does not hold a candle to HD, it is certainly watchable on this screen (possibly due to the DNie technology). Stuff from TiVo is fine, but \"important\" recordings such as movies and network dramas (Lost, 24, etc) will most certainly go onto the HD DVR.I use a universal remote (Logitech Harmony 688 - highly recommended), but the TV remote was logical and easy enough to work. The picture is absolutely gorgeous (NCAA tourney -- just in time, yeah!) and I'm regularly astounded by HD nature shows. Just, wow!Not sure what else to say, except that after all my research, price-to-performance, and overall value, this TV delivers. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.","Date":"March 20, 2006"}

{"Title":"Simply delightful","Author":"Charlie","ReviewID":"R1XM5XG6MSUXOF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for a few weeks now and have no complaints at all.  I researched small to midsize LCDs and plasmas pretty thoroughly, and so far I'm very happy I went with this Panasonic.  Here are a few observations on some points you're probably familiar with if you've been reading reviews and stats:LCD vs. Plasma: Some of the plasmas I saw were admittedly impressive.  But for me the 42\" minimum was a bit too big.  And plasmas are real energy hogs: A 42-incher runs at well over 500 watts (compared with less than 150 for this LCD).  That's a lot of heat to be pouring out for hours every day.  Plasmas are also much more fragile.  It's important to remember that LCD is a newer technology, and reviews from even a year ago may be misleading because of improvements since. That's particularly true of poor refresh rates -- not a problem with this TV.Viewing Angle:  If you move to the side significantly, colors will definitely start washing out, with the effect pretty noticeable at 45 degrees or so.  I can see where that might be annoying for some people, but I was aware of that aspect ahead of time, and it doesn't bother me -- I have no trouble getting the TV and my butt lined up straight.  Two people at either end of a couch with the screen 7 feet away or more will not notice any color drop-off.Bad Pixels:  This concerned me when I first read about LCDs, but it's been a complete non-issue.  Don't know if I got lucky with  a perfect screen or any dead ones are just unnoticeable, but either way, I'd say don't worry about it.Contrast & Black:  Maybe plasmas and conventional CRTs do crank out marginally deeper blacks, but again, it's not an issue.  The picture is bright, sharp and vivid, and you simply won't find yourself saying, \"Damn, I wish those blacks were blacker.\"High Definition:  Limiting a TV like this to standard definition is like buying a Corvette to drive around the Target parking lot.  If you don't have access to HD or plan to get it soon, hold off on the purchase -- electronics all get cheaper with time anyway. But when you do go to HD, you won't be disappointed. The nature shows on Discovery HD are stunning.  (BTW, most network prime-time shows and sports are available in HD now.  Cable generally offers it, and Directv should beam it down by year's end; and your local network channels probably broadcast HD on UHF.)Inputs:  The flexibility of the multiple inputs on the set is great.  You can hook up each component separately with the best connection it can use; e.g., HDMI for a high-def receiver, component video for a DVD player and A/V plugs for a VCR.All in all, a great TV.  I love it.","Date":"October 27, 2005"}

{"Title":"Difference between 32LX50 and32LX20","Author":"DeeJayCee","ReviewID":"R25G8CA2UTA84N","Overall":"good","Content":"Reprinted from [...]:It is amazing how much can change in the LCD TV industry in the blink of an eye. Less than a month ago we reviewed Panasonic's largest LCD offering, the TC-32LX20. A month later its replacement, the Panasonic TC-32LX50, is shipping. With the TC-32LX50 you'll have to blink your eyes a little faster not to miss a change in picture - the new Panasonic's response time is 14ms, beating its predecessor by a quick 2 milliseconds. Along with improved response time the replacement model includes other subtle changes to the screen. Panasonic scaled back the feature lineup on the newer model. Major changes were made to the TC-32LX20's controversial styling. We were universally impressed with both of the TVs. Picture, features, and value are all top-notch. We review the Panasonic TC-32LX20 LCD TV in-depth here, commenting on changes made in its replacement, the Panasonic TC-32LX50 LCD TV. Both TVs receive the same overall score, an impressive 95/100.The Panasonic TC-32LX20 and TC-32LX50 LCD TVs are 32-inch offerings in the VIERA line of flat panel displays. The Panasonic VIERA line is direct competition with the AQUOS line from Sharp, the LCD king. Panasonic, which is heavily invested in building plasma displays, hasn't fallen behind Sharp in the LCD race. Panasonic's highly styled TC-32LX20-era VIERA plasmas and LCDs look like TVs out of the future, while the latest generation of Panasonics, including the TC-32LX50, and Sharp LCD models are staid in appearance. Both manufacturers' lines of displays are excellent and a consumer looking for a high-end HDTV built on LCD technology can't go wrong with either.The Panasonic TC-32LX20's screen is surrounded by a dark black frame, which is in turn surrounded by silver plastic. The Panasonic TC-32LX20 LCD Television has speakers on the sides, where as the TC-32LX50's are located on the bottom. Panasonic reserves the space below the screen on the TC-32LX20 for a treasure trove of controls and inputs, including digital camera media card slots and composite RCA jacks. Panasonic lays a piece of tinted glass over the TC-32LX20's LCD screen area that overlaps the speaker bezels along the sides. The extra glass layer creates a sense of depth. The design is by no means orthodox. Like it or not, the TC-32LX20's design catches your eye and stands out from Sharp and Sony's offerings. Depending on your taste you may or may not be sad to see that for the TC-32LX50 LCD TV Panasonic went with a black frame and bottom mounted silver speakers for a more orthodox look. We suspect the TC-32LX20's radical design was Panasonic's attempt to scream for attention as it carved out early market share in the LCD market; the TC-32LX50 is gracefully styled to let you concentrate exclusively on the TV's picture, its best feature.","Date":"December 4, 2005"}

{"Title":"Not for analog signals","Author":"ZBatia \"cyber teacher\"","ReviewID":"R1EF9N5XS75JP6","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV for our kitchen because I wanted to see what is written on a screen, and don't see clearly our 42\" TV from faraway in a living room (open space with a kitchen). The new TV has a great set of features including an ability to change the size of the screen (wide, normal, and the ZOOM mode is really great). Similar TVs from Samsung and Sharp have terrible sound and are underpowered. This TV has 6 Watt amplifier, and I use it at 40%. Overall, I am satisfied with the TV even the quality of an image sent over the cable (Comcast) is terrible. You may ask why I am satisfied. If you look at it from 5-7' distance, the picture is quite good. I am planning to change the cable and to use the digital signals. The quality of signal will be much-much better. The TV has a very stable base, tints pretty well, and also can be tinted horizontally (I love it because depending where you are staying in the kitchen; you can always adjust the screen for better viewing). There are several video inputs that I did not explore, yet. The remote control is simple and efficient; also you can use the buttons on a top of TV.The 19\" size can be great for any bedroom, as well.I'll provide more details soon.OK, I have used the TV for about 5 months. To my surprise, the quality of the image has not improved when I connected it to the digital signal from my DVR with a Comcast digital cable.I went to the BestBuy to verify my assumptions. None of the LCD TVs of this size (except expensive Sony ~$1000) have better quality of image: all of them suffer from worse quality if to compare to the same size conventional TV. The only way to watch this kind of TVs and see no image problems is to sit at least 6-10' away from the TV. You may ask me: Would you buy this TV now? My answer is NO. For those who use LCD TV to watch the DVD movie, it is justified but for me it's not.I respect the Panasonic brand for many years. I don't think that Panasonic released a poor quality product; I'd rather blame the technology. Sony used more advanced technology, and therefore, the quality of image is consistently better.","Date":"March 1, 2006"}

I don't know if it is  going to hold up perfectly for years to come, but the initial experience is great.  If it breaks, then I will certainly revise my review, but so far, so good.I got this for a great price on clearance.

Chase-Stone","ReviewID":"R36RCGJ2GFUH0B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this LCD TV for 2 years without any major issues.1) PictureI use it as my PC monitor and have HD Cable hooked up to it as well. Since it is not 1080p I know I am not getting the best picture from the cable, but pictures on my PC a look fine. Does motion blur a little with sports and car racing.2) RemoteI see many reviews of people complaining about remotes in general, but to me these are the same people who can't program VCRs (as they said in the old days (90s)-haha). Anyway this remote is very straight forward, one you understand the functions of \"Menu\" and \"Enter\"3) SpeakersNice looking. Pretty loud. Setting goes from 0 - 100. Its seams 1-30, 30-60,60-100 are fairly distinctive sound levels4) General appearance - Looks clean. Stand is stylish5) Size & Wt - Pretty thin and light6) Inputs - The are on both sides (including speaker output) and have DVI (for computer). Not that there are multiple forms of DVI6) PIP - Great. multiple size or even split 50/50. Bad thing is the PIP is surrounded by blue line which temperarily burns in.7) CON - Burn in. Since I use this for PC Monitor, there are many websites that have the majority of the screen stationary. That image will burn in tempararily. So far nothing stays. However, I always make sure my screen saver is working. Also, as a PC we almost never turn this TV off.8) Recommendation - I bought for around $600 from Sears. I haven't noticed this brand around as much as other newer names like Olevia, Westinghouse, etc. However, I would recommend at price more like $350 or less in today's market. However, you will only find Protron on Ebay, etc since there was a lawsuit between the company and suppliers. Overall this TV has been worth the cost I paid. I hope is last for another few years.General recommendation when buying from companies like Sear and WalMart - be weary of their specif Brands (just as Kenmore products from Sears). They basically spec out to suppliers and go with the cheapest (which means service sucks unless Sears supports it and you are buying a cheaper made product).","Date":"March 8, 2008"}

Although my experience so far has been with the local HD channels using an over the air HD antenna, it has still proven its worth the money.I come home every night after work wanting to watch TV on a \"nice\" TV. Sure there might be minor tweaks that you can do to enhance the picture but come on, It's not that noticable and definately not worth $500 to get a guy to come tune it for you. Out of the box this TV does very well. The red is a little sharp but its nothing you cant easily take care of going through the settings. The overall picture quality is absolutely beautiful when watching HD TV. I got to see our Minnesota Vikings get the crap beaten out of them by the Bengals with outstanding quality.With the large screen size that it has, watching TV series programs like \"Lost\" etc. really make a difference.I also purchased the GW12 TV Stand and it looks amazing in the house. Be aware how ever to make sure you have enough room for the TV in your living room. I had to move some of my couches back to the dining room to get a more comfortable viewing distance, but since I know Ill be moving out soon I knew it wouldnt be too bad for too long. But make sure you have at least 12 feet of distance to the TV screen. Remember that the TV is about 3 feet deep and that you will want to calculate that into your measurements as well. The Sony TV stand is shaped perfectly for the TV so there's no excessive space taken up.To use the full power of the TV I purchased the HD DVR from Direct TV to be able to record everything I miss and still be able to watch it in HD. HD programs are much more clear, vivid and sharper than what they looked like on your standard TV.One con is the lack of picture in picture. You'd think it would be nice with a TV this big but I suppose Sony had a reason for dropping it.The Speakers are pretty nice for the size of the TV but with a screen that big you should consider purchasing a home theater system or receiver set with seperate speakers.The remote control is kind of corny looking but hey its not the main point here.TV is also very light weight for its size and ways at about 150lbs.Overall I definately love this TV and think it was well worth the price. I looked into buying a DLP but it just didnt catch my eye as much as this rear projection LCD. Sony has definately improved the darkness of the black on the LCD TV's knowing that there were problems in the past.","Date":"September 21, 2005"}

{"Title":"Pleased with my 42\" A10","Author":"J. B. Mccord","ReviewID":"R111GFN29U1G57","Overall":"good","Content":"Well, after wayyy too much research and hemming and hawing, I finally decided on this 3LCD RPT by Sony. What finally swayed me was the sweet combination of picture quality (PQ) and price.  In side by side comparisons I just couldn't detect enough (with my eyes at least) PQ difference between this RPT and the plasma tv's to justify spending twice the money.  While standard definition signals are only mediocre, the HD and DVD signals are simply awesome.  I use component cables and a Motorola set top box (stb) provided by Adelphia.  The side to side viewing angle is greatly improved over previous generations of projection tv's (as is the brightness and crispness), but beware; the vertical viewing angle is quite narrow. My built-in media niche is elevated a bit, which puts the tv above my head when seated on the couch.  There is a very slight dimming from this angle.  However, it's nothing that I haven't been able to compensate for with some picture adjustments (or a subtle shim ;-)).  The remote has a \"Wega Gate\" feature that works kind of like the \"Start\" button in MS Windows.  I think it's pretty user friendly, but I don't use it much since I mostly just use the remote from the Adelphia stb.  As an engineer, I also appreciate the other features this LCD RPT technology offers over plasma. It uses less energy, generates less heat (a factor when building it into a wall unit with tight clearances), it's light enough for one person to move around (the salesperson in the store carried this 42\" tv singlehanded!), the plastic screen has less glare than glass, and the single bulb is user serviceable. Best of all; no burn-in issue to worry about!  Just plug it in and start watching tv, use it as a computer monitor (I haven't tried this yet), or just run a static image all week.  Who cares! Sony offers this tv in a 50\" version, but because our viewing distance is 8'-10', I didn't want to go any bigger.  If you get too close to these screens you will see some screen door effect.  After having this tv for several weeks now, I can honestly say that I am very pleased with my purchase.","Date":"September 9, 2005"}
{"Title":"TV: 4 stars; Amazon: 0","Author":"J. Naylor","ReviewID":"R3HOOZ0QBAA43X","Overall":"good","Content":"So, the price was great; much cheaper than the local brick and mortar electronic stores at the time I was originally making the purchase.. TV is wonderful. Seeing this TV side by side the Samsung DLP's in the stores convinced me I made the better choice. The picture is fantastic, great features. I only wish it had PIP, but I'll survive. I work from home, and I also have set up my laptop to use the TV as a monitor... It is working out really well..Now to Amazon, and some of the chaos I endured in taking shipment... Please don't make the same mistakes I made; this experience tainted my view of Amazon, and below I note some things that may prevent you from going through the same hell..The delivery guys showed up on time on delivery day.. Upon climbing out of the truck, I was handed the paperwork and was asked to sign before they even pulled it out of the truck (<--Mistake 1). After the TV was brought up into my apartment, the delivery guys left. I immediately opened the TV to find it completely destroyed. I stopped the driver before he left, and told him to take the TV back; he told me to call Amazon and he'd pickup the TV when he came to deliver me a new one, which Amazon would replace; they then drove off (<--Mistake 2). Upon calling Amazon, I was ultimately told that the TV is mine if I signed for it and if I didn't get it back on the delivery truck for return, because there is a 'no-return' policy on large merchandise, which I understood. Regardless, AMAZON HAD NO INTEREST IN HELPING ME, THE CONSUMER, OUT. Reading through the shipping and no-return policy; I noted that the shipper was supposed to unpack the TV, let me inspect it, and then remove the packing material. Since they did none of the above, and noted this to Amazon, I felt as if they should have supported me. Instead, they took in my report, threw it to a team who never cared to personally call me, and then wrote me an email saying the case was closed, because they had information stating that I asked for the shippers to NOT unpack the TV. Which was a lie. Nobody from Amazon was willing to negotiate the issue in my behalf with the shipping company. There is no direct number to call Amazon, they call you from an 'unknown' number so you can't call back. Amazon ran away from me.I made a last ditch effort to call the shipping company, Eagle, who was EXTREMELY polite, understanding, and they negotiated with Amazon the pickup and replacement of my TV. Now THAT is a classy and moral corporation; only if those guys would go into business selling the products :D. After they accepted the blame, Amazon came through with an email apoloziging for the inconveniences I was caused, for simply not believing me. In the end, one month after ordering the TV, I finally took shipment of a working set, which was properly delivered. Take note, prices at the local stores in this timeframe dropped to a level where I could have bought it locally for only a few dollars more, with the security of a return policy, and someone you can interact with if the transaction doesn't go smoothly.Seriously, would you think I'm ordering anything ever again from such a fair-weathered company? May I suggest you think twice as well?","Date":"March 9, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV To Complete Your Home Theater","Author":"Michael K. Zupan \"mzupeman2\"","ReviewID":"RW93CD620GPKT","Overall":"good","Content":"I had spent some time researching what kind of TV it was I wanted to blow my money on.  You can't just buy any old TV anymore, you need to research so you can best suit your own needs.  I personally watch a lot of DVD's and play a lot of video games.  So, I needed something that was going to handle games well, and most of all make DVD's look stunning!The television's design is sleek and stunning.  It only weights about 60-65 pounds so you can move it yourself with ease.The display is very bright and vibrant.  The TV when you recieve it, has its settings set to contrast and other settings that would make the TV look absolutely magnificent for store displays but will in the long run burn out your bulb faster, and fortunately, those settings aren't the true correct settings you want anyway.  Set the 'vibrant' picture settings to 'standard', you may want to add your tint a few notches over to the right a little bit to get a more true red color, reduce your color a little bit, but in the end it's all just minor adjustments you are going to need to make.If you watch a lot of DVD's like I do, if you sit far back enough, they look magnificent watching them with progressive scan and component cables.  But if you sit a little closer than you're supposed to like I do, you'll notice all the imperfections that you would see due to the fact that DVD's are not as high in definition as a high definition TV, because DVD's were made to look perfect on standard TV's.  You could see some boxes in some high movement, artifacts here and there, but this TV offers numerous ways to adjust the picture to your liking.  There's DVD players now that 'upconvert' with technology a DVD that's got a 480i resolution, to 720p by adding lines and throwing out some of the noise on a DVD.  But with this TV it's not necessary with the 'Digital Reality Creation' feature (DRC).  This helps to upconvert the image to be somewhat closer to HD standards, by adding 4x the lines (twice as many horizontally and then twice as many vertically).  This isn't going to give you a high definition image mind you, but you can use this function to adjust the clarity and 'reality' of the image to smooth out imperfections and artifacts that are created by a lot of movement.  There's even a function on the TV that lets you adjust just how much 'noise' you want filtered from a picture.Now, all this could be a pain if you were to have to continually make these kinds of adjustments between different inputs on your set and your digital/HD cable, but this TV will save your presets for each input.  It may take you some time to get the best possible picture that you want from each component, but the time is worth it because you only need to do it once for each function and it saves them forever.Great set for a great price.  Worth the cash.","Date":"November 15, 2005"}
{"Title":"My first HDTV and I love it.","Author":"J. Park","ReviewID":"R3RUWJ3COUNMSH","Overall":"good","Content":"I had considered the Samsung 4667 46\" DLP HDTV and was all set to buy it when the Sony 42A10 showed up. I was at the store and I had a chance to compare the picture quality of both. I am one of the population who is susceptible to the rainbow effect of DLP's as I found out when looking at the Samsung. The 42A10 is part of the newest generation of LCD rear projection tv's from Sony and the picture quality shows it...the colors are bright and crisp. The improvement in picture quality is noticeable in comparison even to last year's Sony models. I bought the Sin City DVD specifically to flex the 42A10's muscles with my progressive scan dvd player...I was not disappointed and my friend who borrowed the dvd to play in his Sony 50A10 concurred with such adjectives as 'amazing.'The only downside is sometimes during rapid image movement there is noticeable pixelation (artifacts) but I am confident this is due to the Adelphia HDTV Motorola set top cable box which is something I am stuck with rather than chosen. I also wish there were 2 HDMI i/o slots (having only 1 slot is not unique just to the Sony models) instead of one as I am using the sole port for an HDMI-to-DVI cable to my HD cablebox which prevents me from using an HDMI-to-HDMI tv to dvd player connection. LG will supposedly be introducing 2 HDMI slots in their next gen models and LG uses a newer generation of Texas Instruments' DLP technology over Samsung from what I have learned. Stay with HDMI or component cables...the composite, s-video and coaxial cables result in a noticeable reduction in picture quality. On a separate note, the footlong remote control not only looks ungainly but is really useless for cable viewing unless you use the CableCard technology...probably a sly way of convincing people to pay $300 for the glitzy bells and whistles Sony universal remote.Regardless, in my visit to the store to do some direct in-person comparisons I could honestly not find a brighter clearer picture among rear projection HDTV's than the new Sony's. The Sony's are second only to true LCD and Plasma tv's which have their price and screen burn-in issues but the quality of the Sony's have closed the gap.I haven't watched so much PBS (which is broadcast separately in a 24hr HD channel) since my childhood watching Sesame Street. I have a hard time going back to watch regular digital cable channels because now they just look like garbage especially in the normal 4:3 aspect ratio. I love my tv...when driving home from work, I wonder what's going to be on for me to gaze at while I kick my heels up...when was the last time you felt that on your way home from a long day at work?

For me, my digital/HD channels no longer came in when this happened.  After doing a \"reset to factory settings\" as described in the manual, the TV went back to normal.  My guess is that TV's software/firmware has got a bug.  I did an online chat with the tech support from Sony but that had no clue.  I can only hope that our complants will get them to find a fix for the problem.  I've got a call into the local Sony repair folks, maybe that can fix it as I'm happy the reset cleared the problem but I don't want to be going this on a regular basis.

{"Title":"HDTV quality at reasonable price","Author":"Holly K \"Book addict\"","ReviewID":"R2ODAX4RNAMH6O","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great TV!  Provides great HD quality but at a price well below flat panel LCD or Plasma screens.  The quality of picture, in HD or regular, is great, even in a room with lots of light.  The whole unit is not very deep (see specs) so doesn't have to sit way out.  The side bezel is amazingly small so no space wasted on each side by plastic filler or speakers.  Check out the weight... it is light and can be moved MUCH easier than the traditional CRT TVs of past.  It also will likely sit on your old TV stand since not much wider than the screen itself.  Speakers are at bottom and, for TV speakers, are just fine.  Unit is very clean looking so doesn't overpower the room yet looks up-to-date.  It includes over-the-air tuner for traditional signals AND for high def signals. (Prior models did not have built-in HDTV tuner, an expensive option).  If you put up an antenna you can get HD signals over the air at NO charge and picture is perfect (assuming antenna can reach station)...we have canceled cable and just use over-the-air HD broadcasts!  Includes diagnostic signal meter for signal strenth.  Sony also includes CableCard option for those with cable and unit includes all types of inputs & outputs so plenty of options.  The prices on these keep dropping so watch.  Only con I can think of is there is not a true picture-in-picture (two active stations at once)...at least I can't find it; and most TV stands are wider than this unit as they were designed before Sony made these so compact.  And did I mention the picture quality?  It is superb.  We've had unit some six months and are very pleased.","Date":"January 23, 2006"}

I originally wanted the 50\", but it would have been too big for our situation.  We are about 9 - 10 ft. from the TV when watching it, and it seems to be the perfect distance.I've had the TV for two weeks, and currently have it on basic analog cable and am thrilled with the picture quality.  I'm expecting it to get even better when I upgrade to digital cable and HDTV in a couple of weeks.  DVD's look awesome (Finding Nemo was absolutely incredible!), and the tv is super easy to use.  I basically got it home, hooked it up to the cable and DVD player, let it run through it's automatic station set up, and haven't done a thing since.  CC provides a DVD to help adjust all the settings, but I have not used it yet.  I have not had to make an adjustment and it looks great.  I did buy the 4-year extended warranty that covers the replacement of the light - the light costs $200, and CC will give you at least one, even of the old one does not burn out in the warranty period.  So far, couldn't be happier.Update:  3/01/2006I purchased the Terk Indoor HDTV Antenna (#TRK HDTVI) just for kicks to see if it could pick up any HD while I wait for another week for the cable company.  I plugged it in, and ran the set up program on the tv for the antenna.  Much to my shock, it picked up a bunch of stations in HD and looks fantastic.  I live around 30 miles north of Chicago, and NBC, ABC, PBS, FOX, WGN all have fantastic over-ari HD reception.  I am going to cancel the cable company visit and save the money!","Date":"February 27, 2006"}

After reading tons of reviews we took the plunge.  Frankly I was a bit intimidated by some of what I read regarding color calibration.

We are so thrilled by the positive facets of this HDTV that we are blinded by anything negative.  We just love it.The picture quality is breathtaking.  I realize I am repeating myself but my enthusiasm provokes it. The manual was not very difficult to follow.  It was suggested by a friend that we use the THX option on a DVD to do a video calibration.  Of which we did and it just seemed to all fall right in to place, not to say their were any radical changes from the default.  Just some minor tweaking for our tastes and eyes.We put on the new Star Wars DVD Revenge of the Seth.  We feel that a movie theater will never do for us again.  It was like we were there.  As if one could stick out their hand and feel the shape on a cruiser flying by and the field depth was just astounding.This was a investment that we know will bring our family endless hours of enjoyment, but also to a new peak of entrainment that was way beyond our comprehension.

{"Title":"Completely Happy, now if Comcast & HDDVD...","Author":"M. Daneker","ReviewID":"RQOTC9FWNQCOF","Overall":"good","Content":"This was a major investment, $1600.00 is enough to make me paranoid just to own it. The downside is that the bulb assembly is $275 from Sony and eventually the bulb WILL need to be replaced.Haven't noticed any issues anyone else had, but I bought mine in Feb. '06 and I see most of the purchases here where in '05 not long after the model was released. Now, onto the specifics.I wanted the 50\" but couldn't fit it in the space I had, so I settled on 42\" but am still very happy. The TV is NOT out-of-the-box friendly, if you are not savvy have a tech set it up and set all your picture adjustments. It took me weeks and weeks and still six months later I am tweaking it out for best quality. Firstly, there are the basic controls, contrast, sharp, color, etc. but there is a Normal, Vivid and Custom settings on the main imputes (including HDMI)so listen close, go into custom and try all the settings with various images until you are happy, and read the manual!Now, how does it look? Well the 1080i I get from comcast is great, mostly, but that comcast has sheeting issues (you see those damned little square digital images when the screen gets busy) best viewed 10' -  18' from TV and looks great. Dead blacks, good whites (never quite pure, but the winter snow in Narnia & LOTR looks great!) I also have a 480p DVD player (can't wait for HD!) which looks better than standard Cable, not as good as HDTV but again, from about 12 feet away it's near flawless and I'm happy.The only thing is, when I have HDMI input from comcast I get no optical audio out to my receiver, but I believe this is a Comcast / Motorola (these boxes, suck) issue, not the TV.Take advantage of the three component inputs for your DVD, PS(2) and GameCube! Both look awesome on here! There is a setting to stretch the 4:3 image to 16:9 with a bit of clipping on top and bottom and a bit of stretching that makes the picture look almost perfect even though it wasn't actually a widescreen image. I use wireless controllers and play from 12' away and the games look crystal clear.Also, this is an LCD so interlaced and progressive scan look equally good. The TV doesn't have a flicker, it shows all lines at once by storing half in memory for 1/30 of a second and then showing all scan lines at once! It looks great.The downside? Regular cable sucks! We must have all HD and now! Regular channels don't fill the screen (of course) and tend to have a lot of digital sheeting.I love this TV but, get a spare light from Sony right away (it's easily changeable) and stick it over you closet! It could be 2 or 5 or 10 years, but if it blows you have no TV until they can ship a new one! Mines worked perfectly since the moment I plugged it in, so you get no complaints here.Also note, this TV has no burn in and no moving parts but for a cooling fan! Regular DLPs have a spinning wheel (or now three!!!) and can make a lot of noise or break down more easily.This TV is also so light one person can lift, and it can be mounted on a wall.","Date":"June 12, 2006"}

I was very pleased with the picture at first, but quickly became overwhelmed by the number of rainbows I was seeing.  I'm very glad I purchased it from a local brick and mortar store because I was easily able to arrange a return.  They came to my house, picked up my old set and set up my new sony, all for no charge.After 5 months, I'm still very pleased with my 2nd choice.  When I go to my friend's houses which have plasmas, I notice that although my set may not be as bright as theirs, the clarity and quality of the picture is much better on mine.  Using the vga input to connect to my computer is fun, but the resolution isn't quite enough for me to play WOW.  I hope this will change in a few years.  I spend a lot of time playing console games and watching dvds on this set.  If you spend most of your time watching cable tv, don't bother getting this set. Get a standard CRT. The huge picture makes low quality images look worse, not better.  In fact, after I got this set I canceled cable tv because the picture made me want to cry.  I will happily wait for my favorite shows(such as Battlestar Galactica) to come out on dvd so that I can see them in their full glory.  I watch this tv from about 8.5' and it seems to be the perfect distance.  My major complaints about this tv are not really about the tv at all, but the lack of high quality material to play on it.  I find it really annoying when I'm watching something in 3:4 format and a third of my screen isn't being used.

{"Title":"Spectacular Value","Author":"B. Vrooman","ReviewID":"RQ3V2JPIOYDZE","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32\" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV.For comparison, I am moving from a 26\" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great.My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault.I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200.My last \"pro\" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40\" wide across the front, that's a good thing.","Date":"October 1, 2006"}

One light source behind the viewer has been working fine with me.- Not usable in totally dark room (it's like watching a sun in your living room, and you really can't mess with the contrast/brightness that much if you want decent black level and grayscales)- Fan noise is audible in silent passes- Overscan, viewable image area is 12xx*67x (can't remember exactly)- Doesn't work as a PC display (it isn't meant to be one anyways), internal processing chips mess up the image so badly.To sum it up, I'd buy this (or the 50\" one if you have enough space) if you need a new television, unless you a) need still bigger image or b) have money for true 1920*1080 1080p INPUT&DISPLAY; with HDCP projector/tv.","Date":"May 9, 2006"}

{"Title":"Not too happy","Author":"D. Lazic \"Zgembo\"","ReviewID":"R19A35LFKKYRZJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV about a month ago. I had no problems setting it up. I even had no problems getting local HD chanels over-air FREE. I was so happy. However, once I got cable...my mood changed. I reliazed that if the signal coming in is not High Def. then the picture can be \"grainy\" (little boxes around images) when there is a fast movement on the screen. Fast movements such as those in basketball games, soccer games, or simply person speaking.This is due to the signal coming in not being HIGH enough so it is streched over the screen. Here is explanation from SONY website:\"Inferior picture quality may occur on a High-Definition Television (HDTV) with a screen size over 36 inches when viewing a standard-definition signal. This is because the lines of resolution provided by a standard-definition signal are enlarged in order to properly fill the screen. Enlarging the lines of resolution not only increases the size of the video image, but will also make it easier to see video noise in the picture that causes distortion. For this reason, the picture quality on a HDTV is best when viewing a high-definition signal.\"I do have HD programing, and those are great, but there are very few chanels at this time, what do I do with other 200 standard digital chanels? If the signal coming in is not HD, then it should just give regular picture. But it does not, its all grainy and anoying.END RESULT: I was happy with the purchase until I realized that the regular standard digital cable chanels will always be grainy and not \"normal\". HD chanels are perfect, but there are very few HD chanells out there.","Date":"June 26, 2006"}

I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty.  As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on \"high\" and is loud.  This did not happen until the software was updated.  I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work.  The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced.........  Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty.  I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered).  Otherwise, the TV is perfect.","Date":"August 5, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent TV, great picture quality, definitely recommended","Author":"DJ Robin","ReviewID":"R2N7IQDQ8K55EY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have all good things to say about my KDF-E42A10.  I have been nothing but pleased with my purchase and HD Channels look like still images... just soooo crisp and clear... Thanx to my HD PVR box from Rogers (here in Canada), I can record my shows in HD and view at leisure...One thing that I found somewhat bothersome with the TV was the way the HDMI input works.  I have my HD PVR box hooked up with the TV directly using an HDMI cable.  Also I have a digital coax cable connecting the digital audio out from the HD PVR to the A/V Receiver.  Only problem though, even if the HD broadcast is in Dolby Digital 5.1, I get only 2 channel sound on the A/V Receiver.  In order to get 5.1 Channel DD sound, I have to get into the Settings of my HD PVR Receiver, change the Audio to :Dolby Digital\" from \"HDMI\" to get 5.1 channel DD sound.  That's a few extra steps that I don't really want to take if I don't have to.  If I leave the \"Dolby Digital\" selected in the settings, I get no sound from the TV at all.  So when I'm done watching a show in 5.1 DD sound, I need to switch back to the \"HDMI\" audio mode so that the TV sound can funtion normally and everyone at home doesn't go nuts trying to get sound out of the TV.  Anyone else experience this?  Let me know.  This behavior is however, not depicted if I use Component Video Cables... weird!Everything else about the TV is great!Peace!Robin","Date":"February 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"Never thought a Rear-Projection TV could look and sound this good...","Author":"S. Chaudhry","ReviewID":"RNNC074E7NJ5W","Overall":"good","Content":"I have always been somewhat prejudiced against rear-projection TVs. Mostly because I judge them based purely on the way they used to be in the 1990s; Huge and heavy that never showed a clear picture or sound...the kind where you could not see a thing on the screen unless you were sitting dead-on in front of it.This Sony WEGA LCD Rear-Projection TV has changed my outlook towards its brethren completely. I honestly never thought in my wildest dreams that a rear-projection TV can looks this good and sound this amazing. Honestly, it has the best sound system I have ever heard in a TV by far, from loud booming bass to directional sound...yes, I said directional. The TV makes it sound like surround sound straight from its somewhat hidden speakers. I don't know how it does it, but it does.Moving onto the display, it is bright, crisp, and comes with a plethora of options and customizations to suit your viewing taste. HD Channels come to life in the clearest and crispest picture I have ever seen. And you have a variety of options for viewing non-HD channels.Since the TV takes input up to 1080i I have all my devices (Xbox 360, Digital Cable, DVD player) hooked up to it with nothing less than component cables. The devices that can natively transmit in HD, such as the Xbox 360, flourish on this TV. I have never been so immersed in the sights and sounds of video games before!Viewing angles: there are close to none! You can see this TV from an INCREDIBLY wide range! We have one of those TV stands where the top swivels, but we never have to even move it regardless of where we are sitting in the living room...the picture is just as crisp and clear no matter which side and however large of an angle you view it from.The only angle you have to watch out for is vertical/height. I did notice a bit of difference in the picture if you are standing up or sitting down (depending on the height of the TV compared to yours). But even that is only if you are standing within 4-feet of the TV.Lastly, the one factor that basically sealed the deal for me with this TV is the fact that you can replace the lamp yourself. The lamp has a life of 1.5 to 2 years (depending on how much you watch the TV) and spare ones can be bought straight from Sony or from a variety of places online for under $200. To replace it, you just open a hatch on the side of the TV (no screws), take out the old lamp cartridge, put in the new one. Yes, that's it! Additionally the TV itself actually tells you when it is time to replace the lamp...there is a light that comes on when the TV notices that your lamp is approaching the end of its life. Our TV still has its original lamp in it and it is close to 2 years old. I bought a spare lamp online just in case, but I haven't had to use it yet; the picture is still crisp and clear as it was the very first day.","Date":"March 9, 2007"}

Strangely though, Amazon projected my item to take almost 3 weeks to arrive?I have been very impressed with picture quality on HD channels.  Additionally, the quality of non-HD channels is far superior to any DLP projection TVs.  If you are comparing the 2 technologies, go to a local retailer and have them turn off the HD signal and switch to analog, you will be amazed at the difference between Sony's 3LCD technology and any other set with DLP.  Just do it, I promise you'll be shocked.Also, I'm tired of reading complaint's about the cycling through of the video inputs, and how many people haven't found the \"SKIP\" setting Sony has provided so you only have to cycle through the video settings that you use on a regular basis. I have my DVD Player on setting 1, my Video game on setting 2, and my HDTV cable box on setting 7.

So we decided to purchase it. The TV itself was really light too so it was a lot easier geting this thing in the house than getting our incredibly ancient Sony CRT out. Before we got this TV, I hardly even ever watch TV (because mainly my dad watches his programs), but I always find myself watching Discovery HD now (which I highly recommend anyone who has a HDTV preferably with 1080 support getting)(VRY NAICE! AH LHAIKE!).By the way, the TV goes up to 1080i; a reminder for people who are looking to buy this to play their new Sony Playstation 3's with. PS3's support 1080p, and if your TV does not support this, it will play at 480 (booo). On the other hand Xbox360 and Nintendo Wii owners, this TV would be a great buy!Overall: No problems since the time we bought it (Couple of months now), Superb picture quality, Good price...GREAT VALUE!","Date":"November 25, 2006"}

I have also owned a 56\" Samsung DLP rear projection for 6 months longer.  The Sony has provided years of perfect performance, with a sharp, well lit picture, and only recently have I installed a new lamp.

It's discouraging.  I may very well buy one of these used models. Before you buy, research the reliability of the TV you intend to buy.  It's sad to think that my old tube Hitachi still runs, after 22 years and the industry seems to think that with the new HD technology, buyers will be happy with a good, long 5 years before the capacitors blow, and you're either expected to pay out $300 or more to fix your TV or send your TV off with the local Waste Management truck!

Seems like allot in today's money. But I've been extremely happy with this set and never regretted my purchase.I have multiple HD sources(blu-ray and cable HD) both look great. Just one tip, make sure your cable box is set to \"pass-through\"...so that your TV does the signaling(720P, 1080i) and not the cable box. Some cable boxes will take totally over and just feed your set a 1080i signal. Some people think this is fine, being a videonut, no thanks.Once the picture is calibrated, it is pretty spectacular and looks amazing. 42\" was the right size for the room, not too big and not too small. I sit about 9 feet away. And the viewing angles are great on this set.My last set was a Sony and I got a good 13 years from it. It still working great.

{"Title":"Very happy football fan !!!","Author":"Theodore M. Amenta \"Breckenridge Realtor\"","ReviewID":"R2014X1ZWLMSTC","Overall":"good","Content":"My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.All in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner.","Date":"September 21, 2006"}

I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away.  I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television.

I have standard (not HD) cable.The picture is absolutely gorgeous right of the box! I have not felt any urge at all to try to tweak the color balance.  It does come with three \"picture mode\" options (vivid, standard, pro) which I did change from the default setting.The Sony switches channels very quickly making channel hopping convenient, and the remote has a Jump button to quickly go between two channels.My initial plan was to place this near my computer and use it as a second monitor during commericals, however switching between video inputs is rather slow so I gave up on that idea.  You have to either cycle forward through all 6 external inputs, or use the WEGA Gate (on-screen menus) to go directly to the input -- both approaches are somewhat awkward.It would have been extremely nice to get around the video input switching awkwardness if you could just open a second window to view/swap another external input, but there is no support for that.Not mentioned in the product description is that the box also contains 5-foot VGA cable for hooking into a computer and a coax cable for standard CATV use.","Date":"October 1, 2005"}

{"Title":"Bravo Bravia","Author":"J. Cowles","ReviewID":"R3HKX35BCXDB2N","Overall":"good","Content":"For my situation, this medium screen LCD HDTV has been an excellent choice.  Picture is crystal clear, sound is excellent and has some \"surround\" characteristics even without the home theater turned on.The set has multiple inputs for several combinations of video devices.  I currently run a VCR (still have some old tapes I don't want to trash), a DVD (standard but will accommodate HD-DVD), and a digital cable box.  One caution with many cable providers - I run the cable box through the HDMI input even though my provider doesn't support this method.  I have had only one problem with the HDMI image and unplugging the cable box for 10 seconds allowed it to reset itself to show an HDMI digital image again.  ALL cable companies are compatible with component video inputs.  This television has one component video input, so running a DVD and a cable box to it simultaneously will require an adaptor if that is your situation.  In my case that hasn't been necessary to this point, but it wouldn't be a problem if need be, since I wouldn't be watching a DVD and a digital broadcast simultaneously anyway.  Again - this is because of the cable provider, not the television.  Some may choose this option anyway because HDMI cable is pretty expensive at this point.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this television.  It also fit very nicely in my somewhat small entertainment center because the speakers are on the bottom, not the sides.","Date":"March 17, 2006"}

I'm only disappointed that had I looked around a little more I could have got a bigger TV for less, though I probably would have sacrificed some quality. I am sorry for those who have written such negative reviews, the only thing I can think is that they did not hook it up right or they got a faulty product, because I know mine works wonderfully and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay a little extra for high quality.","Date":"August 14, 2007"}

I typically watch the HDTV in the living room, then go to my bedroom to watch this TV, and I think this picture still looks really good. The size and weight are ... formidable, so be ready to work hard to get it where you want it, and do get a heavy duty stand, because it weighs over 200 lbs, and if you try to swap out a 32 incher for this you may find your stand flattened like a roadside squirrel. The only complaint I have with this TV is that it occasionally emits a high-pitched buzz for 30 seconds or so, and then goes back to quiet. Until flat-panel TV's get much, much cheaper, this TV is an excellent alternative for decent screen size and sub-1000 dollar price.","Date":"December 26, 2005"}

Horton \"writer\"","ReviewID":"R3POPN6TUASCCJ","Overall":"good","Content":"Having finally obtained an HDTV after enormous hassle with Amazon (anyone else notice all the fraudulent listings up here?) I ordered this particular television for around $400. Due to the negative reviews posted by other viewers, I was almost expecting something to be wrong with mine (mind you, I've had it for less than a week so far) but instead have found myself quite delighted with it. My model did not experience any color problems that others have reported, but looked crisp and richly colored. After setting it up with my 5.1 surround sound system, my 1080i HDTV tuner, my cable, and my HDTV antenna, I was able to sit in my smallish bedroom and be caught up in rapturous visuals and thundering sound (with the surround sound cranked up). Another neat feature was the nifty side panel which allowed for easy hookup to my computer (which has an S-Video out). I was headbanging to my massive MP3 collection and watching streaming broadband video on my new TV, and was almost in digital nirvana :-)The remote takes a little getting used to, but if you are smart with your settings you can really squeeze the most features out of your system. Overall, this television ended up being perfect for my digitally-wired bedroom.","Date":"September 8, 2005"}
{"Title":"Not a great set, but it is a good one.","Author":"C. Prescott","ReviewID":"R3T8MZ58T5BKR6","Overall":"good","Content":"Greetings, I purchased this T.V. quite some time ago and I have been able to work out most of its quirks. From what I have seen the T.V. has 3 basic problems: 1. The color settings and the color red are way, way to high when you first start up this set. I found that I had to turn the color down to almost a 1/4 on the on screen display and in the red/green control I have it almost entirely green. After messing around with it for awhile I am quite satisfied with the results. 2. the second problems is that this T.V. isn't exactly top of the line. It lacks the 720 or enhanced T.V. options and does not support HDMI. However this T.V. does support 420p, 420i, and 1080i, so DVDs and HI-Def T.V. channels look awsome, and the widescreen is a really nice feature on this set. 3. The final problem is that if you have the T.V. set to have it display normal T.V. in the 4:3 ratio you get grey bars on the side of the T.V. but they are not always grey, depending on the brightness of the picture, on the screen, they sometimes shift between light and dark grey which can be distracting, you can strech the picture so you don't have the bars, but then the picture can look a little distorted. In conclusion, I feel that these are minor problems overall. If you can get this set for $400 or less, then that alone can override all the problems I just listed. This is a good set, it won't look as good as those 40+\" plasma T.V.s you see in the stores, but if you compare price and features between them and this T.V. you can get alot for your money from this set. Thank you, and I hope that this review is helpful to you.","Date":"September 6, 2005"}

{"Title":"High Quality and High Weight","Author":"The Review Man \"J-Lew\"","ReviewID":"R2ECQL26W37M9K","Overall":"good","Content":"Working at a retail store this was the first wide-screen high-definition TV we carried.  While working I would find myself staring into the clear picture that this TV had.  At the time the television cost around $700.  I knew this beautiful machine would eventually be mine.  After two years the TV finally went on clearance, so I decided to pick it up.  The only problem I have with it is when I first carried it down the stairs with my father.  The television is heavy and bulky, but i could not be mad at the low price I got it for.  Once situated the TV looks great.  The picture on the television is clear and great with my progressive scan DVD player.  Movies come out with a clear and crisp picture.  Movies in wide-screen do have letterboxes, but they are reduced and some I have watched even eliminated the box.  The picture on regular cable looks fine as well.  I would recommend high definition cable though if it is available.  Setup was easy and quick.  From what I have read many consumers have experienced a problem with the picture having funny colors when the TV is turned on.  This did not happen for me at home, or for the display at the retailer I work at.  The television has not failed me for the half a year that I have owned it.  Overall, if you are looking for a wide-screen high-definition television with a low price, this one will meet your demand.  The price of this television makes up for the bulky size.  With a surround system, it creates a personal theater like performance.  Make sure you have a space for it and enjoy.","Date":"November 15, 2005"}

The pros are, of course, HDTV capabilities. It also has decent sound and good picture quality. The cons are no HDMI/DVI interface so no digital connectivity. Also, there is no 720p support so you are forced to go with 480p or 1080i. Something others may be concerned about: When connecting to a computer there is significant overscan and you need to drop the resolution down to get 1080i support. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.","Date":"September 3, 2005"}
{"Title":"Not too bad... but","Author":"bought a samsung","ReviewID":"R3MBPNXLYAFRSD","Overall":"good","Content":"For less than $350, this is a great widescreen tv.  It got to my home almost a week before what Amazon said it was going to (which was very nice) so I got to enjoy it sooner.  The big gripe I have about this tv is that if you utilize the component inputs with your DVD player, you will still have the letterboxes.  A friend of mine got a 52\" rear projection, widescreen tv and it automatically adjusts the screen to completely eliminate the letterboxes, I assumed (incorrectly) that this feature was native to all widescreen tvs.  Although some other Samsung widescreen tvs do have this feature (I did some researching afterward)this one does not.  Also, when you first get the tv and set it up and you notice some psychedelic colors on the edge of the screen; don't worry -- just let it sit turned off for a few hours and it should be just fine.Bottom line, if you want to watch widescreen DVDs without the letter boxes, don't buy this tv.  If you want to get a good, budget priced widescreen tv with good quality picture and you can still live with a little bit of a letter box; this is the widescreen for you.P.S. I know that I said that it doesn't eliminate the letter boxes; what it DOES do, however, is significantly reduce them.","Date":"September 7, 2005"}

{"Title":"Philips 23PF5320 23\" Flat Panel LCD TV","Author":"TJ","ReviewID":"R1UFUS0RS32KLW","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV primarily because it is lightweight which meant I could get a state of the art TV without having to pay more than twice the price of a cheaper analog tv for a piece of furniture sturdy enough for it to sit on.  That being said,  I already own a 17\" Philips LCD TV that I use as a computer monitor/tv.  I was confident I could expect the same quality when purchasing another Philips LCD TV and I was not disappointed.  There are a few differences. For instance the 23\" has surround sound and probably because of the enhanced sound features I can't use the satellite remote to change volume or turn the monitor off  (Of course I did it myself without reading the manual so maybe there's a trick to it).I have had no regrets about this purchase.  The onscreen menus are easily accessible and rather intuitive for the programmer.  Consequently, I had the Philips set up with in 15 minutes of taking it out of the box.  The sound is so rich and resonant I find myself using the lower volume settings when I'm actually in the living room with the TV. The factory settings for picture quality have been great except for a minor change I made from cool to warm tones.  Another plus, there are numerous connections for a/v equipment on the back of the TV.  I connected a DVD player a few weeks later, also without having to use the manual.","Date":"February 23, 2006"}

The previous reviews were right on the money. The pros: great resolution, lower price for a 23\" tv than other competitors. The cons: small channel indicator on screen (its difficult to see); a one second delay as you move from channel to channel; we also noticed the lowest sound setting is still fairly loud.  After I received the tv in the mail, I noticed a white hue around each edge of the screen when the background was dark. If you were on a totally black screen, the white hue was easily apparant. Unfortunately, it would bleed into darker colors when watching a dvd or tv. Not a lot, but enough to notice that it was a problem. I had to send the tv back to Philips ($20 via UPS), and they replaced some parts on it. When I received it tv back, the problem was still there, just not as noticable. I'm now going to contact Philips about getting a new replacement, or Amazon to get my money back.  Hopefully this tv was a one off problem.","Date":"March 20, 2006"}

I could hear sound effects as if I had a basic surround sound system.The small gripes I have is that the channel change is just one beat too slow and for some reason the remote is only responsive to extra-hard depression from the finger, but that is a small price to pay for excellent quality and a tremendous price for 23\" of television real estate.","Date":"January 19, 2006"}

We already own a 34\" HD widescreen Panasonic that we use in the living room.  Needed something smaller and less expensive for the bedroom.My review is based on using the set over the weekend. I will update if warrented in a few weeks.The set is a flat panel LCD, very attractive. Setup was fairly easy and intuitive.  I have mine hooked up to an HD Cable box using component cables, and a standard set of audio cables. The manul does not make it clear, but the coax-in is located on a detachable cover on the rear side of the TV.  I do not use the provided remote, as I programmed cablevision's remote to change channels & volume.As for PQ, there are several pre-set modes and one \"personal\" mode. The \"personal\" mode lets you choose your desired PQ settings for bightness, color, contrast, and Tint. I find the presets to push way too much red, and way too bright. I used my own settings and will calibrate with my DVE disk down the road.The audio is good, with adjustments available for bass and treble.  HOWEVER, I cannot change the tint as it is grayed out on the screen. I called Phillips this morn, and they told me I have to disconnect the cable box to make the adjustments. Will try that tonight.

Our bedroom is 10x12, and this is the perfect size for the space.  With LCD prices dropping, I was tempted to get a 32\" Samsung 52 series, but this TV is less than half the price.  For my needs a 32\" would actually be too big, since we can't get far enough away from it to see the picture clearly. So, for a smaller TV you have the choice between the 26\" models and this.  I could not justify the $700-$800 price of the 26\" over this model.  When you look at them in a store (J&R; here in NYC), the 23\" and 26\" seems to be almost the same size.I use an HDMI->DVI cable to connect a Panasonic DVD player and analog audio connections for sound.  I have the DVD player set at 1080i output. We use this exclusively for watching DVDs since we don't get cable or any TV channels.  The picture has good color and action movies look fine with no blur or choppiness/hesitation.  I did notice some minor artifacts when watching a very dark movie (\"The Illusionist\").  Also, in dark scenes you can see some light bleeding at the edges of the panel. These are minor quibbles that I expected from an LCD in this price range. The sound from the TV is fine as long as you aren't too picky. Overall, I would highly recommend this TV.PS: don't be a sucker for overpriced HDMI cables (like Monster), the cheapies work fine.  There is Philips-branded HDMI to DVD cable on Amazon that is pleasant looking and less than 20 bucks.","Date":"February 6, 2007"}

The TV has a great picture but from level 1-10 on the sound there is no change in volume which is a nuisance. At this sound level the TV is hard to fall asleep too and forget it if you don't set the timer and an infomercial comes on in the middles of the night because it's going to wake you up.My only other complaint is turning on and off the TV. If you turn the TV off using the button on the TV you can't turn it back on with the remote. To me this is very strange and took a little getting use to but now it's not a big deal.I have had my TV for almost 2 years and use it in the kitchen now because the of the volume issues but over all it has been a good TV.","Date":"March 10, 2010"}

The picture is excellent when playing DVDs, but somewhat grainy with regular cable (a problem with other TVs as well). The remote is tiny and it is next to impossible to see the buttons in low light (so buy a new remote. . .). The channel images on the screen are also too small and the time delay when switching channels requires patience. The worse part of the equation is the volume. As others have said, the volume on setting \"1\" is too loud. Guess it is good for the price, but I wouldn't buy again.","Date":"May 5, 2009"}

I paid about $350 + shipping for the TV and was very pleased until December 2008 when I went to turn it on one day and NOTHING! I have no idea what the problem was & cannot imagine what led to it~ The TV was wall mounted (by contractor), NOT hooked up to cable,as I used a simple antenna, and I did have a DVD player connected to the TV. Filed a claim with warranty provider & the TV was repaired & sent back to me.  I tried 3 different times to call and find out what the problem had been but was never able to get an answer. Seems to be working fine but I'm keeping my fingers crossed since the warranty has expired!!Update: Dec 2012~ I just changed my review from 3 stars to 5 because Tv has worked great ever since- no problems whatsoever!","Date":"March 4, 2009"}

The reason I give it 4 star is that it's not a good TV, compared with my 14\" DAEWOO CRT TV. I think this is due to the low contrast of this machine.

{"Title":"Good TV. If Wall mounting, READ ON:","Author":"Nazareth geek","ReviewID":"R39O5VX2ZD6AQ0","Overall":"good","Content":"First thing: I bought this tv from Target walk-in after seeing it here.  Great picture for SD 4:3. Very good sound (5 watts/channel vs. 2 or 3 w/c for comparables).  Near complete input selection (coax, composite, s-video, component, DVI-I). A good tv for this class IF NOT WALL MOUNTED.  If you plan to use the included stand exclusively, this seems to be a worthwhile tv.Backstory:  Bought tv as a gift to be wall mounted in a kitchen on an articulating arm.  Chose a Peerless SA730P articulating mount for 10-24\" flat screens (a quality mount from a respected company).  Tv to be mounted about 5' high, with slight tilt down to table.  Arm to swivel tv around for cooking/cleanup viewing.  Tilt to be locked, arm extension and rotation allowed for viewing.Problem:  The mounting point for an external mount (VESA 100 standard) is on the BOTTOM OF THE INCLUDED STAND!  That's right.  The stand pictured above is not removed to reveal a mount point in the center of the tv's back, but pivoted back 90 behind the speakers revealing the VESA 100 bolt pattern on the bottom.  This moves the tv out from the wall by about 3-4\". But, more important, it moves the tv up and out from the mount point MULTIPLYING the weight of the tv.  Imagine holding the tv from a handle centered in the back of the screen.  Now imagine supporting the same tv from a 4\" lever connected to the bottom of the tv.Result:  Failure of the mount to hold the tv with anything over a perceptible tilt down.  I returned the tv and bought another brands' 4:3 20\" lcd.  The stand included with this tv unbolted from the VESA 100 pattern centered on the back of the screen (as I think is the norm).  The articulated mount has since functioned well and as planned, with plenty of movement.  The bummer is I think the picture was better, and I know the sound was, with the Philips.","Date":"December 30, 2006"}

I thought that 20\" would be too small but the clarity leaves that thought behind.My biggest problem is with the remote control and menu functions, they're clumsy, inconvenient, incomplete.Nutshell: If you've liked the picture on an LCD flat screen, this is not THAAAAaaat much better.Pros:+Great picture with unsplit cable connection+Can change picture format with one button+Change Color format with one button+Good sound**+Change sound format with one button+Looks good even when off+PIP when using as PC monitor-to-TV**+Smooth Sleek remote+Some nice remote functionsCons for TV:-May need color adjustments-Clock...?

Lamp costs have come WAY DOWN over the years... about $70.00 online now. The HD picture quality is stunning! The sound is huge! Configuration options are very flexable.

We did experience a dead bulb very early on and Toshiba warranty replaced the bulb plus added 2 years to the warranty. Since that bulb, we've not had to replace it. The TV does have some peculiar behaviors, like the fans running all the time or the occasional no antenna signal for HD channels (yes, over the air). We paid $2400 back in 2006 for this and it's still a relative bargain for the size to cost ratio. In short, it's a great 1080i TV for the size, cost and function. The picture is great and it's been hanging on for about 3 years now. I just wish DLP was still as readily available, LCD and Plasma is just too high cost for the size - and frankly DLP works great.

{"Title":"Great buy for the price !!","Author":"TheCypher","ReviewID":"R1OUEOMLIWSZ6Y","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV a month ago at Circuit City for $1799. I am extremly pleased with it so far. The picture quality is excellent for DVD with progressive scan and the picture quality for standard def TV is also pretty good. I have hooked it up to HDTV via DISH Network Satellite and the picture quality is amazing. Discovery Channel simply blows you away. NBA games on TNTHD are also great. I compared it side by side with other makes in the store like Panasonic, Sharp, Samsung etc. I did not find any big difference in picture quality. Then again in the stores the big problem is they don't adjust the picture on all the sets for optimum picture. As a result the best TV may look really bad. The price difference in any case was not worth it for me. I was looking for something good but inexpensive for the bedroom. I have the TV wall mounted in my bedroom and it looks great. So far I am very pleased with it.A couple of things to note:1. Volume Control Bar: Many people have complained in their reviews here that it does not display a volume control bar. This is actually a setting. Your TV is configured for minimal screen information. If you change this setting you will see the volume control bar. You will also see a channel indicator at the top left corner. When the TV is set to minimal screen info mode the channel indicator disappears and so also the volume control bar.2. Built-in Speakers: Again a lot of people have complained that the built in speakers are bad. I don't think I agree with this. The speakers are decent. Although I have hooked up my TV with a home theater system, majority of the time when I am watching regular TV I just use the built in speakers and they work just fine. I have not observed any vibration or any distortion at higher volumes. I only use the home theater when I am watching movies or DVDs.3. Auto-formatting of picture: Again I have found that this works just fine. Sometimes it takes a couple of secs to determine the optimal format before resizing the picture. You can always change the format if you don't like what you see. I set it to \"Auto-Format\" majority of the time and it works just fine.TV has a lot of inputs including 2 HDMI inputs which are best for HDTV viewing, component video for progressive scan DVD, S-Video as well as standard composite video inputs. Also has USB port for connecting external devices like a USB drive or digital camera to view images on the TV. I have not tried this yet. The other feature I have not tried is the PIP (Picture in Picture). I have to admit the manual is very basic. Then again there was a DVD or CD that came with the TV and I haven't checked that out yet. May be it has advanced setup instructions.Setup was breezy. No hassles. Had it up and running in minutes using the included table stand till I had it wall-mounted.Overall an excellent buy. You get more than what you pay for.","Date":"June 5, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great buy for the price and quality","Author":"Electronic Lover","ReviewID":"R2KMMO9KQV0WCI","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is simply great for the price. I had done research before buying this TV and concluded to three brands before buying it. They were Panasonic, Phillips and Samsung. I was also comparing 50 inch plasma as well. After reading reviews, checking models in CC and other stores, based on the price and picture quality Phillips was the winner. I would still say if you have more money go for Panasonic because they have better colors than Phillips but not as worth of $800 extra. Plus once you put HD using component cables or HDMI, it is just mind blowing. I would like to comment on one of the review here which says picture is grainy from near and it is not looking good. I think that's true out of the box on first day because you are not using HD cable box and even component hookups. When I took out the TV of the box and hooked up with the cable directly, picture was really mediocre and I was really disappointed. Next day when I got the HD Cable box and hooked up with component cables then I got to see the actual pic quality and it is really amazing.Sometime even if you have a component hookup make sure that you are watching the TV through that connection and not other as other simple cable connection will not have as good pic as component or HDMI. You can press AV+ button on the remote and it will tell you which connection you are using. I was actually using plain cable for a while before I realized that I need to change the source to component using AV+ button. Another point is, you might have to adjust brightness, contrast, and others to get the best quality as out of the box settings are not that good.Another point to note,  If you are using cable box make sure you have 4:3 setting is set to 480i or 480p and not to `stretched'. This will change the quality of your digital and analog channel otherwise they will look horrible. You can do this by turning off the cable box and press menu from the cable box remote. You can also verify that your HD is set to 1080i on the same screen.Other plus point is it has plenty of connections. I have watched DVD through this TV and pic is really great. I use the `automatic' setting on the menu for picture size as it automatically fits the screen where it is 4:3 this would help to reduce any burn in issues.In overall it requires some tweaking and make sure you play with this for couple of weeks because then only you will get the all the settings right. In the end it has great pic quality and under 2k you can not beat this unit.","Date":"January 11, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great HDTV Plasma","Author":"DB","ReviewID":"R2JQT2TS2GACP6","Overall":"good","Content":"I think this is a fantastic plasma for the money (Amazon has it listed at $1899 at the time of this review).  I have had this TV for about 3 weeks now, and I have few complaints.  I usually suffer major bouts of buyer's remorse after a purchase like this, but not this time!my thoughts:1. I think the picture is fantastic.  Maybe I am just not enough of a videophile to appreciate the difference between this picture and competing brands or technologies, but head down to your local Best Buy or Costco if you need to see for yourself.  What i can tell you is that the picture blows away my old 32 inch analog.  HDTV is amazingly clear, and looks beautiful on this set.2. the set itself is georgeous.  i waited this long to buy an HDTV because i wanted a plasma i could afford...again, some of the competing technologies may be cheaper or better or whatever, but for pure form factor, the flat panel is impossible to beat.3. i think the internal speakers are a plus.  a home theater system is certainly a great complement for this (or any) TV, but it's also nice to keep it simple when watching a basic program like the news - you don't have to worry about multiple remotes and turning on multiple machines.  Just flip on the TV and your ready to go.4. this TV is well prepared for the future.  most HDTV plasmas at this price point don't have the HDTV tuner built in and don't include any HDMI inputs.  This set not only has the tuner built in, but includes 2 HDMI inputs, plus the cable card slot, plus all the other component and S-video and audio inputs/outputs.make sure you connect it to your video source via component or HDMI cables...it really does make a difference!","Date":"December 10, 2005"}
{"Title":"Excellent video quality, some bothersome design flaws","Author":"M. E. Varela","ReviewID":"RBO4HVCMNWCC0","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this plasma TV on Dec 21, 2005.  I am an electrical engineer with over 40 years of experience in industrial and consumer electronic equipment. I find that this TV set has a beautiful image rendition. Colors are superb and has a lot of automatic image tuning features. But, on the other hand, it also suffers from a series of design flaws that I think only an experienced techincal person can stand. For starters the closed captions circuit becomes \"disconnected\" from the channel you are viewing and the only way of getting them back is by turning the set off and on again. Once they are working it will not bother you again until you turn the set off for the night. The next time you use the set you may again need to do the \"off/on\" routine.  Also, although less frequent, you will get a picture without sound. Again the \"off/on\" routine will save the day. This affect all inputs.  Technically speaking this is due to the TV set \"control software\" (which is user-upgradable) not being able to \"soft-connect\" all the required circuits (C.C., sound, OSD, etc..) correctly. Turning the set off and on will \"reboot\" this software.  So, because I know what is going on and because some day Philips might fix all of this thru a software upgrade, I have decided to co-exist peacefully with it.THIS IS AN UPDATE - SEPT 2008. So far this set have required four visits from the Sears serviceman. First, the plasma screen driver for the upper half failed. Repaired under the service contract. Second, when changing A/V inputs it took about 90 seconds for the change to be completed. Again repaired under the service contract.Third, Now the screen lower half driver failed. Again repaired under the service contract. Fourth, the screen failed altogether. Sears replaced all the insides of the set (including the screen itself) except for the A/V board.  The strange thing is that all this happened in a SIX MONTH period.  In conclusion and trying to be non-technical, this TV set is pure trash. Apparently it burns itself to death due to a poor ventilation design. Right now is working, probably because I removed the rear cover and left the electronics exposed. A friend of mine who bought one too (because I recommended it at the beginning, I regret to say) throw it in the trash because it blew the screen too and he didn't had a service contract. It was 25 month old and he only used it for an average of 2 hours a day because he travels a lot.","Date":"July 4, 2006"}

Not only did it look huge but the picture was AWESOME...lots of inputs for anything you could possibly hook up (except no computer hook ups) almost completely idiot proof...unfortunately the manual stinks, it tells you the very basics but not nearly enough and it fails to mention what all the cables in the box are even for, thank goodness for philips 1800 number, customer service is easily accessible and very helpful and I didn't even have a hard time reaching a real person...the sound is doable but rumbles a little when playing loud sounds like roaring engines or explosions...is fully adjustable with slide bar features similar to an equalizer...and I don't know if you all are familiar with this type of feature or not but I have no clue if 1K should be raised or lowered?!? just go with the surround sound and then you won't have to worry about it...the picture looks a little warped on the automatic mode...which fills the screen for you completely...but I was at the store the other day and the more expensive models seem to do it to, so I think it's typical for this type of tv...if you're thinking about spending the money even if you're considering a top level model like a panasonic, this is definetely worth pausing at and considering...in the store...when this model is side by side with more expensive models you may tell a minute clarity difference, but sitting in your media room, family room, etc...the difference won't even be noticeable and the quality is definetely better than average...plus you'll save close to a thousand dollars with this model...go ahead buy it, you can always return it, and it won't even be that much of a hassle since this 42\" tv weighs less than the flat screen 27\" in my son's room, plus you can hang it on the wall!! how cool is that?!?!

Picture looks great, sound is just 'ok' (I knew that before purchasing), and delivery was on time.  *Note the lack of retailer warranty*.  I was also aware of this, but thought I'd take the chance anyway.  When I set the TV up, I noticed a section of the screen, 1\" wide, running from top to bottom that had green lines through it.  This is covered by the manufacturer's warranty, but I have to wait for repair/replacement.  Philip's local 'expert' had never heard of this problem before, and once my part arrives (about 6 weeks after I requested it), he will attempt to fix.  Apparently there is a LONG wait for all repair or replacement through Philips.I should note that if my tv had arrived in perfect condition, I would have rated 5/5 stars.  Completely satisfied with product, but still waiting for warranty.*Edit* 7 weeks after original arrival of TV, screen has been fixed.

{"Title":"a good buy for the price","Author":"Arthur P. Haviland Jr. \"AirshowFan\"","ReviewID":"RL9N4SV1DWZML","Overall":"good","Content":"Just in time for the Super Bowl (can we say that here?), I picked up this set at BJs for $1898. I took it home and hooked it up to a STB. No picture. After an hour of fooling with the cables and the remotes, I got it working. I should have tried the CableCard, it would have probably been easier. I did not purchase an expensive HDMI cable, but used the five standard cables that were supplied free by Cablevision (3 video and two audio leads).Once the set was on, WOW! The HD picture is fantastic. I watched the NJ Nets beat the Pistons at the Meadowlands on YES HD and you could see the grain in the wood floor. The detail is that amazing. Colors are crisp and bright. Regular signals that were \"stretched\" by my STB looked good. Text could be read clearly across the screen. HD channels look absolutely spectacular. The speakers are OK, but you will probably want to mate a nice surround sound system with a great tv like this.While LCD sets are getting better, you still can't beat plasma for brightness and viewing angles. I have my screen setup in a large room and the picture looks fine from all angles. The free desktop stand is a nice feature and it was easy to mount the set with two people. While some people feel that plasma sets will not last, the average screen is rated for 25,000 hours. Do a little match and you will see that should last you a dozen years or more. For commercial purposes, like message screens in airports and public buildings, plasma displays and used almost exclusively. That convinced me. One look at the picture on this screen, and you will be convinced as well.update 08/09/08This set is still working fine and has migrated from my living room to the master bedroom. Not needing a second HD set top box, I asked Brighthouse to install a CableCARD. It took a little work, but the card is working fine and saving me $4 a month over the STB rental. The CableCARD does not permit purchase of movies or ppv. That's OK with me.update 09/20/12Four years later and this set is still working great. I have a CableCard from Brighthouse that works on almost all the channels that I subscribe to.","Date":"February 1, 2006"}

Looked at all reviews we could find on the internet, went to the store a few times to look at tv's... and it looked great in the store.  Got it home, and its give and take.  From far away, it looks AWESOME.  but if you're any closer than 3 feet, it looks really pixelated.  we were watching a dvd... fast action, it looked TERRIBLE up close, and kinda fuzzy from a good distance.  It looks like theres a shadow on all letters on this tv.  And when we tried to hook up HDTV it looks AWFUL (but for now we're hoping thats just the cable box, not the tv).  But things are quickly looking worse.  We bought this last night to watch the Rose Bowl.... wasnt superb, but better than our puny tv.  But we're real back and forth on if we're gonna keep it, or look into a CRT HDTV... bigger and bulkier, so we arent too sure yet.The audio is AWESOME however.  and as per the manual, they have an extended one on CD-ROM.. much cheaper than a huge book, I'm sure.  Havent looked yet to see how in-depth the cd is.  The tv was very easy to install, and for its size, is very lightweight.  we're just nervous about the grainy look.  some advice... if you buy this in a store to take it home, this has to stand up, it cant lay down.  which the guy at sears mentioned it after we laid it down... hoping that those few minutes didnt screw it up.  So be prepared to have the space to keep it upright if you buy it in person.  And Sams Club has it for a great price.  $1897, cheapest I've seen so far.","Date":"January 5, 2006"}

Paid $1800 on Black Friday in 2005 from Circuit City. The picture is dazzling and the sound is good enough. HD sports programming and CSI Miami look fabulous. It is not used for home theater or DVD, we have another front projection system for that use; only Comcast cablecard and HDTV box. The cablecard sucks, slow, dropped channels, no menu, so the cable box works fine.  We do use a large APS battery backup as the DTE power sometimes has its quirks.

I got the TV for $1800 which was a deal in my mind for a plasma. I so far really have had no problems with the TV. Below are some things that I want to mention to let others know about this TV.Good:1. Picture is great. HDTV is awesome and DVD's look better on here than any other TV I have at home.2. Easy setup and the remote is pretty dummy proof. It's not the most advanced remote but it does it's job.3. Decent price. Although Plasma and other Widescreen TVs are going down in price, this tv still is relatively cheap compared to others.Bad:1. The speakers are not that great. I have a A/V receiver that takes care of the sound, but for the first month I used the OEM speakers on the TV and they were not that impressive.2. I have noticed now that playing video games or movies that are not true 16:9 ratio and have black bars will leave a ghost image after viewing for a couple hours. It isn't burn in, just ghost images. If you watch the tv regularly for another hour it goes away. I have no burn in.Notice that the settings are all set to the highest when you get the TV. Turn the contrast down, and try not to watch channels with static tickers or logos for the first 200hrs. This will help to decrease the risk of burn in or ghosting. Once I turned my contrast down my ghosting significantly went down.All in all this is a decent TV. I would reccomend it to my friends.**Update** I have had this tv for a year and a half now and still no problems. I upgraded the firmware to the latest version using a usb flash drive and any intermittent black screening went away. I have Component and HDMI sources going into the TV with no problem. The HDMI is more stable that alot of people would assume. I use a HTPC (Home Theater PC) and have no EDID or Sync problems at all. I feel I totally have gotten my money worth.

It was a display model, and I got such a deal I couldn't pass it up.  Anyway, after tweaking the thing for all it was worth and watching a few hours of HDTV, I've come to the realization that this is an exceptional TV.The good:* - Picture quality is great.  skin looks like skin and I end up watching stuff I'd never usually watch, just because it's on in high definition.* - TV isn't too heavy.  At 42\" and just under 100 lbs, I managed to get it all set up by myself.* - Built in tuners, pic in pic, and plenty of inputs to hook up all your goodies.* - Did I mention how good the picture quality was?The Bad* - The speakers.  They sound bad, and if you don't use them (like I don't) they aren't removable.  That's about 8 inches of horizontal space on my wall I'd like back, please.Also, as an aside, be careful about these recent reviews.  I actually bought a new one locally, but at this point the majority of these TVs are being bought refurbed directly from philips.

A bunch of lines appeared across the picture, and some research says they are probably due to a failed XY-scan board or similar. I replaced it with a Samsung PN50A50 at ~$1500 (nice TV - so far!), and have finally gotten round to putting it in a local shop - initial estimate for repair is $300~$500, which I guess might be JUST worthwhile. The guy at the shop says he has worked on several of these. At first they weren't worth repairing, because Philips deliberately asked outrageous prices for spares, but prices have come down since Philips got pressured (sued?) by the State of California because so many were ending up in landfills!My man says that pretty much everything other than Sony is being made in China with poor quality control, and will die sooner or later. The problem with most professional reviews, and even honest customer reviews from people like me, is that they tell you how good the new TV is, NOT how well it lasts. Plasmas run very hot, and if the components are not the very best, they will eventually fail.Glad I didn't pay the Philips extended warranty - it would have cost me about $900 for the extra 2 years. Even if I had had it, their reputation for service is so poor, I think I would have regretted it!I don't think I can change the stars with this edit - I would shift from 4 down to 2 if I could. Not a total lemon, but bad enough that Philips should be ashamed....++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Just been looking over other reviews for this TV, so I have some input of my own.We bought this for $1799 from Circuit City in the Black Friday sale the day after Thanksgiving 2005. It's still working, so they can't all be lemons.(1) The HD picture is still fantastic - when I am watching HD on this TV, everything is as perfect as can be.(2) Very occasionally, the picture on start-up looks like it is lacking one of the RGB Component lines, but it always clears up with a power cycle. I might have a slightly loose cable, for all I know.(3) Personally, I thought the built-in speaker quality was pretty poor (but I always use my home theater tuner).(4) I was checking out reviews here because Philips have just invited me to sign up for extended warranty at $449 a year for up to 3 years. Reading reviews of their service, I think I'll give it a pass. Even if they were as good as they claim to be, the risk to reward ratio isn't that great. In my (unqualified) experience, any electronics that gets through its first year burn in should be good for a while. And anyway, even if it goes belly up, I can probably replace it for not much more than the cost of 3 years' warranty extension.","Date":"September 27, 2006"}

Panasonic has plasma down. You must pay thousands more to get a better picture. This is the bottom line at this time. Perhaps things may change in time, but not quite yet. I am not affiliated with Panasonic and am merely summarizing my extensive and thorough research into plasma and lcd televisions.Now, as to the question of lcd versus plasma, it is also a given at this time that plasma offers a superior picture which must be the primary concern of a videophile.

I considered lcd tv's long and hard, and really wanted to believe in lcd technology, but in the end concluded the larger screen lcd tv's are drastically overpriced while offering poor performance. Perhaps technology will change this scenario one day, but I doubt it.Now, if you accept my position that Panasonic plasma is the way to go for high def, the next question is, which Panasonic plasma to choose?Mainly it depends on how much you wish to spend. The more money, the higher definition and the bigger screen you can afford. I found that the best price/performance ratio was to be had with this humble EDTV model. I do not wish to sign up for HDTV at this time due to the higher cable costs, so my motive in buying a higher def TV is mainly for watching DVD movies in their native resolution. I can personally attest that this EDTV is excellent (and is rated excellent by Consumer Reports) for DVD movies of all stripes.Prior to purchasing, I researched the th-42pwd8uk so much online that I knew its name by heart. Daily I entered this name in Google to read reviews, and observed that it was widely acclaimed for an excellent picture at a reasonable price. At its current price, there is only one serious competitor to the th-42pwduk, and it is the retail version of the Panasonic 42\", which has a silver case rather than a black one. The other brand names, Sony, Samsung, Phillips et al, have not at this time received comparable ratings for those units in the same price range (below $3000). A consensus has emerged placing the crown of achievement upon Panasonic's head.This is the professional version of the 42\" Panasonic plasma EDTV; not to be confused with the higher-resolution, and correspondingly higher price HDTV. Also, not to be confused with the ugly silver version of the 42\" EDTV being sold at the retail chains. Panasonic has a wide array of models and it gets quickly confusing sorting them all out. I studied them all and settled on this one being the best for my purpose (combined PC / TV use).The most important difference to keep in mind is that, unlike the retail version, the th-42pwd8uk boasts a VGA connection and is readily connected to any PC, a point many reviewers have sadly overlooked, bedazzled as they are by its amazing TV picture. It also has what many consider to be a more attractive appearance with its neutral black case that does not detract from the decor of a sophisticated home. The price is slightly lower than the silver version, though if you buy the Panasonic stand (TY-ST08K) you pay an extra $200 (including shipping). With the stand, the prices become about the same.The advantages of the silver-colored retail version of the 42\" Panasonic plasma EDTV are that it can be obtained locally at the big chain stores, and already has everything you need built in: speakers, tuner, and stand. I submit, however, that the speakers are of limited value since most people paying big bucks for higher def will connect their sound to an existing surround-sound system. I also find the tuner of limited value to folks who are not subscribed to high-def. The stand is just ugly. And then you calculate the not-inconsiderable addition of sales tax.What decided the issue for me is that th-42pwd8uk has a VGA connection and simply looks more attractive. I really did not want the silver retail monstrosity in my living room. The stand feet make it look like a robot from a bad 1950s sci-fi movie.Naturally, you should be nervous buying this unit online--which is why I did my research--but if you buy from a highly reputable dealer, I think you may be very pleased, as I was. I watched \"Lord of the Rings\" on this monitor and the picture was simply outstanding. If you play many DVD movies, this is definitely the choice for you.Recommendations:-if you intend to set the unit on a table, rather than mounting on the wall, buy the TY-ST08K. It is a heavy metal method of securing your plasma TV and keeping it from falling down. I own and recommend it. I want to be very clear that this unit does not come equipped with any kind of stand or feet and *cannot* remain vertical on its own! I had to prop the unit up against a wall for eight days, waiting for the stand to arrive. Decide prior to purchase whether to wall-mount or use a stand. One of the things that really tick me off about certain retailers is they often picture it as having the stand, when it DOES NOT include any such thing!-You will need female-RCA-to-male-BNC adaptors to connect your RCA cables for the component and composite connections. You definitely should connect your DVD player via the component connection. S-video is a less desirable alternative. Composite is the worst choice and should only be used as a last resort.-Now comes the favorite part of my review, the VGA connection. According to the manual, you can achieve 852 x 480 resolution on your PC. Going any further risks loss of clarity. I went further, to 800 x 600, and sacrificed some clarity, but don't really mind. The connection to the computer is effortless and plug-n-play. Don't worry, your PC will connect just fine to this television. The only thing you will need to do is go to Control Panel | Display and adjust your resolution to fit this monitor. I do not recommend using 1024 x 768 on this EDTV model. Perhaps on its HDTV cousin, but that's another story.-I used to recommend buying high-priced, high quality component cables. But since then, I have discovered that you can get a good picture from lower priced, less fancy cables. I have a feeling the \"Monster\" brand may be a good bit overpriced. I bought 6' Monster component cables, gold-plated, for about $65 from Radio Shack. I connected using gold-plated female-RCA-to-male-BNC adaptors. Remember, this unit requires such adaptors--but they are cheap and easily obtained online, at Ebay for instance, or locally at Radio Shack. But when I bought a Panasonic DVD player, the Monster cables would not fit in its component hookups. So I wound up using the cheap-looking cables Panasonic provided with the DVD player. It doesn't seem to be a big difference.-try to avoid using the composite video connection. If you are staying with SDTV, like me, try to go with S-video if at all possible. The lack of an HDMI input, unless you have special requirements, is irrelevant; component cables provide quite comparable reception as that newer, \"copy-protected\" option, which was devised by and is being promoted by the movie industry. Do the research; component input is all you need. It is being phased out of newer models--unfortunately.-read the manual and take the time to learn the many features of your intelligent monitor. In particular, learn how to switch between the viewing modes.-I think you should turn the brightness down from day 1 when you receive your monitor. I have this theory they jack the brightness UP as a factory default just so it will look good on a showroom floor and make a good first impression. But the television's longevity matters to me; and I didn't really need the ultra-high brightness.-another recommendation is to turn the screen saver function ON, just as a precaution, to help avoid burn-in.-on your DVD player, make sure to change the output signal to \"Widescreen\" (i.e. 16:9) and \"Progressive scan\" either 525p or 480p. This, combined with a component cable connection, will get you an excellent picture.  If your DVD player doesn't support these options, buy a new DVD player! It's well-worth it. If you're strapped for cash, a new progressive scan player from Samsung only runs about $60 - $70 or so.-Lastly, let me reiterate that this is a monitor, and has no tuner. To get television reception, you must hook your coaxial cable to a vcr, cable box, or dvd player that does have a tuner. I was doing this anyway for my previous tv, so it was not a big deal to me.","Date":"January 10, 2006"}

It's a big move up from our 27\" tube.  We have a basic set up... Tivo hooked up via s-video and a progressive scan DVD via component video.  This product is a display only.  It doesn't have a built in tv tuner and so we use our Tivo for that.  The picture quality of the Tivo on this display is marginal, but still better than what we used to have... and from 12'-15' back, you probably won't notice the difference from an HD display.  The DVD output, on the other hand, is excellent.  The detail, color, and realism is amazing.  Save yourself up to $1000 and go with the EDTV... I think it's just as good as HD for most people.","Date":"December 14, 2005"}

{"Title":"Picture so good you'll forget about HD","Author":"Joshua G. Feldman \"Technophile\"","ReviewID":"R39XRWB81ANUR5","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the TH-42PWD8UK after exhaustive research and dozens of showroom screenings.  To be blunt, these Panasonics have (both the HDs and EDs), by far, the best picture you can have in your home and I'm delirously happy with it.  There are a bunch of caveats and issues, though.  The flat screen TV decision cuts across a mess of issues:1) Plasma versus LCD.  LCDs look better in the average showroom because they have smaller pixels (finer grained picture) and brighter backlighting.  Plasma's hidden strength is their rich blacks and more vivid colors.  In real life you sit back 8 feet or so from the screen - so the pixel size issue disappears.  The brightness issue disappears in real life too - where I, like most folks, do most of my viewing in evening or night hours in a partially lit room.  Plasma's strengths in dense blacks and vivid colors equates to a greater image dynamics - more akin to film than regular television.  Once you start to spot it, LCDs look a bit washed out by comparison.  Plasma's vividness can be a dual edge sword.  Sometimes flesh tones can look too pink.  Panasonic gets this right - better than most other plasma screens.  Rear projection and front projector units can't compete for vivid picture or image contrast (not to mention angle of view - the big drawback of rear projection BTW).2) HDTV versus EDTV.  HD has higher resolution - but only HD broadcasts can take advantage of it.  All the rest of the content you throw at it (DVDs, regular TV broadcasts) must be upsampled.  (EDTVs have to upsample regular broadcasts too BTW).  Resampling can introduce artifacts (blocky shapes).  The quality of resampled images varies quite a bit among different manufacturers and is the reason why you shouldn't necessarily go cheap.  EDTV is designed to have the same resolution as DVD - and DVDs look amazing on the 42PWD8UK.  HDTVs can actually look inferior to EDTVs on DVDs and regular broadcasts because of the upsampling issue.  HD content looks pretty darned good on the 42PWD8UK too - even though it must be downsampled.  I spent a good long time looking at an HD demo on the HD and ED models of this monitor and found the difference surprising subtle.  I haven't regretted the decision so far.  Obviously the only major reason to go with HD is that you have HD channels on cable or satellite, and plan to go to blue-ray or HD DVD soon.  If these moves are not immenent for you - then don't pay extra for HD.  By the time HD fully penetrates, prices will have dropped a lot and it will be close to time for a new TV anyway.3) Consumer versus Commercial line.  The 42PWD8UK is from Panasonic's commercial line.  That's why it is sold without a stand, speakers, and without a tuner  (and has such a low price).  Stand or wall mount is your choice - but you must budget to buy one or the other.  I found a Panasonic brand stand for $185 and it's great.  Most folks have external cable or satellite boxes so the internal tuner you buy with the consumer line model is wasted money.  The fact that HDMI interface is a cost added option is a non-issue with EDTV - since you will not benefit from the higher resolution of that interface.  The 42PWD8UK comes with three inputs standard: BNC coax digital composite, Component Video (the three R-G-B cables), and computer SVGA.  Trust me - Component Video is good enough.  The inclusion of SVGA is awesome too - for those who have a computer in their home entertainment system.  As for speakers - a big screen like this screams out for a good surround receiver and 5.1 (or 6.1 or 7.1) channel audio speakers.  If you don't invest the extra $500-$1000 that a decent 5.1-7.1 audio setup will run you you are really cheating yourself.  Immersive audio is hugely important in home theater and will really augment the great picture you'll get with the 42PWD8UK.  Given that you own your own home theater audio setup - or will be derelict if you don't get one - the issue of the 42PWD8UK not including speakers is irrelevent.4) Panasonic versus the other guys.  Short and sweet - there's no better picture at anywhere near the price.  At the high end only Hitachi and Pioneer compete.  Interesting offerings like HP end up just being rebranded Panasonics.  Cheaper units like Philips (much as I normally like their stuff) look too pink on flesh tones and have inferior black detail.  Don't get a cheaper HDTV just because it's HD!  The resolution difference is negligible compared to overall image quality.  Image quality is where the 42PWD8UK rules - and isn't that really the bottom line here?","Date":"June 12, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great Value - Best Buy - No brainer ;)","Author":"S. Shah \"desi101\"","ReviewID":"R3BV734BCSCIGQ","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an excellent plasma TV. I have it for little more than 6 months and I am happy that I bought this baby!I did research for about 8 months before I bought Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK. First thing, look @ at consumer reports or any website for reviews on Plasmas - on top 10 list more than 50% will be from Panasonic. This company knows how to dig plasmas. Second part is you need to decide about your needs - what exactly you are looking for. In my case, I wanted a plasma that's slim & slick. I ddin't want any speakers associated with the plasma for two reasons - the OEM speakers are NEVER decent quality & I didn't want huge looking thing on my wall. This plasma is basically industrial/commercial display - no speakers, no stands. And that was perfect for me as I can just hang it on the wall (I had to buy seperate wall mount).Another thing to keep in mind - this EDTV not HDTV. To be frank, I still can't understand the hype for HDTV. I don't have HDTV cable so for me it didn't matter. The quality I think equal to or better than HDTV (compared to HDTV plasmas what I had seen in retail stores).This TV doesn't have any stand or mount so you need to buy something on day 1 - otherwise you won't be able to put it anywhere. I bought the mount from CostCo and happy with that.For the connections - look @ the other review over here - there' all possible technical details on that one so I won't bore you with those.In the end, I will say this is a great plasma with awesome picture quality. If you are buying plasma, get yourself decent home theatre system too. Your A/V receiver can handle all the connections to your cable box, DVD, VCR, CD player etc. And finally, get yourself one of the fancy Logitech/harmony universal remote too. I got harmony 880 and love it. Tip - Plasma on wall, nice slick speakers with high output and 1 universal remote to manage everything will impress anyone anytime - including yourself!","Date":"October 12, 2006"}

{"Title":"Expect to add extras","Author":"RicK \"Rick\"","ReviewID":"R3P48FL4GQ5MLX","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an excellent plasma TV. However, as others indicated it doesnt come with an HDMI outlet although it can be purchased for extra, about 150 dollars. Also it doesnt include speakers, so expect to pay an extra 500 for a decent sorround sound system, it also doesnt include a stand, so expect to pay another 200 for a stand although whats the point of purchasing a plasma if your not going to mount it? It defeats the purpose! Also it DOES make a huge difference, having an elegant TV like this mounted makes your whole place look better. A mount costs around 250-350 dollars plus installation runs around 500-1000 dollars depending on the size and whether you want to mount speakers, hide wires, etc. So paying 1500 is only the beginning, expect to add at least another 1300 to this price. running your total roughly to around 3,000 for a 42'' non-hdtv plasma. One reviewer mentioned he was thankful for panasonic producing EDTV's for poorer people who can't afford HDTV. Let me just say that HDTV is available for under 1,000 with CRT widescreen's and under 1700 for DLP 50'' TV's. If you have this TV then you are most definately able to afford HDTV. IF you \"MUST\" have an HDTV (plasma) do some research and you will be able to pay an extra 400 for that privelage, don't be cheap! you deserve it, especially when HD DVD's are coming out and all programming will be in HD come the next 2-3 years, don't sell yourslves short!","Date":"March 20, 2006"}
{"Title":"Works extremely well with 1080i or 720p signals!","Author":"R. Chi","ReviewID":"R215P7FVAFUN17","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been pretty happy with the performance of the TH-42PWD8UK. I've had it for over a year now. Picture quality from DVD using component cable is very good, and has been what I am using it mostly for. I never feel the need for HD. DVDs looks awesome, as this unit is the native resolution of DVDs. I won't be far off to say that none of the HD sets in the store looks better than this one.But the reason I am writing this review is my surprise finding of how well it scales 1080i or 720p image when fed such signals. I recently got a Samsung HD tuner, and naturally I set the output to 480p, my TV's resolution. I also tried a Panasonic DVD recorder with HD-tuner, and the picture quality was about the same as the Samsung, very good.However, while tweaking some settings on the Samsung, I changed the output setting on the back of the unit to 720p and 1080i. I was expecting the TV not to display anything, but much to my surprise, a proper image is displayed. Even to my bigger surprise, the picture looks noticeably sharper and more detailed!! How can that be? The set is not HD! I pondered this for a while and came to the conclusion that the TV must have a much better scaling algorithm than the Samsung tuner.With HD tuner sending a 1080i signal, picture quality looks astounding! My friend was looking to buy a Panasonic 50\" plasma, and came by to take a look at my TV. Both he and his wife were stunned by the picture quality and how it looks better than all the HD units they've seen. Anyway, I am extremely happy with the performance of the scaling algorithm on the TV. If you have HD source, set it to 1080i output and enjoy! You will not be disappointed.One thing that still puzzles me a bit is why HD materials look sharper and more detailed than DVDs, and I am talking about good quality DVDs here. Since this set is the native resolution of DVD, theoretically it's as good as it will get. HD material should look the same as DVDs, since the end result of what you see, IS 480p.I wonder if I get an upconverting DVDs, and send the unit a 1080i signal, whether it will look better than the standard DVD. In theory it shouldn't, since scaling 480p to 1080i and scale back would not gain you much, but does it? I guess when my current DVD player dies I'll get a new one and find out.","Date":"October 30, 2007"}

Excellent versatility!","Author":"Farid Khan \"KHAAAAAAAAAAANN!!!\"","ReviewID":"R2T84VCVRRMRP5","Overall":"good","Content":"ABOUT WHERE I PURCHASED THE TV FROM:I bought this TV (technically a monitor) from Butterfly Photo.  Although they weren't the cheapest (still got a great price), it was an online store I've bought from in the past and I knew they had a physical location if I needed to get in there face about something.  Turned out to be one of my best shopping experiences which is very comforting for such a large purchase.  They called me the next night after I placed my order to let me know that the TV DOES NOT come with the component video (RGB) connections that is used to connect to my DVD player, cable box, and Xbox.  I thought he was just trying to get me to buy more stuff, but it checked out on Panasonic's website, so got me the component video terminal board for $100 off the cheapest site I could find.  Then they upgraded my warranty and shipping for free!  So, much to my surprise, I had the TV the next day.ABOUT THE TV:I should note that every part of my A/V system (TV, audio receiver, cable box, DVD, and Xbox) is connected and powered through Monster cabling and surge protector.  Since this TV does not have speakers, the only thing I can comment on is the picture...and it is OUTSTANDING!  I've had the TV for a couple of weeks now and used a Panasonic white paper ([...]) as a guide on \"breaking in\" the TV.  In general, how plasma TVs are used in the first 100 hours is critical for the longevity and picture quality, particularly their susceptibility to burn-in.  A lot of retailers say that if you are going to play console games, you should get anything other than a plasma.  This is generally wrong for current generation plasmas, and especially wrong for this TV, Panasonic TH-50PHD8UK 50\" Plasma HDTV, because it has a number of options (e.g. wobbling and screen savers) that can be activated to reduce the already low chance of burn-in to a negligible chance.The space scenes in the Fifth Element looked incredible because the empty space was inky yet the stars still shone clearly and distinctly.  Jet Li's Hero was fantastic!  The color themes in the movie really demonstrated the exceptional color saturation and depth that the TV is capable of, especially the lake scene!  There is no lag or blurring during fast action scenes in movies or on the Xbox.My only complaint is that there are not enough HD channels.  This TV does do a far better job of displaying non-HD (4:3) content without pixelating than other HDTVs I've seen.If you're looking for something wrong with the TV, then you won't find it having to do with anything with the picture quality.  It does not come with speakers, so you'll need the optional speakers or an external home theater system.  It does not have a TV tuner, so you'll need a cable box or the optional terminal board.  It does not come with the consumer component connections (RGB), and I did have to buy that.BOTTOM LINE:I honestly would rather watch movies with this TV (plus my sweet sound system) than going to a theater.  It's that good.","Date":"April 6, 2006"}
{"Title":"The best plasma for the money","Author":"G. Clayton","ReviewID":"R3K64ZO3MN3GVY","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had experience with several HDTVs and this one is the best especially at this price. This is actually a commercial model TV which is a good thing. You don't have to pay for extra speakers and a tuner you won't use and its a generation ahead of consumer models in display tech.Forget having to tweak the settings all day using a setup DVD to get the best picture, this thing looked amazing out of the box. I barely had to change anything to get a perfect picture. My old Sony HDTV required hours of tweaking to get anywhere near the image quality.I've never seen a better picture than this TV displaying from an HD-DVD. Its simply like you are looking through a window.In regards to the person saying you have to buy an add-on board for 'consumer' component inputs, he is wrong. This TV comes with the component input board and you just have to buy BNC->RCA adaptors to connect up to it. Whoever made him buy a consumer component input board just robbed him of 120 bucks when he could of just bought the BNC adaptors for 5 bucks.However you DO have to buy an HDMI input board if you want HDMI. It is recommended with this set because of this (from Panasonics info page): \"Up to 2,048 shades of gradation (4,096 shades via HDMI or DVI connection)\". I'm not sure why that is.","Date":"August 11, 2006"}

I've enjoyed my 508UK going on 5 years with no problems, nothing to complain about... period.  Friends invite me over to see there new flat panels and to date, I have yet to see anything that is a better viewing experience.  When I asked Panasonic if they were going to come up with a 1080P driver, they of course, fed me a line of pablum.  If you are interested and have enough spare change, check out the new (07'?)TY-FB9HD driver, I think you will find for $1,200 you can have a 1080P monitor.  But... I'll have to see it first to believe the picture can be much better or worth $1,200 than what's standard viewing on the 8UK.  A friend volunteer to come by and plug his set-up equipment (when I brought mine home) and calibrate it, but after looking at it, smiled and had a drink instead.  Next thing, I go over for a visit and guess what hanging on his wall?  For the money, if you can locate a 8UK, I suggest you pony up and get one.

I am in teh Motion Picture Academy (the \"Oscars\" folks) and so I get movies from the studios to watch before I vote.  This means I need what I call a \"critical viewing\" setup at home.  When the time came two years ago for us to go big and flat at home, the coice of a screen was a no-brainer.  Not only did our Vid Techs choose this after extensive research, but Consumer Reports chose it as the top pic for three years now.  It is great.  I do suggest you tape over the Panasonic logo with black tape to reduce visual distraction.Here's the BEST thing about this screen.  It is a MONITOR, meaning it has no video tuner or audion amplifier.  Most folks feed their TV from a cable or satellite box, so a tuner is unneccessary.  They also often use a home theater audio amp, so the speakers and audio amp in most plasmas (and other types of screens) is a waste.  That means you will eb spending around $1.000 for stuff YOU WILL NEVER USE!  Get a MONITOR, not a television.  Besides the already mentioned quality, and ruggedness, you will save enough to upgrade the rest of the system...  While you're at it, check out the OPPO brand DVD players.

The only flaw in this T.V. are the black levels. They are definately not plasma quality.

This Olevia TV is a great deal. It is bright, has great connection features and the picture when hooked up to a hdtv source (be it DirecTV or DVD) looks fantastic. When you put it side by side to any Sony or Sharp for that size, it is very hard to justify paying an extra $1000 to get those. This TV is pretty awesome. The response time is perfect at 8 ms, so while watching football or hockey there are no motion artifacts. The only slight drawback is its remote is rather clunky, but not bad and not enough that it would lower my score.

I've had it running now for over a week and it works as advertised - and that's what i'm looking for in any product. I haven't found any feature or function that is not what they claim it to be. Yes some of the common brand names have a more slick case and nicer remote but none of them had anything compelling enough for me to spend upwards of $3000.00. Overall this Olevia tv is a quantum leap for me personally as I was using a 9 year old RCA 36 inch monster that had seen it's better days. The big guys better watch out - if Syntax keeps delivering better product at half the price of the competition, they could really grab some market share. Bottom line - if you want to get into a high def LCD tv thats of a reasonable size but can't drop 3 grand - give this one a try.","Date":"October 19, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good TV","Author":"Yi Feng","ReviewID":"R3429XGHZX86B1","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this TV for 2 weeks. Overall I like it.1. It is a HDTV. Amazon says HD-Ready which is not accurate. It has a build-in ASTC which works fine with a HD atenna I loaned from someone.2. I still subscribed from Comcast a HDTV box. Using its component outputs, 11 HD channels look awesome. The bad thing is once you get used to these 11 channels, those old analog ones become horrible to view. Comcast NTSC tunner seems worse than this TV's own NTSC tunner. When I hook the cabel directly to the TV's atenna-in, the pictures indeed look better than those from the camcast box. However, Camcast encrypted all HD channels to force you use their box.3. I then bought a Philips 5900/37 DVIX/DVD player with HDMI output. The player is capable to do 720p and 1080i up-conversion. Suprisingly, the upconversion looks great. I can see no blocks. I threw in two HD-DVIX movies. They play back on the TV with fantastic pictures. I love HDMI. Once cable for both crystal clear video and audio.4. The only drawback is its VGA input. I do think it is bit too fuzzy for a computer monitor. And it doesn't sync very well with 1280x1024@60. I tried a computer game \"Call of Duty\". It looks good but not great. They should've provided both DVI and HDMI.Overall, I think the TV serves the mission really well. I highly recommend it.I bought it directly from Target. $1415 including Tax. and shipping. No complains for the price.","Date":"December 16, 2005"}

The real surprise came when I purchased an HD antenna at Radio Shack for under $50.  I live about 35 miles south of Los Angeles.  After going to Antennaweb.org to dial in my antenna placement I was all set up.  I can pick up over 50 DIGITAL channels with the antenna, about 18 of those are in either 720P or 1080i. I can get more HD channels with the antenna than the cable company offers for $$$...and no cable box required. The clarity in HD is unbelievable. Sports and PBS nature shows are awesome to watch. It looks like you are looking through a window rather than a TV screen.  The HD picture is crisp and clear and the colors are bright and very vivid, the sound is very good also.  My only complaint is that there is only 1 HDMI interface.  Would need 2 if I wanted to have a HD cable or sat box and upconvert DVD player. The remote is pretty dorky looking also, but who cares.  Some reviewers have complained of a hissing sound coming from the speakers, I have not noticed it in mine.

I encourage all those in my situation to contact their customer service email.Okay, the TV. I was going for a Sharp Aquos 37\", but decided to save about $1500 and get the Syntax Olevia instead.CONS: It seems a bit bulkier and more computer flat-panel in design than living room chic (I love the glass frame look of the Samsungs). I would have liked detached speakers. When audio is muted or off, you can hear some residual noise. I would have liked pure silence.PROS: The display is bright, good contrast, and the built-in tuner is nice. I use it currently for DVDs, so I can't really test HD resolutions yet. I use an Oppo Digital DVD player with HDMI outputs. My wife loves the new TV and enjoys watching shows on it.Overall, I think there's good value for the money spent.

My sights were on Panasonic plasma panel TH-PHD8UK. In the stores I could check only the older model LT37HV - and it was OK but nothing special. However financial realities - almost $2K for a good 42\" Panasonic Plasma, plus the stand, plus time & efforts & getting-help (and expense!!) to install the plasma panel, plus the greater delicacy of the plasma compared to LCD - compelled me to abandon my expensive tastes and go for this LCD TV.This TV was at the low margin wrt. screen size and capabilities - I didn't consider anything smaller than 37\". Also, this is my first Hi-Def TV, but I've experience with normal LCD TVs (used 20\" for video editing) and LCD displays (21\" is my main computer display, 1600x1200).First impressions - this Olevia TV is great! Its functionality is pretty basic, but the quality (so far :-) is wonderful. Both HDTV and DVD displays were breathtaking. SD and digital channels were also quite fine (with some exceptions, which are not TV's faults in my educated opinion). Number of possible connections is quite sufficient for most applications. HDMI is included, and it offered me the best picture quality. Component (2 inputs) works great. I haven't even bothered with composite and S-Video (2 each). Built-in speakers are OK, but I mostly use it with my audio system.  My viewing distance was between 5 and 12 feet - I was happy with the screen size & picture. I tried over-the-air HDTV - and it worked fine.PROS:- Great price.- Great video quality.- Nice calm non-intruding finish.- HDMI and plenty of other connections.- Built-in speakers for those who need them.- Decent capabilities (picture size, DTV reception, etc. etc).- Not so \"touchy\" with transportation, installation, usage (LCD is  more resilient than, say plasma).CONS:- Doesn't have Zoom picture mode (only 4:3, 16:9, Panoramic and Full).- Speakers are not detachable (not a big deal, just takes unnecessary space).OVERALL: I am very happy with this 37\" LCD TV.

It refuses to work at almost all but direct angles.- Dropping LCD prices ensure the price you pay will be more than if you waitNote that I've bought expensive electronics and I can tell you, the expensive electronics fail just like the cheap ones.

Wang \"Gadget Guy\"","ReviewID":"RWOUEYGLETAVQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a review on this tv before on amazon, I gave it 5 stars back then base on price/quality, and guess what?! I am still a very happy Olevia tv owner! TV works great, maybe I am just one of the luckier owner of this tv. Some reviews mentioned TV doesn't work because of LCD. COME ON! If you would have done some research, you would have know all the tv manafactur buys LCD from LG/Philips and put their brand name on it with their own sauce in it. If you have to replace LCD for $500 when this tv's lcd breaks down after 18 months, don't you think the same lcd goes on a Sony/Panasonic set would work longer than 18 months? Have you read reviews on more expensive brand name LCD HDTV? You will see alot of out of warranty problems too. I can't say much about Syntax's customer support service, so I can rate their service quality but base on all the reviews I read in here, I will stay skeptical. Of course I won't be able to rate them either since my TV is already out of warranty. I do recommend you to get a Harmony remote. I love it when I get to use only 1 remote and press 1 activity button, Harmony remote will turn on my TV, change TV source if necessary, turn on my Onkyo receiver and change input source accordingly, turn on my DirecTV satelite receiver. I even have my Harmony remote to turn on my IR light switch. You can do the same for watching DVD, playing XBOX, PC, and etc.","Date":"December 13, 2005"}
{"Title":"Good Screen, Sketchy Video HW","Author":"A. Miller","ReviewID":"R31KCPXKMRCZP2","Overall":"good","Content":"Having never seen a truly objective review of the screen, I thought I'd add my review.  I own a 37HVE which only lacks the ATSC hi-def tuner from the 37HVS.  If you don't need 480 progressive (see below), or good vga support, then it's a very good television set at a fantastic price.Pros480i/720p/1080i look great on television.Speakers produce good sound.Lots of inputs.Heavy and big and wide with attached speakers.  Black bezel is nicely hides wall.  Really focuses your attention on the screen.Cons1) 480 progressive mode is broken (which Xbox 360 defaults to for dvd playback).  Looks like the video circuitry doesn't align the scanline fields properly so I a variable 100 pixel shift.  This shift converges and then separates, making the screen unreadable.  This happens for my PS2 and Xbox with component cables.  Had to run in 480i mode on those units, but I don't have 480i option for dvd playback on the 360.2) Sketchy warranty support.  Warranty states that you may only get in-house service if you register within 30 days of product purchase.  See 3).3) Even if you do write in for warranty support, or call them and get a code, they have not yet returned replies.4) Amazon freight company took away the box without even asking, making it impossible to redeem the rebate (or return the product).  Amazon policy is to only take returns before 30 days, so now that I found out about the 480p, I am basically stuck with hoping for warranty support.5) No real color adjustment.  Defaults seem to be the only usable settings.6) VGA connection never synches to a 16:9 1360x760 signal.  Best I could achieve was a 1024x768 stretched image.  This means photos, movies look stretched when displayed.  Other resolutions were either letterboxed, or stretched badly.  I have not tried DVI inputs.","Date":"December 4, 2005"}

I ordered the 37\" from Amazon and have been extremly happy since its arrival. The picture quality is nothing short of amazing - get the HDMI cable connection for your Digital HD Cable or satellite box as it is SO much clearer than using the Component connectors. I also use the TV for playing XBOX 360, and the quality is simply stunning. For this price, you cannot touch good quality 32\" LCD, let alone a 37\".

The black-levels (black colored contrast) leave quite a bit to be desired, but the reduced amount of screen lighting glare compared to most technologies is good. When the camera is panning across a scene the image seems to jutter, it may have something to do with the response time. Also, the remote needs to be replaced.One time it would not change channels, so I wrote the company by e-mail and they did not respond. I unplugged the TV and plugged it back in and it fixed the problem. Digital Channels take a while to change so instread of just flipping channels, I enter the number in. Otherwise, I am pretty impressed for the money. You probably cannot beat it.","Date":"January 18, 2006"}
{"Title":"Happy after 4 years...","Author":"Lauren","ReviewID":"R1ZXNJJFVJ474P","Overall":"good","Content":"I thought I would leave a review for this TV I bought in 2004. I use my TV constantly being a gamer usually around 4-6 hours a day every day, this TV has easily taken excessive use frequently leaving games on overnight. I have not had one single problem and when I bought it there were only good reviews on it even though there weren't very many. Now it seems everyone has these problems so for a while I have been expected my TV to go but behold she holds crisp and bright as ever. Even when compared to more modern pictures and features today I think this TV was one of the best buys I ever made. Not one dead pixel or weird noises, just a perfect picture every time. The only drawbacks are the speakers are a bit below average but sounds to me always suck on an LCD HDTV, the manufactures figure if you have 1k+ form a nice HD TV, what's a couple hundred more for some decent surround sound? The remote sucks horribly, the TV is also slow to react to the remote, the other negative is there is a blue light on the front, real bright, stays on constantly. But the negatives to me are what I would want to be negatives in a TV. The 'core' of the tv (pixels, features like hdmi, functionality etc.) are all there. I only paid about $1000 including shipping and taxes so my positive review might be a bit biased for those who paid more. But I absolutely LOVE my tv, and for a grand 4-5 years ago it has easily been worth every cent.","Date":"October 4, 2009"}

You have to be at least 3' away from the TV before the remote will work.  But I've since programmed my DirecTV remote to work the volume, channels, and power on my TV.  The HD picture quality is excellent for this TV.  I'm using a DirecTV HD DVR outputting to HDMI.  The regular digital channels look good as well.  I've been using the \"Panoramic\" viewing mode for watching regular 4:3 channels, and that mode greatly reduces the \"stretching\" that normally occurs.  Most of the channels I watch are regular digital channels anyway, so that was a high priority for me.  I think 37\" is a good size.  I was going to get the 42\", but that seemed too big for my room.  Make sure you register your TV either online or with the mail-in card to get the 1 year onsite warranty.  I'm glad I purchased this TV and I have no regrets yet.  I couldn't stomach paying $2,000 for a name-brand.  While I'm not a true videophile, I do appreciate a good quality picture, and great value.","Date":"August 28, 2006"}

Great picture quality, even DirecTV looked pretty good, and thats coming from an s-video signal.  DVD's and xbox 360 look excellent.  HDMI, 2 components, 2 s-video, audio out, VGA, its all there.I was initially concerned about the sound with these being a budget set, but the sound is fine.  good clear sound coming from 2 20 watt speakers.  it also gives you the audio out jack which is nice.  theres plenty of sound adjustments as well.Menus were nice and easy.  A little slow to respond from the remote but easy to use and well designed.The remote is the weak link on this TV.  Its not horrible, its just not that good.  It gets the job done, but is very slow to react and it seems the line of sight is very narrow.  you find yourself wondering if the batteries are dead and then all of the sudden it responds.Havent tried the over the air HD yet.  I'll edit my review once I do.  All in all, a very good buy.  I cant see spending over 2 grand plus tax on a Sharp, Sony or Samsung.

The blacks are BLACK\", the colors are vibrant and the flesh is natural.  Further, the justification of fullscreen programming looks great -- it is not distracting at all.The controls are very simple, but infinintely tweak-ableThe television is also expandable -- with card slots to allow for almost any type of input.  It comes standard with component, s-video, composite, and computer input.  (If you want hdmi or dvi, you have to purchase a separate card, and install it in the extra expansion bay).since it is a commercial monitor, it does not have a built in turner or speakers (though you can add those).  I saw this as a plus -- why pay for built in speakers, when I planned to run the TV through my home theater anyway? As for the tuner -- it is not that big of a deal to just use a cable box.The television is very simple -- a black frame with NO buttons on front.  Nothing to distract you from the picture.In addition, since it is fanless, it is nearly silent.","Date":"January 31, 2006"}

Other reviewers have commented on the product itself and one should read the reviews at cnet.com as well.I mostly wanted to comment on the shipping process as I was initially hesitant to order such a large, expensive item via the internet.  I was eligible for and selected the free Super Saver Shipping.  The shipping was done by a company called Eagle Global Logistics (EGL) and was very efficient.  About a week after placing the order I was contacted by EGL by phone and they offered me a choice of days for delivery.  The delivery came on the agreed day within their stated four-hour window.  It ended up arriving seven days sooner than the estimated delivery date.The plasma screen itself comes securely suspended in styrofoam and a cardboard box, which itself is suspended in styrofoam and a cardboard box--all of it original Panasonic packaging.  The EGL deliverer brought it to the door with a dolly, and he and I carried it inside.  It couldn't have been a smoother process.I chose to get the older stand (Panasonic TY-ST07-K) as I prefer its look to that of the 08.  I had a hard time finding this model but was able to get it from a site called ProjectorMounts.ca and had it shipped from Canada at a resonable price.  (I also experienced good service from them.)

Navigating the menus is sometimes a bit of a problem, as they're not set up as intuitively as a lot of TVs I've owned.My only real complaint would be the initial set up of the TV. I pulled it out of it's box, and only then did I realize (my fault probably) that it doesn't come with a stand. Because of that, and because no store near me carried the stand designed to work with that TV I had to get a wall mount. So the TVs price is TV + Stand. And depending on what you want to use the TV for you'll have to get adapters. I went to plug in my R/G/B cables from my X-Box 360 and they wouldn't fit. The R/G/B cables on the TV were for BCN or something like that. So I had to go and buy the adapters for that. Five of them to get full usage of the TVs ports. So price is now TV + Stand + 5 RCA-BCN converters. And theres no place on the TV (that I could find) to plug in regular cable television. I have no idea what kind of converter I'm going to get for that, but I'm sure theres one out there.If none of that bothers you though, then get the TV.

After seeing several of the new plasma TV's at the local electronic stores I decided that was the route for me.  After doing weeks worth of research I was set to go with the Panasonic 42px500u.  The unit had all of the specs that I wanted: 42\", cablecard, TV Guide, VGA input, PIP and media card slots. Then I read about the new Toshiba Plasmas that were coming out in August/September.  The Toshiba 42hp95 pretty much had the same specs as the Panasonic except for the name.I went to a local electronics store that had the TV and watched it side by side with the Panasonic 42px50u.  Both had clear black levels and an unbelievable picture.  Not finding the 500u in a retail store, I went with the Toshiba.  I have not regretted it at all.First what you should expect: bright clear picture.  HD of course looks incredible.  I do have digial cable and the digital channels look extremely well but surprisingly the SD channels look great! Setup was easy and within 10 minutes of hooking up the audio/video cables I was watching HD football.Probably the biggest surprise with this TV is the quality of the built in speakers.  The speakers create a pseudo-theater sound that I was not expecting.Bottom line is that this TV is great.

I am a dish network installer, so i see hd flat panels everyday in customers houses.. the company i work for sells jvc and panasonic plasma and lcd tvs..  in my opinion very few of them come close to the picture quality of this set.. dont get me wrong, there are still nice sets out there, but the accuracy of the color, and the clarity of this set just cant be beat in my opinion... it looks amazing with xbox 360, and blu ray.  dishnet has some truly UNREAL content, and this set shows it in amazing plasma colors..  here it is october 2009, and it still looks as good as the day i bought it.. in my opinion, as the price of flat panel sets have come down, so has the quality.. i wouldnt hesitate to buy another toshiba plasma..","Date":"October 6, 2009"}

During that time it has been OK with a couple of quirky things, like low buzzing sounds when it is switched off.  The cabinet is very contemporary, the sound is very good considering the speaker grill is an inch wide and three inches deep. It has ample inputs and outputs.  In all a nice set...until exactly two months out of warranty the picture went haywire.  UPDATE - After nearly three months, Toshiba issued a full manufacturers' credit towards another TV.  The repair shop said we were extremely luck, if it were most any other brand, it would be too bad for us.  Our present TV is a Sharp Aquos LCD, and the sound and picture are not quit as good, even though the Toshiba was a much lower resolution.  (The newest Toshiba LCD's were not avaialable at the time).  Kudos to Toshiba for doing the right thing.  You have truly earned our loyalty to your brand!","Date":"January 24, 2007"}

{"Title":"Perfection","Author":"Bob North","ReviewID":"R1UVJV29OTX0WP","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is stunning. It is fairly simple... but it takes a few days to understand the subtle adjustments that make it perfect for you. I think that many people experience quick negative reactions to electronics... before taking a little time to learn how to properly operate the device. My tip is to read manuals in advance... something that becomes easy via Internet.The TV I replaced is a Sony 32XBR100... probably the best analog TV ever made. I loved using it for ten years with never a slight problem. It is on its way to a happy new home and life... which is saying a lot because it weighs 160 pounds. I have had my eye on HD for years. I have seen them all. There have been some fantastic products... but I will never be spending ten or more thousand on a TV... even if it comes with an all expense paid two week trip to Hawaii and a life supply of pineapple.I recently bought an excellent 23 inch HD Sony for a bedroom. On a return to the store for a cable... I stopped in my tracks for the Sony Bravia KDL-V40XBR1. This is a store with all 50 or so beautiful HD TVs on the planet. I thought, how did I miss this one. Well it just came out. I studied up, read the manual, checked around. It is rarely in stock as of this week. But, there it is. May I say that, yes... you can get a better image in SD on this than I could on my old perfect analog XBR. And, the HD is magnificent both via local cable and Direct TV.Since I was already equipped for a heavy tube TV, I thought that I would finally get Sony's 34 inch HD XBR which is said to be the standard for image. But, the new Bravia 40 inch is too spectacular to turn away from and the elegant style is a huge relief from watching TV on a device as big and heavy as a mule. No more 200 pound television for me.I am fussy as hell. I stopped buying anamorphic dvds because my 32XBR100 could not do them resolution justice on that expensive first Sony player that weighs as much as an armadillo. I have a great collection of standard aspect ratio classic movies. Now, I guess I should wait to buy dvd's until the new HD's arrive.Yes, it seems that my new Sony should have come with two HDMI sockets, but I will live through that omission. There are a lot more important issues to consider... but this TV is perfection. Sony may not have perfect sales instincts, but they are the best at making the best electronics that normal people can afford... if we remember that we Americans are not normal in this world of starvation and suffering. Sorry, it is embarrassing to be this fond of a consumer product... have to put it in perspective.","Date":"October 16, 2005"}
{"Title":"I love this TV so much ...","Author":"E. Lee \"E. Lee\"","ReviewID":"R1AHX9MONTTBTO","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought two!  It true what they say about LCD TVs: the color saturation in not as rich as plasma TVs (the blacks are not as dark).  But what LCD TVs have is crystal clear, crisp moving pictures.  The 1080i picture quality of the Bravia 40 is so sharp its simply amazing.  I have seen many plasma TVs including the Pioneer Elite and the Bravia 40 beats them for clarity.  And if you set the Color Space from Normal to Wide, the colors are simply more vibrant.  (I am not sure why this is not the default setting for this TV).As a bonus, this TV also comes with a built in HD tuner and I can use it to pick up HDTV broadcasts using an antenna or using my cable company's basic service.  The other thing I like about this TV is that is has a VGA connector to connect to my laptop and the picture and sound quality there is excellent too.  LCD TVs don't suffer from the picture burn-in that plasma TVs do.  They are much lighter in weight.  And they have a longer life span.  The speakers are wimpy so buy a good home theater system to do this TV justice.","Date":"March 13, 2006"}

With a resolution of 1360x768 through the VGA connector, this LCD has better resolution than its plasma counterparts of this size, and no need to worry about burn-in on an LCD. TV quality is excellent as well--even stanard definition isn't bad, though you should not have expectations that any flat HDTV will do standard def justice compared to a CRT.Many inputs are available, though I agree it would be nice to have a second HDMI input. The TV is surprisingly light for its size and comes with a nice stand, or can be mounted.","Date":"November 15, 2005"}

I had heard before many times about the advantages of LCD screens comparing to the Plasma (no burned pixels, no life limit etc.), but I must say that the LCD technology has finally matured to a fine level. This model offers a 178 degree view and I have mounted it on a wall, 90 cm from the floor, where despite its weight of 40 kg it looks marvellously elegant. The set is just 12 cm thick (I think the smallest thickness I have seen in TV sets of this size) and there is no complexity at all for anyone who has the slightest exeperinece with older Sony devices.","Date":"March 8, 2006"}

I am quite satisfied with my choice so far!  I have had the tv for close to 2 months and ran it through the ringer with different applications.  Xbox, PS2, Gamecube, Xbox 360, upconversion dvd player, and digital cable.  Every application on this tv looks spectacular, excellant color depths, wonderful deep blacks(which can be hard to come by with lcd), and phenominal picture quality in all HD settings.The one complaint that I have with this tv is that it is quite time consuming to get the settings right with dffferent setups.  I went through numerous changes in my A/V equipment and each time I changed a cable I spent obscene amounts of time adjusting the picture quality again.  Although with that being said the hours upon hours of adjustment that I made to the set in order to get the picture to my likings was well worth the end result.Video games, even the last gen systems(xbox, ps2, and gamecube) look awesome with the right component cables.  Xbox 360 will blow your socks of and leave in you in complete awe of the clarity and crispness of a console video gamer.  Dvd's through HDMI is incredible and will have you glued to the tv for days!Bottom line if you have the 3 grand to put down on a tv.. this is the one!!","Date":"June 2, 2006"}

I purchased it because Sony just seems to have better products. I purchased this model when I saw it at the store next to other plasmas and lcds.  If anyone is looking to purchase this I would suggest going and comparing it side by side.  The picture is incredible compared to other brands.  You will see what true black is compared to other tvs.After a year of owning this I find that the picture is very dark.  I have tried playing with all the settings and cannot get it to brighten up.  I am going to contact sony to see if there is a patch or something for this. Probably in 6 months I will have to replace it because I won't be able to see anything.Also, although I am sure that it would be the same for all wide screen tv's, when you watch something it is not on the full screen so you have a black border around the entire picture.  If I modify it to make the picture wider or zoom in it distorts the pictures and cuts off the closed caption.At its current price I would recommend itI will be looking at replacing this this tv shortly.","Date":"February 10, 2007"}

Elaine Fanady \"Mrs F\"","ReviewID":"R1GEXN61VH72KR","Overall":"good","Content":"*Updated, since we've gone another year of heavy usage with this TV, and it's still as good as the day we bought it. We leave it on in the evenings, whether or not we're watching it (I like the background noise, and news), so we're probably going on 5,000 hours.For those of you who have had the \"popping\" problem, it would help the rest of us owners (whose TVs are still fine after well over 2 years) to know:(a) What was the manufacture date of your TV?(b) When did you buy the TV?(c) What time of year (month/season) did it \"pop\"?(d) What is your setup? Wall-mount? Stand?(e) Is the area behind the TV well ventilated?*The previous few questions are only because plasma TVs use a lot of power, and of course will run hot (just feel the back after a couple hours). One of the number 1 rules to owning a plasma is to use it in a VERY well ventilated area.(f) What were your TV settings most of the time? Brightness/Contrast? Low/Regular power? Did you lower the settings for the first 200 hours as recommended for all plasmas?(g) How many hours a day did you typically run the TV?I only suggest that people update their reviews with more info, because it might make a difference as to how the owners of working sets continue with their current setup.  If it turns out many of the \"poppers\" were hung on the wall in a room with no venilation behind it, or right up against a wall, or anywhere near a heater/vent, or left on for several hours at a time - that's going to make a huge difference, and it might help others preserve their TVs, saving from the same outcome. The average owner might not be aware of the proper care and setup of their plasma, which could lead to some (of course not all) of the unhappy buyers of this TV.Just a thought.Even if it dies, we had some good times.","Date":"January 13, 2008"}

I spent dozens of hours checking reviews and comparing the different 50\" plasma tv's before deciding on this purchase. The quality of this set is at least, if not better than most of the higher-priced plasma tv's.The table stand is plenty sturdy for those who do not wish to hang the tv. It even comes with built-in hooks on the back of the set to anchor it while using the stand (which I did since it sits on my fireplace mantel).Most of the reviews that listed a weakness for this tv were because the case is silver instead of black. For the price difference and the quality of the tv, I believe this is a minor thing. I actually like the silver case (it's not overly shiny or brassy).I'm also extremely impressed with the integrated HDTV. There are a good number of ratio's that allow you to zoom in on the action.

{"Title":"MUST read if you never own HDTV","Author":"mom to 3 boys","ReviewID":"R1R1HYWZDX9QA2","Overall":"good","Content":"We were so excited to be buying a new TV since we read so many reviews here on Amazon about how great plasma TV are, I read a lot about SD channel and HD channel not being the same and I really didn't understand what was being said. But when I read people's reviews on how great the picture was and since I owned a zenith before we decided to order this plasma because it can be hung on the wall. After it arrived, we hook it up (which was easy) turn it on to our local news and were extremely disappointed in the picture.The color was a bit dull, and the picture was a little bit fuzzy, we read the manual and adjusted the setting but still the picture wasn't that great, but not really bad either just not prefect liek you would thinking. We went to a local electronic store thinking maybe we had the TV set up wrong. We were told in order to get that perfect picture we need to buy an HD receiver, HD cables and HD service. Since it is a HDTV it only make sense to have all the right HD connection, so we bought everything suggested and still the picture on our local channels, USA, CNN, Life etc.. was not that great.I called our satellite company thinking maybe there was something wrong with their service because all the reviews had said how great the picture was on this TV and our TV definitely did not a have a beautiful picture. Then I was told to turn to an HD channel YES the picture on HD channels are absolutely beautiful, crystal clear, the colors are outstanding and I see where people get thier great reviews from. But any channel that is not HD really isn't that great, the color is a bit dull and fast moving objects will be blurry. I was told that is how regular channels are on HDTV are!! ONLY HD CHANNELS will be crystal clear (that is why circuit city and best buy always have HD discovery on their TVs for sell so you'll see that beautiful picture and buy it), the only problem with that is there are ONLY 5 HD channels in our area: Discovery, 2 espn, HBO and showtime that is IT!!!So when a review say SD channel or standard channel aren't that great they mean about 200 of your channels (whether it's cable or satellite) will not be that prefect, all HD channel on the other hand will be Outstanding but if you don't watch that much discovery then you might be very disappointed in the picture.Before buying any HDTV whether it's plasma, LCD or DLP you need to find out how many channel are HD channel are in your area?? If not that many then you might want to keep your old TV. We return and purchased several plasma TV over the weeks trying to find one with the best regular (SD, Standard) channels and zenith was the best, Phillip had the worse.The best suggestion I can give anyone if your looking at buying a new TV at a store, ask them to change the TV to a NON-HD channel and then pick the one with the best picture don't pick the tv that has a HD channel on because when you get it home and flip it to CNN you'll be disppointed.","Date":"February 20, 2006"}

The picture in 1080i is like cable modem compared to dial up.  You simply don't want to go back to the past.  I've read some reviews stating that soon after the 1yr MFG warranty was up so went their screen.  Well why buy an expensive TV without an extended warranty? Some people say it's a waste of money, not me, and some of the other reviewers probably wish they weren't so stubborn with the money they spent, spend an extra $300 or so and get the warranty. Like having a car without insurance.  This TV was purchased at CC for around $1300 (floor model) but was listed for $1799, they threw in a $300 surge protector and took of another $100.  So for that price the extended warranty was purchased, if it were $3000 then I would be afraid to plug it in without the extended warranty.  Now the sound I have no idea of, a samsung 5 disc DVD 5.1 surround sound was bought with it, just couldn't imagine watching a 50\" plasma without surround sound.  As far as burn ins and pixels, I thought I had a burn in.  AMC was burned in the picture when I turned the TV off, but when I turned the TV back on for a few minutes, turned back off, it was gone.  I guess it just had to warm up.  If you want to see and hear something amazing, try Discovery HD!  Oh don't buy an expensive HDMI (Munster) Cable.  Go online and buy one for $10, not $100 at the store!  So for some of you who payed $3000, ouch!

I tried to do some research before getting it but the tv was just getting released to the market I think so I couldn't find too many reviews. So I picked it up and got it delivered and it's been great ever since. I just wish it had more HDMI inputs, but other than that it's a great tv for the price!!HD channels look flawless, SD channels don't look too bad since there's nothing to do about the low resolution at which SD channels are broadcasted.I recently bought the samsung blu-ray player and hooked it up to the TV via HDMI and you have no idea how great the graphics where even though the highest resolution you can get out of the tv is 1080i.Also, I got the 4 year insurance plan just in case something should happen to it like it did to one of the reviewers in this section.Quick tip for those who already own it: I was told at the store and read at some websites to limit the contrast to 50% or 60% the first month or two, to extend the life of the screen, also there's a Low Power option which I usually have it turned on to help prolong the life of the tv.And for the gamers: don't worry too much about burn-ins, there's an ISM option called ORBITER that helps a lot, I found that using the White Wash ISM Method (after playing video games for hours) gets rid of any burn-in on the screen.So get it if you still can!!!","Date":"November 23, 2006"}

I'll bust some myths:  The sales people @ B3$T B^Y said you MUST get HD channels because the regular channels will \"burn up\" your screen with all the static and bad signal (yea right).  Actually, the regular channels didn't look that bad.  Of course when you get to the real HD channel you won't want to leave them- they look great.  The built in HD receiver also allows me to see a bunch of SD and HD channels I don't actually pay for.I play games ALL the time and I haven't caused any burn-in in the last year.  If you keep it on a news channel, then turn TV off, then turn it on the next day- you WILL see some remnant of the previous day's video for a few seconds- but it quickly goes away.They also said you must buy the expensive component cables and HDMI cable for the DVD upconverter.  These are for true videophiles. It is hard to tell the difference unless you REALLY look. And if you look THAT close you will notice the 1 or 2 dead pixels you get and you'll just get made.My TV has 1 dead pixel and it bummed me out, but you really can't notice it- unless you look for it.Since this thing costs $3000+ definitely get the extended warranty for peace of mind. It sure helped me, after 11 months- my Zenith went \"pop\" and is now dead.  I assume it is the power source or light box- don't know yet- but they are replacing it.The store no longer carries Zenith, so I assume we will get an LG: 50PC3D (basically the same tv). Other than it breaking, I've been very happy.  I did a lot of research before buying this tv and never heard any problems about this, so it may be isolated.","Date":"October 27, 2006"}

Tamburello","ReviewID":"R5D8WURPRJ7XH","Overall":"good","Content":"Maybe there was a bad batch of these TVs manufactured all around the same time, or maybe all of the people having problems didn't READ the warnings about NOT setting the brightness/contrast over 50 for the first few months.  Wall mounting for the first few months is probably also a bad idea as it needs very good ventilation during the break-in period.  Running it in low power mode if it's been on over 5 or so hours is probably a good idea too...  I've had this TV for about 3 years now, and I've easily used it over 10,000 hours, watching TV and playing a LOT of Xbox 360.  I made sure I set the brightness and contrast both on 50 for the first 3-4 months of use, and made sure it's very well ventilated in the back (I didn't wall mount).  So far, it's been flawless - the HD picture quality rivals that of MUCH more expensive TVs, and the SD picture isn't too bad either.  These TVs may have a Zenith logo on the front, but they're made directly by LG (you can even see the LG logo on some of the circuit boards through some of the ventilation holes on the back), so you get to enjoy an otherwise expensive LG HDTV at a generic HDTV price.

So if your old TV dies now, your best bet it to probably get an HDTV because as the new regulation goes into place, you'll need to buy an HD converter for your non-HDTV which doesn't make sense.

{"Title":"A very good value","Author":"T. TRAN","ReviewID":"R1SZXP0C4P7BC0","Overall":"good","Content":"At $499 ($699 minus $200 rebate at CompUSA), this model LT26HVX (not the HVE) with a decent spec (800:1 brigtness, 1200:1 contrast, 8ms response time) is worth every penny. The weak spot is perhaps the standard mode display which is subpar but only when compared with top of the line models only. I watched it alongside other top models like Sony, Sharp, Panasonic, Samsung and the diff is just 9/10.  WHen used with HD OTA broadcast or DVD movies at home, I found the picture quality is quite nice.WHen used as a computer monitor, unlike some complaints in here, I have had no problem using a DVI-D dual link cable at a resolution of 1280x1024. No additional software, no issue whatsoever. Any issue must be from the cable or the graphic card incompatibility. My DVI-D Dual link cable is only $12 from Buy.comOne nice thing about this TV is you can split sources almost at will, including both DVI and VGA allow me to use it as 2 monitors (yes TWO monitors) anyway I like. My Panasonic LCD cannot do this. However, this TV has only 1 SD tuner and no HD tuner.Sound is so so, actually it is a bit loud. Remote is somewhat awkward.At $499, what can I say ?","Date":"February 23, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good Value Brand","Author":"Glenn R. Howes","ReviewID":"R2KIAD5IQZP2DB","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned this TV for two months and have been happy with my purchase. It's big and bright and gives sharp pictures when hooked up via DVI to my cable box. Its handling of old fashioned standard definition is nothing to write home about; I have tweaked and tweaked with no joy. On the other hand, high quality progressive scan DVDs look great over s-Video.  After some serious tweaking, I attached my desktop PC to the monitor via the VGA connection to get a 1360x768 resolution without scaling, but I found it impossible to attach a PC via DVI and get a picture without scaling. Just because it's DVI doesn't mean it's a good PC connection.I didn't bother with the built in speakers. If you want the full HDTV experience, invest in at least a 5.1 speaker system. Good sound is just as important as a hi-def picture. If anything, I wish the speakers were detachable.Switching the inputs via remote is cumbersome, and the menu system as a whole is non-intuitable.In summary, good high definition picture, good selection of inputs, mediocre standard definition, and cumbersome interface.I should also mention that the price of this TV varies wildly from vendor to vendor and from day to day. You would be advised to shop around.","Date":"December 29, 2005"}
{"Title":"Exceptional Value, Best when used with HD/High Res sources","Author":"David E. Taylor","ReviewID":"RHNO4FTADD2YN","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this TV today ($499 at h.h.Gregg - $100 less than the price yesterday) after reading numerous good reviews here and several other places.MY EXPERIENCES/TESTING SO FAR:I have watched 1080i and 720p HDTV sources, as well as 480p DVD, all via component (R,G,B) inputs, and they look great.  I connected my laptop with an nVidia go7900GS graphics card, and found that the only resolution that was decent via the VGA connection was stretched 1024x768 - not so good.  Via the DVI connection, on the other hand, the OS recognized the TV as an HDTV, and asked for the most appropriate HDTV resolution (720p) and it looks excellent (crisp, & not stretched), and a DVD played via Windows MCE looked at least as good as via a nice stand-alone HK DVD player.  I also tested Windows Media HD sample content (720p & 1080p), and they look great, too.  Standard Def, even digital SD are what most would expect from this sort of TV; okay, but not great.  The speakers have received mixed reviews, and all I can say is that they seem fine for what they are - inexpensive TV speakers.  If this is your main media display, by all means get a nice 5.1 setup, but if this is just going to be a secondary TV, the speakers are more than adequate.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and especially so when price is taken into account.","Date":"June 30, 2006"}

{"Title":"Good value","Author":"San Jose Reviewer","ReviewID":"RB0G1U98BXHVS","Overall":"good","Content":"When compared to other LCD TVs, it's a great value! Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.Pros: It has a great picture quality when connected with something besides coaxial cable. It looks great when viewing widescreen DVDs. Speakers are good. It's much cheaper than most other LCD TVs of the same size (at the time when this review was written). The power light remains off when watching TV. It saves different TV settings depending on the video source used, which is good. Good for high def video. It's much lighter and thinner than a tube TV of the same size.Cons: When turned off, the extremely bright power light turns on. The power light doubles as a bright nightlight. I recommend several layers of masking tape or a bit of electrical over this light. When viewing off the air video through coaxial cable (instead of a DVD or PC video), it's very blurry (too many compression artifacts). The \"HDTV Calibration Wizard\" DVD helped to signifcantly reduced the blurriness. Switching video sources isn't as easy as other TVs. If you're usually watching low def video, most TVs like this won't be a good value for you, and a standard tube TV may be better for you.","Date":"May 27, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV","Author":"Gary \"Maldonado\"","ReviewID":"R2H99PZ0VUXEVZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this television as a spare DVD/HD set which doubles as a PC monitor and video gaming TV. It performs very ably all of these functions.The color decoder is surprisingly accurate out of the box at \"Middle.\" The unit calibrates reasonably well with DVE, though I have found that after switching inputs, sometimes the brightness setting is 'off' upon returning to say, the DVI input. It will display the brightness of setting '50' when the slider is actually at 46. A quick trip to the user menu to bump it one tick up or down 'restores' it to the proper brightness for the numerical setting.The black level is average for an LCD panel - not as good as newer higher end sets, but much better than a normal PC monitor, and more than usable for movies. As with any LCD panel, the black level is much more forgiving during bright scenes than in dark ones. The viewing angles (which are not incredibly forgiving as far as PQ goes) play a role in this, also. The advertised 170-degree viewing angle is a gross overestimation - you see something, but not anything close to a high fidelity picture. I would say the real-world viewing angle is 100 degrees horizontal by 70 degrees vertical - still not bad compared to a projection CRT screen, or a laptop or small PC LCD monitor.Buyers should know that this is a 15:9 monitor, not 16:9 - this has no impact on picture quality, it just means very tiny black bars on 16:9 dvds, and slightly larger bars on 2.35:1 material.Nevertheless, for the price, I am stunned that this unit performs as well as it does. I am quite happy with my purchase from that standpoint. The build quality is also very good - this is a solid unit. Less discriminating viewers who make this (or a larger Syntax unit) their first HDTV will likely be blown away.","Date":"February 9, 2006"}

The first TV I bought had 7 dead pixel, so called up syntax and they were happy to replace the TV (though it took them 4 weeks to send the replacement). The new(replacement) one had no pixel issues. The picture quality is great for HD signals and standard defenition picture (my cable box upconverts everything to 1080i) is much better than my regular TV. But the dark areas in the Picture lacks detail. I tried to play around with the TV settings, but no improvement yet. I guess that's the inherent disadvantage of the flat panels. You may want to shell out a lil more and get a nicer flat panel if you want more details in black. But for the price I paid i am ok with the quality of the picture.","Date":"January 31, 2006"}

{"Title":"Problems with using as a computer monitor","Author":"D. Lindsey","ReviewID":"RRVVGU34PSKFC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this LCD for primary use as a monitor for my home computer. Three problems make this less than satisfactory. One, unlike my Toshiba 32 inch, there is no setting to change the blue background to black. This is needed when your computer's power settings \"shut off\" the monitor. It cuts the signal but the screen stays on with a blue background. Secondly, the monitor stand is set at a slightly down angle and does not adjust. I've had to place something under the front of the stand to achieve a viewable angle. Lastly, you cannot change the Aspect in VGA mode.The color and clarity are fine, this monitor would work well as a HDTV if you have an input source as it does not have a tuner. The multiple inputs are a plus.","Date":"March 2, 2007"}

{"Title":"Elegant design, Spectacular Picture","Author":"Dave","ReviewID":"R2EN2FUHAXZXGU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought Sony's 60\" SXRD after spending the last year researching big screen TVs. The picture quality is top notch- blacks on par with those of a CRT or plasma television and stunning visual clarity. The liquid crystal on Silicon (LCoS) technology combines the best qualities of DLP and LCD projection TV sets; the picture quality of Sony's SXRD LCoS impressed me more than JVC's D-ILA LCoS.There is no screen door effect on this TV and it displays motion well. The user interface is very user friendly and I was able to access the vast majority of the television's functions without referencing the user's manual. There are more open inputs than I need (8 total, including a few accessible from the front) and the Picture in Picture can be used from both multiple inputs (e.g. DVD and Cable) or from the same input (e.g. both frames from the cable box)Analog TV appears as good or better than other TVs this size and HD is incredible. With any TV this size, however, be aware that flaws in the picture quality of a broadcast signal will be more apparent. This hasn't been a problem with DVDs or HD channels.The 60\" SXRD also looks more elegant than other sets in this range, nice given that a set this size will dominate any room it's in. It's also light weight enough to be moved easily by two people.I'm happy that I bought this model and strongly recommend it.","Date":"October 26, 2005"}
{"Title":"Stunning picture quality!","Author":"G.E.","ReviewID":"RD377BFX1K2MF","Overall":"good","Content":"I looked at half a dozen 1080p true HDTVs in October 2005 before settling on the KDS-R50XBR1 (the 50\" little brother to this TV).  I am thrilled with the picture quality, especially after fine-tuning the Brightness, Contrast, Picture, and RGB balance settings using the Avia calibration DVD.  Especially on true HDTV 1920x1080 sources, this TV has an absolutely outstanding picture!  In fact, it's more like watching a film or looking out a window than a mere television picture.  The SXRD picture is liquid smooth and silky with no screen door effect or harsh \"graininess\" you see in competing technologies such as DLP, LCD, and even plasma.One important note: If you are debating between the 50\" and 60\" models, you should know that both models use the same 120 watt bulb.  With the 60\" model having approximately 20% more screen surface area to light up, that translates to approximately a 20% dimmer picture than the 50 inch model.  (If you ask me, it's not a \"bright\" idea to use the same bulb wattage for two projection TVs of different sizes, but I guess it keeps manufacturing costs down.)Compare the two models side by side on the same HDTV content (I did) and you'll see a marked difference in the vividness of the whites and bright colors.  The KDS-R50XBR1 50\" really \"pops\" (like looking out the window on a sunny day); whereas the KDS-R60XBR1 60\" looks merely average in the brightness department (the overall picture is still excellent, just a bit dimmer).For me, I decided that a smaller screen with a brighter picture was more important than a big screen with a slightly dimmer picture - especially since this TV sits in a daylight room.  Hopefully Sony will correct this oversight in a future SXRD model because the 60\" picture is considerably more impressive purely from a size perspective.The pros: Its magnificent picture quality!  SXRD is probably the finest picture you can buy for under $12,000.  It has advanced picture fine-tuning feature for prosumers.  The 50\" model has a dazzling bright display that outshines everything I've seen so far.The cons: The side speakers are relatively weak with no bass response (as one would expect from their diminutive size).  They are not detachable, and add a considerable amount of horizontal width to this TV's footprint.  They ought to be made detachable or placed beneath the screen instead at the sides.  Also, there are only 2 HDMI ports.  It is quite conceivable that a person might have 3-4 HDMI devices (Bluray DVD, Playstation 3, Dish Network, Digital Cable, etc.) but most TVs on the market only have 1-2 HDMI ports so this is not unusual.  Daytime viewing is generally very good as long as no direct light hits the TV screen; however, projection TVs still don't seem as bright as the old cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs.","Date":"November 28, 2005"}
{"Title":"Price has decreased 25% in 2 months since introduction and before Christmas/New Years/Superbowl season.","Author":"Elegant_gentleman \"Engineer\"","ReviewID":"R3RQ3PXGOKPRS3","Overall":"good","Content":"I welcome the opportunity to share my perspective as an owner of a SONY SXRD KDS-R60XBR1.  I notice that the Amazon.com price has decreased 25% since the item became widely available in October 2005.  I obtained mine through a traditional brick and mortar retailer, but believe the associates of Amazon.com can perform just as well.  The item performs an excellent job.  Once I had the cable card installed by the cable company the performance was outstanding, the best I've ever seen.  On standard digital (SD) transimissions such as a 4:3 NTSC 480i HBO thru the cable card, I was wondering why the \"16:9 HD\" picture was cropped.  It was an optical illusion.  The clean-up, etc. circuits were that perfect.  There are a minimum of 22 adjusts possible on \"Pro\" view mode.  There are many others that only a ISF certified calibration technician with professional equipment should use for greyscale.  A few notes about the information on this Amazon.com webpage as of 06 December 2005 --- the mass/weight of the item is about 120 pounds, not 300 pounds.  The brightness of the 60\" unit is fine in my living room at mid-day with all the lights on and shades open.  (My windows face west).  Hands down I think it beats the JVC LCOS, any wobulator DLP, and in most situations \"all\" front projectors (which require ideal conditions).  As of December 2005 I have not seen a Hitachi LCOS or LG LCOS, but do not expect them (a first generation product) to be on par with this second generation Sony.  (Sony Quallia was first generation).  I have heard second hand from folks that have visited the trade show in Las Vegas that the Toshiba/Canon SED will not be price competitive.  (Their opinions vary with regrd to performance results of the pre-production SED).  If you have not seen a Sony SXRD LCOS 1080P display being feed with a dedicated source, you owe it to yourself.  NOTE:  Some retailers have Mitsi wobulator DLPs feed one on one by hard drives with true 1080P source.  That is a huge advantage compared to a splitter of over-the=-air HDTV signal.  But it is not realistic for the average consumer.  Before you buy any TV display based on your subject viewing, watch it for 15 minutes and find out the quality of the source feed and how many times it is split upstream of your desired representative product.  Bottom line is it looks like JVC low-balled the prices on their LCOS and retailers are cutting (the substantial) margin on the Sony LCOS SXRD to match.  Sony is adding a 1000 humans and who knows how many robots in their factory in Pittsburgh, PA, USA to crank these babbies out.  If you are a babby boomer, you know the meaning of the Wall Street Journal article of April 2005 that revealed that Sony's business mocel is to  re-establish their dominance of the (HD)TV market with the SXRD in the years 2006, 2007 much like the Sony Trinitron made their reputation in the late 1960's.  Thank you Sony.  I'll report back after my unit is ISF calibrated.","Date":"December 6, 2005"}

I have Direct-tv with S-video hooked up and the bright scenes look fantastic, but dark scenes (blacks and greys) are not to good. (this is not an HD signal which would clean things up a lot) A DVD player with component hookup is much better.I wanted a large display without paying $2000 (typical ballpark price for an HD set the same size) and am very happy with the results. I do not see a difference worth paying the extra $600 for.This set weighs in at 100lbs so be sure you have a solid entertainment center or if you use the wall mount (an extra $150) it needs to contact something substantial. Also the speakers lack depth. They get the job done ok, but with a display like this a surround sound would be a good investment.Remember this is a display, not a set with a tuner. Not a problem with cable, satellite, or DVD players. This has an advantage if you have young children and a universal remote control.

Expecting it the second week in January--according to the information on the order page, I was really shocked that I got the tv yesterday--3 days before Christmas.  The delivery person was great, unpacked the TV, offerred to take the packaging with him, was very neat and courteous.  The picture is Great, and yes, as other reviews stated, the built-in speaker system is lacking compared to what we're used to, but I have several surround sound systems and knew that wasn't a problem, but even without the surround sound, when I watched a DVD, I felt the sound was adequate.

I didn't plan on getting an EDTV, or one this big. Boy am I glad I did! I was also one of the lucky ones that got a free mounting bracket with it. Even w/o the bracket, $799.98 with no tax or shipping was an awesome deal. I actually like this TV so much that I am ordering another. It does not have a ton of input options, but if you are just running TV/DVD through it I think you will be rather pleased with it. This price is so good, I could turn around and sell it for more on Ebay or Craigslist. Also very impressed with Amazon at offering such a good deal, and thankful for the quality customer service I got. I was a bit worried about shipping such a fragile item, but the delivery company they used did a nice job taking care of my TV.","Date":"December 5, 2006"}

But I can barely tell the difference when sitting 12 feet away from the TV.Some cons:No VGA or HDMI input so I can't hook it up with my PC.Monitor only so closed caption is not available (some of my family members need the feature)But I can really not complain more with this price.","Date":"January 22, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great Picture, Style, and Value","Author":"David","ReviewID":"RS1MUYE336AQ3","Overall":"good","Content":"This monitor is an exceptional value that delivers an incredible picture through its plasma display.  Please do note-this is a monitor, not a television.  It only works when set-up with your cable television.  Also, living in a 1950's home apparently did not provide the correct \"grounding\" neccessary for the monitor to function properly and without \"hum\" or lines (a symtom of electronic interference).  To remedy this, just pick up a Monster Power Cable ($80) at your local Best Buy.  With this Monster Power Cable, your cable television gets routed through the Monster Power unit, and then to your plasma monitor, taking care of any electronic interference caused by improper grounding. I hope this little tip on clearing up the \"hum\" lines helps someone else because I know that after having the power company and cable company out and still having problems, it sure was a savior.","Date":"January 16, 2007"}

{"Title":"TV is great, but Sylvania Customer Service is the worst ever!","Author":"J. Harmon","ReviewID":"R2D7USWWZNW4A7","Overall":"good","Content":"I loved this TV for the first 10 months we owned it. One day it stopped turning on. It would try to turn on for about 5 seconds and then shut itself off. I contacted customer service and was assured it was still under waranty and if I faxed them the information they needed, they would contact me when they sent me a box so it could be shipped to a service center to be repaired. Which I promptly did (the same day). After a week I called again to see what was going on and when I could expect the box. I was told it takes 10 days to 2 weeks. I waited another week, nothing. I called again and this time was told it can take up to three weeks, but they would send a form to corporate to have them look into what was going on. I was assured that someone from corporate (as well as someone from the box shipping dept.) would be in touch within a week. I waited another week, still nothing. I called again and was told that the reason nothing had been done was because they couldn't read the date of purchase on the receipt (which they posted on their computer system as received and read 5 days after I faxed it to them). When I asked why no one had called to tell me this, wasting 2 weeks, all anyone could tell me (including a supervisor) was \"I don't know\". I am so fed up with these people I decided to post this to hopefully prevent anyone else from buying this (or any other) Sylvania product and having to endure the customer service hell I am currently stuck in. I have refaxed the information, including a blown up portion of the receipt with the date so no one can claim they can't read it. I am waiting for yet another week to pass so I can call (yet again) and find out what new and even more imaginative excuse they come up with this time. If I do ever get this TV to the repair center, I am praying that the part it needs is still in production so they can fix it. At this point, I can only hope that my heirs do not have to carry on this valiant, although at times flagging fight, in my name. The bottom line is - DON'T BUY ANYTHING THAT CAN BREAK IF IT IS MADE BY SYLVANIA.","Date":"October 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Overall, the best TV I've ever purchased.","Author":"Steven Hallmark \"Human\"","ReviewID":"RIB1DN64LA61R","Overall":"good","Content":"Picture: Even though HDTV was coming into it's own when this TV was purchased, I had never been exposed to it. My first time viewing a downscaled HDTV image through this set blew me away. The colors are bright and vivid. The contrast ratio is excellent. The set handles fast motion flawlessly, making watching sports fantastic. All this time later, I still watch this tv regularly and it's image is beautiful. That being said, this is an EDTV, not an HDTV. It does not display at a full 720p, but does handle downconverting very well, and delivers very impresssive image quality (Much, much better than my Sylvania 32\" LCD TV) The picture, while not rivaling a good HDTV, still blows a 480p set out of the water.Sound: Garbage. It's not good at all. While the volume is adequate, the sound is muddy and monotone. I don't even think it has stereo sound even if it claims to. You will want to hook this set up to an auxiliary sound source.Inputs: It has 2 RCA connections (1 bottom, 1 side) and 2 component video inputs (bottom). These are extremely difficult to access when mounted, and not very easy to access just sitting on the stand. If you're going to hang this TV, plug your wires in first if you can. Notice that I didn't list any HDMI connections. It doesn't have any. I don't think it has an S-Video input, but I'm not sure. I've never used S-video; has anyone? Regardless, you'll need to use the component for best image quality.Reliability: 7 years in, I'd say I'm qualified to comment on this. I've never had an issue with this TV. I've never had a burn in issue (unlike my Samsung 50\" plasma, which also had other pixel flickering issues). It performs flawlessly every time I turn it on.Important note: This is a display only. It has no tuner. This will not be an issue if you have cable or a satellite provider, but if you want to watch over the air HDTV, you'll need to purchase a tuner.Appearance of the set itsself: It has extremely thick borders by todays standards. I estimate this 42\" TV is as large if not larger than a thin line 47\" LED tv. It does look a little dated.In summation; This is a great TV. I can't imagine paying 500 dollars for one at this point (that's what I paid at a black friday sale for mine back in 2006). With the constantly dropping prices on all flat panel TVs, I honestly can't see another one being sold for any use other than business purposes (ads, in building announcements). I'd say it's strongest point is it's all day every day reliability combined with it's bright colorful picture. I simply love mine so much I felt compelled to review it.","Date":"August 11, 2013"}

Some people mentioned having to pay shipping and handling, but I didn't have to do that. So I paid a total of about $900. The picture quality for HD channels is great---clear, crisp, distinctive colors and gives you an almost \"there\" feeling. As another reviewer mentioned the sound isn't that great, but for the TV sound that's fine and only a bit of a problem when I listen to music. Another minor issue I have is that the screen seems to continually have marks on it that only show when the TV is off. Other than that I think I got an absolutely wonderful bargain.

The picture is really amazing. It looks great with regular cable channels, DVD's as well as the ps2. Everything looks great! I highly suggest this monitor to anyone, especially for the price. I am given this a 4 star because of the mount that came with the tv as a \"package\" deal at checkout. The mount that amazon suggest in the package deal 22\" To 49\" Universal Flat Wall Mountwould not work for me. I ended up at walmart a day after getting the monitor, and I was buying another mount. I would suggest the mount at walmart for $88. It is very very sturdy and fit perfectly! Another problem I ran into is that the wall studs were 24inches apart and not 16 like most load bearing walls. That caused the mount that amazon sent to not work as it was 19inches wide and obviously would not work for 24inch studs. I did not return the original mount, instead sold it to a friend who bought a smaller flat panel that would work with this mount. Other then the mount problem, everything else was great. Oh, and I have not tried the speakers on the monitor at all, as I have a surround sound system that I connected instead. Keep in mind this is ONLY A MONITOR and you will need a tuner of some sort. I have a dvd recorder with tuner and several inputs, I simply ran my component plugs to the monitor and that was it.Grab this monitor while you can at this price and you wont be disappointed one bit!I am posting some pictures also.

{"Title":"Not Bad for the Money","Author":"A. Slavin","ReviewID":"R8766K7WCMN7R","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV from Amazon, 3 years ago.  We live in a very narrow row home, so I was looking for an inexpensive flat panel to replace my large bulky TV.  Space-wise it's great!  Picture quality is average.  Sound quality is poor.First, the picture is not high quality but I knew that going in.  I was not sure what to expect.  I was satisfied with the product when I received it.  It's not great but it's good enough.  However, for the price it could be considered great.As for the sound quality, it sucks!  The speakers are located on the sides facing the back of the TV.  Who sits behind a TV?  When we turn the sound up close to it's highest possible volume, the sounds starts to get even more muffled than usual.  This is just poor engineering.The remote that is included is huge and bulky.  We have comcast cable.  We tried to program the cable remote to Sylvania with no luck.  So we have to used 2 remotes.  The cable remote switches the channels and the TV remote controls the volume and the power.Other than that, this TV has S-video and RCA input jacks.  That is a plus because we connect out laptops to the TV.  It also has output Audio jacks for surround sound.  If this is the way you are going then the TV speakers shouldn't matter much.Lastly, remember that this is a monitor and does not have a tuner!!!  If you do not have cable you will be using a VCR or DVD for the tuner (most VCR/DVD combos have them, not all DVD players do).  This transmits a hum from the VCR/DVD tuner.  We have cable and it eliminates hum.  So if you have cable, that should not be an issue.Overall, I give it 3 stars becuase it served us well for the last 3 years but with the new technology and prices dropping, I would buy something with a tuner and better sound quality now.","Date":"April 27, 2009"}
{"Title":"Pleasantly surprised","Author":"Swenocha","ReviewID":"R1X7NCREC36VFM","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought this during the under $600/free ship period in late '06.  Was looking to buy a true HD, but the price was very hard to pass up.  Did some research and concluded that ED would work for us considering how much $ we were saving, so we pulled the trigger.  Quick delivery and no problems with the setup/hanging (bought the wal-mart mount as others suggested).Here's my take on the TV:- Picture is great with HD signal.  I didn't know what to expect the HD 1080i signal to look like on an ED monitor, but I would say that if I didn't know it was ED, I'd certainly think it was HD (as long as I didn't get too close).  Colors are bright and crisp, blacks are dark, etc.  All around great experience.  I and my kids are totally addicted to DiscoveryHD now, and March Madness was outstanding...- Picture is better than true HD monitor for SD signal.  I've seen SD Comcast signals on friend's HD monitors, and this one looks a lot better.  Still looks awful when compared to the HD, but the upconvert is a lot less, so the picture looks better.  Same goes for DVDs.- Got a component hookup for my PS2 (yeah, I know I need to move up, but I don't play enough to justify the PS3 purchase right now, and the PS2 meets my needs).  It looks so much better than the RCAs.  Got Gran Turismo 4 (which is 1080i), and it looks magnificent.- Sound is awful, but I intended to hook it to my wired surround sound anyway, so I don't care.Very happy with the purchase.  We may look to get a true HD at some point and hang this one in the bedroom or office, but for now we are very pleased with this as our primary TV.","Date":"May 23, 2007"}

We had read the reviews posted by others who had purchased this same item, so we did not expect great sound (10 watts). It turns out that in our small area, the sound was just right. The main difference you will notice is that the sound is mono not stereo, but the picture quality is AWESOME! The TV menu give you several choices for picture quality (Dynamic, News and Movie), as well as choices for widescreen, full screen, etc.As long as you are not trying to fill in a large area with sound, the tv alone, if you can ajust to the mono sound, or the tv combined with a not-so-expensive home theatre/surround sound will give you a high quality super plasma tv experience at a fraction of the cost.","Date":"January 18, 2007"}

There was also a rebate for the Mustang tilt wall-mount ($89.99). I don't have an HD tuner yet (probably upgrade my Comcast soon) but with regular SD (using S-video) the picture is fine. DVD's are excellent, crystal-clear picture and like the other reviews state, the audio isn't good. I have this hooked up to a surround-sound system - definately the way to go. The speaker are in the back and can sound muffled if it's too far away. The shipping company Amazon uses(Eagle)is... fair. I checked the tracking information every day to see how it was coming along, it arrived in Atlanta (where I live) and sat for 2 days before I decided to call and find out why it was just sitting there. They told me I needed to set up an appointment to have it delivered. I made an appointment for the next day between 8-noon. At 12:30, no one had arrived so I called. I was told the driver was running a little late and would be there within an hour. At 4:30, still no-show. I called back and got dispatch. It turns out the driver was told to put me off and make another delivery 3 hours away because the customer wouldn't be home after 3pm. It was finally delivered at 7:30pm. The delivery guy was very nice and I could tell it had been a long day for him. So, bottom line; I paid $699 for the set with free shipping, no taxes and a free wall-mount. I also had to spend a day waiting for it along with time and effort to get it delivered at all. Not a bad deal in the end.","Date":"January 14, 2007"}

Because we do not intend on getting an HD subscription, I decided to go with an ED-TV instead of an HD set.  I did a lot of independant research before purchasing this one.  After owning it for almost 3 weeks, I am happy with my purchase.  When I read that this TV does not have a tuner I was afraid of having problems connecting it but if you have read any of the other reviews, rest assured you will be able to connect it to a Cable Box, DVD, or even VCR.  My only gripe with this TV is the ambient sound that it makes.  I bought this TV after reading all the reviews that were written at the time, none of them mentioned a humming sound that the TV makes when it is on.  The sound is light and I have learned to ignore it.  This is something that I could not do if I had paid more for it than I did.  Otherwise, the set is nice, the picture is very clear and overall, I am happy with my purchase... oh, and another thing, the delivery people were very curtious and careful!","Date":"January 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"Excellent monitor - lousy service!","Author":"Merrick","ReviewID":"R2FLD9IKS9QY1C","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a truly excellent monitor. If you like Sony, you won't be disappointed by this choice.The entire delivery process, on the other hand, was a nightmare.Like most people, I can't be home during approximately banker's hours that most delivery companies work on. And when you're expecting a $3000 delivery, you're concerned about the details from the beginning. And the beginning is where dissatisfaction with the shipping process started.This monitor was purchased through Amazon from TigerDirect.It wasn't until the day after the order was confirmed with Amazon that any information regarding the order appeared on the TigerDirect website. Then, all that appeared on the TigerDirect site was an indication of the order with no shipping information. A tantalizingly labelled link stated that shipping information could be had by registering with TigerDirect. So I registered. And after handing some information over to them that I would rather not have in order to register (though they already in theory had it from Amazon - but now with my explicit permission) the link lead me to the highly informative message (read sarcasm here) that no shipping information exists on the website, but that shipping information could only be obtained via e-mail. So I waited - another day - and finally got my html-enabled e-mail confirmation stating that my package was shipped via UPS and that all I had to do was click the UPS button to track my package. Do I have to state, at this point, that there was no UPS button on the e-mail? And that there was no tracking information, either?After calling TigerDirect I finally was able to learn that in fact my package had not been shipped via UPS, but by a shipping company called ABF.So, I called ABF. ABF knew they had the package, but didn't have any idea where it was or when it would be delivered. They would call me. So I checked to make sure they had the right phone number. They had my home phone, which would of course be completely useless during their normal operating hours, so I gave them my cell number. Several days later, no call. So I called them. \"Oh, it'll be a while,\" was the response. So, a day later I called again. After talking with the person on the phone trying to get some useful information, the person suddenly asked, \"is this a business or residential delivery?\" A full week after the order and they didn't even know that! When I told her it was a residential delivery she said, \"oh, we don't do those, we hand those off to our shipping partner, ABC. Let me check... you can expect a call from them tomorrow.\" Tomorrow was Friday.I waited until 5:30 ET on Friday and did not receive a call from ABC (seriously, I'm not making these names up) - nothing. So I called ABF. Now, the ABF website clearly states that their office hours are from 8 AM to 6 PM CT M-F. So I was calling 90 minutes before the office should have closed. I got the service that answers there calls after hours. I asked if they had any idea who ABC was and how I might reach them. Of course, they had no clue. Checking ABF's website after the call, however, did confirm that the package had been handed off to ABC. Well, that's useful (sorry, sarcasm again).When I finally got hold of the ABC Monday morning (after calling ABF to get their contact information - I know, I should have asked for it as soon as I found out ABC existed) the person at ABC told me that I could expect a call that afternoon. At that point I gave them the correct phone number, because, of course, ABF had given them the wrong one.They didn't call. So I called at 5. The person on the other end said that a delivery had been scheduled between 9AM and 1PM for the following day. My response that I could not meet the delivery and that no one had called me to set it up was met with silence. After a little more silence I said, \"well, I'm sorry, but I have meetings all morning, and I'm simply not going to be there.\" \"OK,\" was the response.I got home about 90 minutes later. I found a message on my *home* answering machine - with a time stamp about 15 minutes later than I had called in the morning and when I was told to expect a call in the afternoon - requesting me to call back to schedule delivery. I also found a second message time stamped about 15 minutes after the 5PM call I made, apparently from the driver, saying please call him in the morning, let's try to work a delivery out.So, I called at 6AM - which is actually when the office opened. \"Sorry, that's out on the truck for delivery.\" So, I left for work. I wanted to get in early to get as much done before my meetings as I could and possibly be home for an afternoon delivery. At 6:45, as I was arriving at work, my cell phone rang. \"Hi, I'm at your house with your delivery - where are you?\" If someone had told me they'd attempt delivery at 6:45, I could have stayed home. Oh well.This is now getting too long, so I'll stop here, but suffice it to say I had about 10 more extemely frustrating phone calls to and from ABC regarding this shipment before I finally took delivery. Apparently most people can just take a half-day or full-day off at literally a moments notice so that shippping companies feel they don't have to give any warning to customers.As I said at the beginning - a nightmare.","Date":"July 14, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excelent HDTV for the Price!!","Author":"C. Gimpel \"viper\"","ReviewID":"R2LN7VK1B59NWL","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for about a month and I'm quite impressed with the image quality running from a HD source.  The problem is that if you don't have a HD source like cable (Direct TV) or a DVD with HDMI or SVideo connected to it.... then you'll get the normal video source which can be a let down if your video signal is not OK.  The main issue here is that there's people that still think that because this TV is HDTV capable, that then it'll improve the image source one already has and this is definitelly not the case. And here's where buyers should be carefull since the electronic shops which carry HDTV units have them hooked up to HD TV signals and that's when people get convinced that they need one of these. Now if you're going to hook it up to a Home Theater then this is a very good choice for the value and the features given.If you happen to own an Xbox 360 (which I hopefully will one day, now I've got the first Xbox), then the image should be impressive.  I've already hooked this unit to my Xbox and a Toshiba RD-XS52 DVD Player/Recorder and with something like this you definitely take advantage of the features the n3260w has. The  RD-XS52 comes with HDMI cable and setting of up to 1080p resolution and with it, you really start to notice the difference between a good video signal and a poor one.The n3260w's colors are very crisp though you need to do some tweaking like other reviewers have explained and the menu for the TV is not the best one out there, I'm still having trouble with the PiP.These cons put aside.... this unit is definitely worth the money and should be wall mounted since it really looks nice that way.  The wall mount kit is a very solid one and I would say it guarantees your TV won't fall of the wall if it is mouted correctly due to the materials from which it has been made.I would've given the TV a 5 star review but I'm still working on the PiP configuration and have struggled with the menu but other than that I definitely recommend this purchase.","Date":"June 5, 2006"}
{"Title":"Excelllent TV and Excellent Value","Author":"Brad M. Cassagne \"Computer Buff\"","ReviewID":"R2GVE5XW0BFOS7","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV has several nice improvements over last year's model (I have one of each).  The menu's are nicer and easier to navigate.  The controls for volume and channel are now on the lower right which makes them easy to reach for a wall mount.The mounting bracket is now centered like most flat panels.  There are 2 component video inputs now that can be used for HD or SD signals.  The picture and sound quality are quite good also.The only complaint I have is that the native resolution is not 1280x720.  The upconverting to 1366x768 cause some quality loss which is impossible to avoid on flat panels.  You can run the video at 1:1 sampling but then you get the black border and a 30\" tv for the price of a 32\".  The loss of quality is rarely noticable and is never obvious.  I forgot about this issue very quickly.  I've had this TV in my garage for a month and so far the humidity has not been a problem.","Date":"May 9, 2006"}

What you need to do is PRESS THE \"TV\" BOTTON on the top left corner.

{"Title":"Very good plasma TV for the money","Author":"Mark Glass \"computer gardener\"","ReviewID":"R2FXHT048R1778","Overall":"good","Content":"After shopping for several months I finally took the plunge and purchased this TV from a national chain.  I finally decided plasma over DLP because of the vertical fading effect I saw with all the DLP sets. I took two of my own DVDs in to the store with me and made the staff there hook up a player so I could see both the fast action of The Matrix and the beautiful scenery of Spring, Summmer, Fall, Winter, Spring.  The picture on the Samsung HP-S5053 was the second best of the many plasmas that I examined. The Pioneer had a better picture but was significantly more expensive.  I do not use the built in speakers because I had an existing 5.1 speaker system.  I really like the  minimal black casing since the silver finishes are distracting-at least to my eye.  The menus are extremely intuitive.  I didn't have to read the instructions at all to get anything working within an hour of unpacking my system.  I purchased an upconverting DVD player and an HDMI cable at the same time I purchased this TV.  My old DVDs look great on this TV.  The 10-15 HD channels I get with Cox cable also look incredible.  The one fault I've found is that if I use the HDMI cable from my cable box or DVD player and connect to the TV and then connect the digital audio out of the TV to my receiver I only receive stereo sound even when the original broadcast is 5.1.  I get around this by using composite video cables from the cable box and DVD player to the HPS5053 and also run a digital audio line from each source to the receiver.  The HPS5053 has plenty of inputs to support almost any type of user.","Date":"October 15, 2006"}

{"Title":"Superior Picture Quality at an Amazing Value!!","Author":"B. Underwood","ReviewID":"R1PTH51L13X8OI","Overall":"good","Content":"After spending much time reading reviews and spending hours at the local Magnolia home theater center seeing the displays for myself and playing with the different picture settings and functions, I finally decided on the Samsung HP-S5053 over the Pioneer PDP-5070HD and Panasonic TH-50PX600u. My decision was based primarily on Picture Quality and overall value of the display.Picture quality on the s5030 is simply amazing and in my opinion better than the Panasonic 50px600u and the Pioneer 5070. Panasonic's black level clarity is superior, but the s5030 comes very close, especially with the ability to turn off the DNIe function, and has superior image clarity overall. The Pioneer has great clarity, but a much softer picture overall than the s5030 which provides very sharp and detailed images. Overall, the picture quality is truly stunning and deserves recognition as one of the top plasma displays in this respect. With HD service the detail is unbelievable, whether it be watching sports on ESPNHD or Discovery Theater. I've had the s5053 for 2 months now and the picture just seems to get better and better. I'm 110% satisfied in this respect.In addition to the amazing picture quality, the display it self looks very nice. The piano black finish makes the s5053 look great even when it's not turned on. A huge advantage over the Panasonic's ugly silver cabinet on the 50px600u.The s5053 also had a lot of other features that made the decision easy. The built in tuner, pip, built-in hidden truSurround speakers, pc imput, 2 hdmi input, DNIe, advanced 13-bit processing (549 billion colors compared to a max 29 billion for Panasonic and just over 1 billion for Pioneer), anti-glare filter, and especially the pixel-shift feature (to prevent screen burn-in) were all superior features that made the s5053 an exceptional value.You may read negative reviews based on buzzing and shipping issues, but don't let this discourage you from purchasing this tv. The buzzing issue has been isolated to a limited run of s5053 with an August 06 Mexico manufacture date/location. The good thing is that most of these have already been distributed and replaced, and my unit was buzz free. The shipping issues with screen damage should also not discourage you from buying this display, because lets face it, sometimes things get damaged during shipment due to mishandling or various accidents. My display arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.Overall the Samsung HP-S5053 is a terrific all-around package. You get superior picture quality, a great set of features, and most importantly a great value compared to the other plasma displays in the same top tier. I would highly recommend this unit based on my own extremely positive experience thus far.","Date":"November 17, 2006"}

Inspite of Thanksgiving Day Holidays my TV arrived on the earliest possible date of schedule Nov 27 (Nov 27-Dec 13). The value of shipping Standart Ground was $78, but Amazon discounted it for me down to $0. On the moment of purchase the price of my TV was $2069, and after a three days it went down to $2019, when I called Amazon they immediatelly returned $50 bucks on my credit card. Little unexpected bonus. Customer servise in general is very helpfull. Ordering this TV from Amazon, I literally saved $800 compared to BestBuy and CircuitCity. No tax and free shipping you have got nothing to lose.Delivery \"Eagle\" guys always made calls prior to delivery, initially it was scheduled for delivery at 10 am, but since they were running late waiting for some customers, they called me again and said about it. When delivered, they connected and installed TV without even asking.TV looks fantastic, the image is great. I wanted to buy this TV for a long time. Two reviews made me worry by talking about buzzing noise coming from the back of the screen, well in my case, nothing was standing out. Just like every other plasma TV. May be one guy was unlucky, but the other guy's review history showed there was not a single good review there. If you are thinking of purchasing this TV, go for it. It will go nice and smooth with the Amazon.","Date":"November 27, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great picture but buzzing","Author":"W. Singer","ReviewID":"R2I4STZ57JS1VO","Overall":"good","Content":"After a lot of research on flat screen TVs and hours in electronic stores comparing picture quality, there was no doubt in my mind that this Samsung plasma had definitely the best picture quality in its price segment. I was aware of the buzzing problem that seemed to occur with some units but took the chance. Eagle delivered within about 5 days (standard shipping!). Unfortunately, there was the buzzing from the first start up which is constant and seems to come from the left and right top of the housing. It is definitely not the cooling fan as described elsewhere. Anyways, the buzzing was loud enough to be annoying in quieter scenes from a normal viewing distance. Sad, because I otherwise really liked the TV and the picture quality with my up-converting DVD player was great.I contacted Amazon about this problem. Customer service was very nice and immediately offered either replacement or full refund. I decided to go with the refund for now, I just didn't feel like taking the chance again. By the way, the TV was manufactured in Mexico in September 06.","Date":"December 28, 2006"}

For the price 2019 + free shipping, I couldnt beat it.  I ordered it with the regular shipping and it arrived 5 days later.  I also bought the mustang mount which made putting it on the wall very easy.  There is no buzzing noise that I can notice unless i place my ear against the back of the unit, so they must have fixed that problem.  The only problem is now i don't want to watch anything but HD programming. Regular DVDs also look great on it,and the sound is pretty good for TV speakers. I would definitely recomend this TV to anyone on a budget in the market for a 50\" flatscreen.","Date":"December 4, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good Product, Excellent Experience","Author":"Gary \"Gary R\"","ReviewID":"R2QIQBC99SFJ47","Overall":"good","Content":"I had previously bought the 42 inch version of this Samsung plasma unit and it simply wasn't as big a screen as we had hoped.  We bought it at Best Buy and to return the 42 inch and get a 50 inch meant spending over $1,000 more.  A big gap.  We went to Amazon and the difference was only $400 more, plus free shipping and no sales tax.  EGL was the shipper and fortunately the unit was shipping from the city I live in which is Dallas.  I tracked to EGL and after talking with them, they brought to me the same day (imagine that).  Not only did the shipper open the box to inspect the product, but insisted we plug it up to see that it worked OK.So I plugged it up and connected it to the DirectTV HD receiver and went through a setup routine with the delivery man assisting.  Within 5 minutes we had the unit fully functional with the receiver and the Samsung unit worked flawlessly.  Then the shipper hauled away the box.  A nice service touch.  The unit is great overall with only very minor viewing glitches when very dark screens are presented, the colors don't come out exactly right. But that is an infrequent occurence and it's trivial.  The pictures, particularly the HDTV are beautiful in color, and contrast, brightness and resolution.  The controls are simple (which is no small feat given the various options) and any control is accessible through the remote including 'short cuts' to display options.  I had a 65 inch Mitsuibish HD unit before and the plasma is superior in HD performance and colors.","Date":"November 8, 2006"}

I bought a SONY 46 LCD (46v2500) few months ago and were not totally impressed with the picture and color.  So I decided to give Samsung plasma a try  when I need to buy a TV for my parents. With more than $1000 lower than the Sony I paid, I am so amazed with the quality of this TV. Color is very vivid and image is so sharp. I had totally changed my impression on Samsung. I am not trying to compare orange with apple but I really feel I am getting much more from this TV than the 1080 Sony LCD.  I purchased online and also registered right away.

{"Title":"Buzzing sound RESOLVED!!!","Author":"Vargman","ReviewID":"R2KMVDAHOCAD14","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a lot of research before making my decision to go with the Samsung 50\" Plasma tv model 5053. I was very nervous about this so called buzzing noise, but I took a chance anyway. I purchased the tv from Circuit City because they had the best deal at the time. Yes, right out the box when I first powered the tv up, there was a very loud and annoying buzzing sound. I was sitting about 11 feet away from the tv and the noise was very audible when watching a quiet scene in a movie. My heart was crushed, because the picture on this tv is UNBELIEVEABLE!!! I hooked up a Sony HDMI upconvert dvd player and the picture quality on a movie is just to die for. I called Samsung to complain about the buzzing sound and a technician came to look into the problem. I'm very happy to say that Samsung has finally seemed to isolate this buzzing problem with this particular 50\" model. Two guys showed up and explained to me that they would be lowering the voltage on my plasma tv. They went on to assure me that this would in no way affect the performance of the tv. They unscrewed the back panel and tinkered with the motherboard to lower the voltage current in two specific areas. After that they pulled out some special adhesive strips and taped them onto certain areas of the back panel. They put it all back together and PRESTO!!!! The buzzing sound was reduced to almost nothing. It seems that they really know what they are doing now in regards to this problem. Now, I'm enjoying my tv to the fullest. I have yet to receive my Direct tv package, so I can take advantage of the HD content. You heard it from me. Samsung is GREAT! The two technicians that came over were just awesome and they seemed to know exactly what they were doing. I would say they were at my place for no more than 35 minutes. I sure hope this info helps all of you out there dealing with this buzzing sound.","Date":"April 30, 2007"}

The colors and sharpness of the picture are incredible. When you watch the Discovery channel in HD you won't leave your TV for hours. It's magnificent.Set-up was a breeze.  Don't pay someone $100+ unless you can't connect color wires to each other (I have a cable box).  It literally took me 5 minutes.The one problem I did have was self-inflicted.  After going through set-up, I couldn't get the TV to find my cable channels.  What you have to do is select 'Source' on the remote if you are also hooking up a cable box.  Of course when I called the cable company and spoke w/their Tech Support they offered to send a specialist out for $80/hour.I read about the loud sounds some people were having w/their TV.  No problems here.Hope this helps and enjoy!","Date":"January 30, 2007"}

The TV made it here in great shape and so far, we have not had the 'buzzing' noise that some reviewer's have reported. If you are in the market for a 50\" plasma and are the least bit budget conscious, you won't go wrong with the Samsung.

I have Comcast HD cable hooked up via HDMI, and my Samsung upconvert DVD via the other HDMI.  I gotta tell you they look fantastic.  I realize that the Panasonic overall has better reviews.

{"Title":"Great Value Plasma!","Author":"Todd A. Ebert","ReviewID":"R34J2UMU03HBWQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a lot of research before buying this Samsung plasma.  I was originally leaning toward a Samsung DLP but couldn't resist the plasma form-factor at the great price offered on Amazon.  Sale price at Best Buy was $2199 and I paid $1799 at Amazon with no delivery charge (only took 7 days to arrive in perfect shape).  Pioneer clearly has the best plasmas (per every professional review I read) but I just didn't think it was worth the 50 to 60% price premium.  Panasonic plasmas got good reviews also but not much better than Samsung and I just liked the look of the Samsung unit.As far as the TV itself, it really looks beautiful on the media center, was super easy to setup/program and produces an excellent HD image (using HDMI cable).  The standard digital cable images are OK but in older shows (my kids watch Full House, Brady Bunch, etc.) you can see the pixels and its a bit fuzzy. That is partly due to the fact that we are sitting 9 feet from a 50\" screen and gets better as you move back in the room.  It is easy to get spoiled watching HD shows and its hard to go back to plain old TV.  The bottom line is that this is a great TV at a great price (thru Amazon) and I highly recommend it.","Date":"March 9, 2007"}

Reviews were pretty good for this set from a customer stand point, CNET, for example did not do justice for this TV on their reviews.Any way, after going to several stores, I was lucky enough to end up in CompUSA and seeing this TV set literally side by side between a two Pioneer plasmas, one of them the Elite model, a Panasonic, a Hitachi and a Mitsubishi.All of these great TV's, however, after a lot of watching different media being played, the picture quality of this TV set beat hands down everyone of them and it rivaled the Pioneer Elite, despite the fact that the latter one is 1080p and over $5,000.00! No surpise here, considering the specs.The people from CompUSA were great, so great that they gave me a great deal, $2,299.99 from $2,999.99!I took it home, and on the first day, I accidently tripped with one of the HDMI cables that I had connected to the back of the TV and to my PS3 and I broke that HDMI port. My TV was not detecting it anymore and it was useless.I called Samsung, now I'll admit, that I did not say exactly how things occured, but they did not care how it had happened and within minutes, they confirmed to me that a technician would be coming to my place within 72 hours to repair it for free!Finally, the technician arrived with a new HDMI board, he then replaced it and within 20 minutes he was done! That same evening, Samsung called to find out how my TV was working, if the technician was on time, clean, friendly, etc. Talk about great service! All in all, I am very pleased with the TV and Samung's customer service!","Date":"January 25, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great Picture, but dealing with the buzz","Author":"Karen \"Careful buyer\"","ReviewID":"RLA41XHLRODUR","Overall":"good","Content":"We ordered from Amazon, and all went well (they'll even refund the price difference if it drops within 30 days from delivery).  We have it wall-mounted and hooked up to my husband's old Onkyo surround sound system, which sounds great!  We received it in mid-Sept 2006 and a month later started noticing a buzzing that would get louder as the TV warmed up.  It doesn't bother me much but drives my husband nuts.  You can hear it until you turn the sound up to the mid-20s.  I called customer service and the guy was less than helpful.  Said a buzzing was normal and if the noise level of 18-20 covered it, there was no defect.  And any salesperson or web site should notify customers that this TV has a buzz. (yeah, right!)He said he would send out a service guy, but if no \"defect\" was discovered, we would have to pay the guy's fee.  He couldn't tell us how much it was, just that it was pretty expensive. (This is not my idea of impressive customer service attitude).  We asked to have the service guy call before he came out.  He called 2 days later and said he thought some fan would have to be replaced since he had been doing a lot of those repairs.  After he showed up, he examined the TV and said he could tell there was a factory defect in which the back panels had not been properly welded together and that's what caused the buzz.  So we're getting a new TV under warranty.  I'll let you know if the buzz disappears. Persistence is definitely required in making lots of phone calls to make sure the replacement is approved and delivered.  Some customer service reps were a lot more helpful than others.  Overall, we really love the TV and hope we can get rid of the buzz soon (as opposed to a low hum from the cooling fan, which is a separate thing and not at all a problem).","Date":"January 18, 2007"}

We were debating between this model and the Panasonic 50PX60U. In the store, picture quality looked about the same, the panny may have been a little better, not sure. But, the final deciding points was the Samsung had burn-in protection, better price, and a more pleasing look. So far normal cable channels really aren't bad at all and HDTV is wonderful! The Discovery Channel HD shows have the best picture. If you are going to be 6-8ft away get the 42 inch model save yourself some money but, if your going to be like 9-12ft away get the 50.

I bought this from Amazon, it had the best price I could find, and it also included the free shipping.  My wife even loves the TV.I think I'm like most people, I just want a big TV with a nice picture.  I'm not into all the techie stuff, so I can't comment about all the do-hickies that do or don't connect to it.  All I know is when I plugged it in and connected it to cable, it looks fantastic.  Watching a Hi-Def sporting event on my Samsung is absolutely gorgeous!  The screen is much brigher and the colors more vibrant than my old rear-projection TV.  I mounted mine on the wall and was suprised at how much bigger the room feels vs. having my old rear projection TV.I did a ton of research about plasma and lcd TVs.  My conclusion was, as long as I get a brand that I've heard of the picture would be good enough.  The people that talk about how deep the blacks are and it being just a little warm, and...  These people must have supersonic eyes, 'cause when I went to the local Fry's, they had them all lined up and I couldn't tell the difference AT ALL; and I've had Lasik surgery!  I'd love to bet one of these video nuts whether they could tell the difference.  Cover up the brand and make them pick out which is the more expensive model.  I'll bet they're right only 50% of the time, they would be totally guessing.So, I was very close to buying one of the Vizio TVs.  They have very good reviews on Cnet.  Then I found this on Amazon for only about $200 more.  With the free shipping and no tax, it was almost a wash.  What swayed me to the Samsung and what I like most about the it is the look of the TV around the picture.  It has a high gloss, black piano finish with a very small silver stripe at the bottom.  The silver is not that noticeable because it is recessed and on an angle.  A friend of mine has a 50\" plasma with a silver casing around the picture and I think the black looks much better, especially with the piano finish.  He also agreed with me when he came over to my house.  This TV has the \"Wow\" factor.Bottom Line:  At the price Amazon is selling this for, along with the free shipping; I think this is by far the best deal for the average person looking for a 50\" TV.","Date":"February 2, 2007"}

I researched this for 3 months, looking at Panasonic, Pioneer, etc. at Best Buy.  My friend bought this same unit and he loves it too.  Best Buy has this unit for over $2500 with a bracket ($250) and HDMI cables over $100.  With shipping, you would approach $3k.  I got this TV, a bracket and HDMI cables for about $2100 from Amazon and Eagle delivered in less than a week.  The TV has a boatload of inputs, the remote & menu system are great and this particular unit did not have any buzzing at all... as quiet as can be from the first power-on.

The only rival is Pioneer's Plasma HDTVs in my opinion, but the difference (if any) doesn't justify the price difference. Delivery was good, however I had to coordinate with Eagle for delivery, kind of a pain but not too bad.

{"Title":"Best bang for your buck","Author":"A. Jackman","ReviewID":"R1AUW70KKOS91B","Overall":"good","Content":"I can't say enough about the Samsung 5053 or Amazon.com.  I think that this TV is simply the best choice in the 50\" plasma range.  Sure you could squeeze a little more detail in blacks with the Pioneer, but the extra $800 you're going to spend just isn't worth it.  I also really enjoy pixel shift and whitewash (burn in features)  I think pixel shift really helps to reduce direct line burn ins, and the whitewash does a great job of removing anything that is left behind (I've seen some burn-in left behind from xbox360 as well as anamorphic programming.)  I was very impressed by this model's ability to handle SD programming.  I have my motorola 6400 box from Comcast set to stretch SD 4:3 programming into 16:9, and the Samsung displays it very well.  So long as you are at the proper viewing distance it looks just fine, no quality loss over a standard CRT.  This whole experience of finally buying and HDTV has been great, and my only problems are with the programming available.  We all know that it will be a while before there are a bunch of HD channels available, but until then I just hope that movies stop being released in anamorphic widescreen.  Before the TV came in I DVR'd 4 star wars movies in HD, only to be disappointed to find out that George Lucas apparently thinks that there is a reason to record in anamorphic widescreen.  For those of you who don't know what it is, its a different aspect ratio which will leave you with black bars on the top and bottom of your screen.  Very, very annoying, especially when the plasma is in the break-in period and more susceptible to burn in of the lines.  Anyways that's my little rant on anamorphic programming, but bottom line is this TV is great, I couldn't possibly be more satisfied.  This is clearly the best time to buy plasma to get your use out of it before SED displays become available.","Date":"February 25, 2007"}

The TV is amazing, the picture quality is breath taking.  The set-up is very easy and doesn't take long.... if you have some familiarity with electronics.  As for the buzzing that some people have mentioned, my TV has a slight hum, but it's very faint and is drowned out by the tv volume.  You can hear it when your behind the TV, but again, it is very slight.  To me, I hold an expectation that the TV is going to make some noise while on.... most do.  I also think people hold different tollerances for the noice.... again to me, it's not an issue.  I purchased this TV from Amazon on 02/04/07 for $1959, with free shipping and of course no tax.  The exact same model tv at Best Buy was \"on sale\" for $2659, not including an additional $140 of tax.  Dilevery would be an additional cost as well.  Best Buy or any other big box retailer couldn't touch Amazon's price.  It took me 5 buisness days to receive it, far less than the anticipated dilievery time.  Eagle Dilevery was great, they unpackaged and put the TV on my stand.  Also, this model only rates behind the $4K and up Pioneer Elite plasma lines.  Save your money, the incremental value doesn't match the inflated price tag.  Last, Plasma technology has come along way, and if your on the fence between LCD and Plasma.... Plasma has a better picture quality... especially for sports and movies.","Date":"February 10, 2007"}

{"Title":"Sept 2006 - Mexico Unit, received last week, perfect, no hum","Author":"William F. Carr Jr. \"CARRjr\"","ReviewID":"RMZB9BCEMJ015","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this unit 12/14 expecting delivery after Xmas, then began reading some of the review's and had some concerns about noise, shipping damage, etc.  Well, none of those bad things happened.  I called Eagle Logistics, their driver delivered my unit by working late on a Friday night(7:00PM in the rain) and helped me unbox and power the unit up.  No hum, no damage.I waited a couple of days to type up a review, as I replaced a 30\" LCD with this 50\" plasma and wanted to have some \"experience\" with it before I wrote an opinion.So far my opinion which I formed by looking at the unit at Best Buy mirrors some of the other reviews, the picture quality is only exceeded by the Pioneer unit at 40% more.  With HD cable, I don't think I'll ever need to buy tickets to televised sporting events again.  It's as good as being there.The peerless mount which was recommended worked flawlessly and even though the mount instructions did not have this unit in the guide, a quick call to their customer service line gave me the correct screw/bushing combination to use to guarantee I didn't damage the screen.Very Happy.","Date":"January 10, 2007"}
{"Title":"Excellent product","Author":"Goa Tech","ReviewID":"R273EW3RW7C58Q","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered the TV from Amazon and it arrived in less than 5 working days. One cannot beat the convenience and cost saving (25-30%) of ordering it online. WRT the TV itself, all I can say is wow! I compared this TV to comparable Panasonic, Sony and Pioneer models and I felt this offered excellent quality for the price. In fact I chose this over the Panasonics that were around 10% cheaper as I felt the Samsungs offered a much sharper and realistic image. The Pioneers may have been better, but I felt the difference in quality did not warrant the huge ~30% price difference. The TV also makes design statement and exudes a sense of sophistication with its understated but elegant design. I also did a lot of reading on [...]before making my final decision.I purchased an Oppo 970 upconverting DVD player and am very happy with the combination. One should also add that there is no need to buy the $50-150 Monster HDMI cables. Save your money and buy the $10 cables sold by vendors on Amazon and other places.Finally, I should state that my TV has no buzzing issues. It was a Mexico November 2006 build.","Date":"January 10, 2007"}
{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"Hal9000","ReviewID":"R2BNI9IGEGS7DU","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a lot of research on available 50\" plasmas before buying this one.  I was told the Pioneer was best but looking at the 2 next to each other in BB the Samsung seems to have an edge in sharpness and detail as well as brightness.  You can't beat the 10000:1 contrast ratio on this TV.  Getting it home and hooked up properly I couldn't believe the picture quality for true HD, it is really stunning.  I have seen 1080p pictures and frankly I can't see a whole lot of difference with this set.  Live HD feeds (like football) really look unbelievable and people coming over to watch a game are stunned.  Standard def and digital pictures vary in quality (some look great, some not so great) but you will have that with any TV this size.  I run 1080p dvd's and they look phenomenal. Also has great burn-in protection options to ease your mind and lot's of flexibility for displaying 4:3 pictures (crop, stretch, etc)Cons - the sound system could be better (sounds very tinny).  I think this TV is really designed with a surround sound system in mind. . The remote could be set up a little bit better but is better than my Yamaha receiver's remote (which is awful).Overall, a great deal with the new, lowered price especially.  Comes with a 2 year warranty and you can get an additional 3 yr extension for about $150 form 3rd party warranty companies on the web (5 yrs total).","Date":"January 9, 2007"}

Debated between this and the comparable Panasonic, and to be honest, I chose this black model over Panasonic's silver. Sharp, deep colors were very important to me along with wide viewing angles. This TV delivers! The lack of 1080p was a slight drawback, but I personally didn't see the value in having it. Probably only downside is that the sound put out by this unit's internal speakers is somewhat weak. But if you're buying an HD TV, you darn sure better be connecting to an audio receiver! The non-HD channels look better on this unit than other similar TVs I've seen and it naturally stretches those channels to fit the screen. The TV is one month old as of this writing, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Very good value for this TV.","Date":"May 3, 2007"}

The picutre is great and even the built in sound surround technology they have to simulate 5.1 surround is cool.If you buy a HDTV like this then you obviously want to experience television, movies and great sound so get yourself the Samsung Home Theater system w/DVD and plug it in - you will be totally blown away by the sound and for $309.00 you just can't get a better home theater sound system for your new Samsung HDTV.  (See Samsung Home Theater Systems 1000w)I originally planned to mount this unit on the wall but I quickly realized that with all the cables that have to be ran to hook up your DVR, Sound System, Xbox, Etc that I would have to route the cables up through the wall.  Unless you have your wall wired for running AV cables from the bottom of the wall where you components are and up to the top where you HDTV is mounted, you will be cursing the gods of home theater! <grin>[...]Overall this unit has met all my expectations and then some.  It has plenty of ports for connectivity and two HDMI ports.  HDMI is the best way to ensure you have a digital connection from your Cable Box to your Monitor and the same for your Home Theater / DVR system.  You can use component cables too but the picture is definitely better with the HDMI cables.Also, I would recommend you order the Optical Audio Cable for connecting a sound system to the HDTV monitor.[...]Two Thumbs Up!","Date":"March 31, 2007"}

Arrived on time and in good shape via Eagle.  Gorgeous TV, great picture.  Mine does buzz slightly as I am told all plasmas do to a certain degree.  Samsung's are more prone to this vs other brands.  The buzzing is my only complaint, but its so faint that over time it becomes unoticable.  From my research, the noise is coming from the plasma jets that shoot the electrons into  the gas, generating the picture.  Samsung even puts a caveat in the owner manual that this TV will not run silently and a slight buzzing sound is considered normal. Again, thats my only gripe about it.  Im sure you can go spend $5,000 on a Pioneer that runs quieter, but thats too much money for a freakin TV in my opinion. You get what you pay for in this case.........","Date":"January 29, 2007"}

It was very easy to get started and with little fuss, the picture was awesome, even with only standard def cable. Like other reviewers, I was concerned when I read about the audible buzzing noise.  I thought I would take a chance anyway, because the price was pretty much too hard to beat.  Well, the buzz was there right from the start and still is a constant annoyance.  The TV was on and I was coming upstairs from my basement, I actually thought my fiance was shaving on the floor above the tv; seriously, it is that loud. Even at high volume, it is still very noticable and extremely annoying. Needless to say, we did call Samsung and they will be sending someone out to look at the tv next week.I do know 2 others who have the 42-inch Samsung and there is no buzz at all with their tv's.I should also note that we are using the stand on a tv table, and it is about 1 foot from the wall.  We do not have a surround sound system or any other speaker system hooked up yet so we are only using the built in speakers. (I read somewhere that the buzz could be b/c it is to close to a wall???)Aside from the buzzing, I am extremely satisfied with the TV.  It's sleek and classy, and I can't wait to get it hung above my fireplace. Colors are so vibrant and even skin color on this plasma is pretty close to looking normal. (I did compare this model at several stores before buying, to make sure that people were not going to look alien or badly sunburnt!)

{"Title":"The best plasma!  Just make sure you have all the right stuff","Author":"Dmitry Glozman","ReviewID":"R1557D4MVITBEE","Overall":"good","Content":"Excellent TV! After doing a lot of research and comparison I decided to go with Samsung 5053 model and I'm really happy with my decision.No buzzing sound of any kind. My TV was made on 10/2006 on Mexico. I think the major mistake people do is not buying extra stuff that are really necessary.First, if you spend $2000+ on TV, please invest a little more into HDMI cable (can be bought for $15, and there is no need for Monster HDMI brand that cost $90+).I compared them (Monster and other no brand cable) and there is NO difference what so ever.Second, you need to get a High Definition receiver from your cable/dish company that have an HDMI output. I have Cablevision and I got DVR box with HDMI output from them. If you want to see high resolution picture you MUST get a High Definition receiver otherwise you will not get the same picture you see in the store.Actually you will get a BETTER picture then in the store because most of the stores do not use HDMI cables.And the last thing THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE since the biggest problem for most of the people in reviews below is BUZZING sound, is to get a noise reducer / surge protector.This thing is a MUST HAVE, if you do not want to have buzzing problems like many people have. I got Belkin PureAV 10 Outlet Isolator, but there are other brands available like Monster. It DOES reduce any unnecessary noise and IMPROVE your picture and sound. In this case I would recommend to spend a little extra and get a good quality isolator instead of the unknown brand model since it does make a difference (unlike HDMI cable)Also make sure your cable is also connected to Isolator first before it goes to TV.All I can say that I have a BETTER picture that most of the stores have, and HDTV channels are breathtaking! I just wish my cable company provided more channels in high resolution. One thing that stand Samsung apart from most of the other plasma brands is the quality of Analog channels. On my TV they look even BETTER then on regular CRT TVs! The only difference since they are displayed in 16:9 format, the picture is a little wider then normal but it is barely noticeable.Also make sure you set up you cable box properly, so it would up convert all 1080i signals when you switch to HDTV channel and go back to 480i when you switch to Analog channels. This way you will not have to constantly change setting in order to get rid of side bars that all Analog channels have when viewed on 16:9 format TV.I'm not sure how it is done with other cable providers but in Cablevision it is really simple: you just make only 1080i and 480i formats available and for picture format option choose \"Auto DVI/HDMI\"Also you might want to get something like \"The AVIA Guide to Home Theater DVD\" (sold here on Amazon for $39). It will help you to calibrate your picture settings. I did not purchase it since I think that my picture is already amazing, but I know few people who did and it help them significantly improve their picture (contrast, color, sharpness, etc).So overall I'm very happy with this TV an I do not think there are anything better available within this price range and even Pioneer Elite (for around $6000) is not noticeably better.","Date":"January 30, 2007"}

I was connected to \"Tier One\" support, this level of support is for someone who is to lazy to read the owners manual, They couldn't resolve the remote issue so they put me through to \"Tier Two\" support who told me the remote didn't have a `code search\" option and if the codes I had don't work than it's not going to work go get a universal remote which is what I thought I had.

{"Title":"Bang for the buck is definitely with this one","Author":"Jonathan Taylor","ReviewID":"R10O6825GSA2RI","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this model in June from a local appliance store.  I did lots of shopping... well over 4 weeks of going to stores and playing with the settings in a lot of them; and there are a couple of issues to be aware of.  One is that when you are using the 4:3 mode on the TV to view 4:3 content the sidebars are silver... which is annoying and cant be changed... HOWEVER, if you use an HD-upconverter type DVD player with HDMI that goes away since aspect is changed by the DVD player.  The other issue is that its only 1080i, which frankly is not a big deal, especially considering most HDTV this large under $5000 are as well.  I was borrowing a 42\" 3rd generation Dell plasma with about a 4000:1 contrast ratio from my company while i was shopping, and was really unhappy with the muddiness of darker onscreen areas of that tv, but I have to say this one looks GREAT.  You can notice some muddiness if you have your contrast set too low and the picture quality of the DVD is poorly lit, buuuut honestly I keep mine set around 55% and it looks awesome.  Of course with a plasma you dont want the contrast set to high if you want it to last longer and always avoid falling asleep to a dvd menu if you want to avoid burn in, but if you accidentally fall asleep (i did), it comes with a burn in erasing rolling pattern which is a really big comfort to the mind.  Not to mention its a very sexy piece of furniture when not on.  I can't speak for its sound system, because if you are spending 3 grand on a tv, you really should have a nice sound system and mute the tv anyway.  I would recommend buying a plasma from a local appliance store for quite a few reasons... but chief among them people on here seem to be getting them smashed in transit frequently, which a local store is not going to let happen, and if it DID happen, you would avoid the nightmare I'm sure that has got to be.  The only TV I saw that compared to this one was a Panasonic that was running over $1500 more expensive, and it did look nicer... but only about 100 dollars nicer.  Of course there is a certain subjectivity to this, but if you read about non-defeatable DNIE or whatever and are nervous about this set, simply go out to somewhere they have them and play with the features and settings.  The people that complain about this seem to not be going through the options.  All you have to do is see it side by side with about any other plasma and it'll win you over.","Date":"October 4, 2006"}

The other one is a 56\" DLP which is beautiful to watch and simply to look at.  Having been spoiled by big screen, I got this for my dad who watches mostly analog satellite programming.  Which means no HD.  Which is why I didn't pick an 1080P enabled TV and got this one instead.The quick white-glove delivery is great.  Package came, carried, opened for me with courtesy and professionalism.the TV is plug and play and analog TV looks a lot better than I had expected on this TV.  So far he's been very satisfied with it and I have not noticed any loud humming noise aside from the very low decible fan noise.I plan to purchase more Samsung TVs in the future as their quality is simply awesome.

{"Title":"Best plasma at this price right now","Author":"Robert E. Huebner \"early adopter\"","ReviewID":"RBPZKPZ97IC57","Overall":"good","Content":"I was an early adopter of Plasma technology and have owned a Pioneer 50\" Plasma as my main display for a few years now.  I love Plasma in general, so decided, now that prices are coming down from the stratosphere, to get a second plasma set for a bedroom TV.  All I can say is things have really come a long way!  Early plasmas had problems displaying detail in dark scenes, but new models such as this Samsung have come much closer to solving this problem.I auditioned dozens of sets at multiple dealerships and did a lot of side-by-side comparisons and adjustments, and determined that these newest Samsung sets represent the best blend of performance, quality, and cost.  My requirements were to have at least 2 HDMI slots, since this is the future for high-definition connectivity, be 37\" or 42\" in size, and have the best quality picture I could afford.A lot of on-line advice pointed to the Panasonic as the one to get so I went into this fully expecting to end up with a Panny, but after much side-by-side between the Samsung 4253 and the newest Panasonics, there was no contest - the Samsung has more natural looking color gradiations, the Panasonic looked odd and banded in appearance.  I verified this at multiple vendors and side-by-side.Be careful however not to get re-directed to the previous generation Samsung models, many of which are still on the market and sold as new.  Samsung seems to be replacing their lined up with these newer sets in a graudal manner.  At least two other 42\" models ending in \"2\" instead of \"3\" can be found at various retailers.  To me, these older sets did not measure up to the visual fidelity in the \"3\" series.  Over time I'm sure Samsung will make \"3\" versions of their other sets, so if you need one with a CableCard tuner or something, I'd wait a while.  Also I wish this set had more stretch options for dealing with 4:3 inputs.  The only options for HD signals are 16:9 or 4:3 with bars, neither of which helps deal with HD signals that are letterboxed AND 4:3 (common for cable boxes that up-convert letterbox SDTV material).  I'm not sure which sets do have these stretch modes, but I beleive some do.Also, Plasmas are moving very fast right now, with Pioneer due to release new models any day, among others.  Waiting a bit longer if you're in no hurry may turn up a set even better than this at the same price.  But as of Spring 2006, I am very confident this is the best 42\" plasma in the ~$2k range.","Date":"June 4, 2006"}
{"Title":"Nice TV but has glitches","Author":"Kevin Mccarthy Jr. \"kmccarthy\"","ReviewID":"R3HLZ24NTBEM1H","Overall":"good","Content":"After spending 6 months researching HDTVs I got this Tv over Memorial Day weekend from Amazon for a great deal, $1899.99.  No shipping and no tax can't beat the price for one of the better plasmas on the market.But there are a couple of issues with this tv.  Don't buy it over the panasonic because of its PIP option.  The PIP can only be used when a HDMI tv feed is on or another hookup besides componenet for television viewing.  This leads to the other problem.There is a glitch with the HDMI.  So if you are utilizing the AV ports for a playstation or DVD player the tv can't understand which source to pick.  So if you are watching tv,  But then want to watch a DVD you can change the source to the DVD player (the AV input) but when the movie is done you can't switch back to the HDMI input.  The tv no longer recognizes the connection.  This was a great pain for me.  I purchased a HDMI/DVI wire for my cable box.  And the first time a changed the source to the AV for my playstation and I was able to play it but when I was done the HDMI feed was no longer an option.  So I spent the next day and a half going through my connections and calling the cable company which told me to contact my tv manufacturer.  Samsung said that the tv has a glitch and the tv must be reset (there is no mention of how to reset the tv in the owner manual).  So now  everytime a change the source to the av port I must reset the tv whcih consists of unplugging the tv waiting 30 seconds, hitting the power button on the tv itself 10 times, plugging the tv back in, turning the tv on and switching the source.This problem doesn't occur if your cable is hooked up via component and the picture is basically as good as the HDMI feed(I will proably switch it back to component once a get over that a spent $100 on a Monster DVI to HDMI cable and won't use it.Other than that te tv is great.  It has a much better appearance over the panasonic.  HDTV is awesome.  SD is ok; comes in better for some some stations than oters.  Speakers are above average.  Overall this is a very impressive tv if you can get beyond the glitch.  Sports are amazing feels like you are there, nature shows are extremely impressive.  The TV has great colors and true blacks.","Date":"June 29, 2006"}
{"Title":"one sexy plasma","Author":"D. Babiy","ReviewID":"R2PBWRWSQCXS0X","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a bunch of comparison shopping before I settled on this one. In this price range it was down to 3 plasmas, the Panasonic TH-42PX60U, Hitachi 42HDS69 and this Samsung HP-S4253. I did my research online, and there are plenty of people praising all the models, each with their own issues. Apparently the Panasonic has \"clay-face\", Hitachi has a green push, and this Samsung is a \"buzzer\". I went to best buy and circuit city to take a look for myself. Each store I went into I felt differently... because stores don't calibrate the monitors they get and I was seeing different results. Customers play around with the image settings, leave it looking crappy, and others judge the TV based on what they see without checking settings. Anyway, after I played around with the settings of the all the TV's... I did notice the Hitachi's green push which bothered me enough to take it off the list. Now the Panasonic does have a great picture but the case (matte silver with matte black frame) just makes it look a bit cheap and not as slick as the Samsung. The Samsung with its shiny black finish looks much richer in my point of view. Since picture quality is great on both monitors the only things that was worrying me is to get a \"buzzer\" which quite a few people complained on forums about. Its natural for all plasmas to buzz a little bit when your ear is 1-2 ft away. But some say they get buzzing sitting on the couch. I decided to take the chance and made sure when delivery came, I took it out and turned it on before I signed for it with the deliver guy. If it was going to buzz loudly I was planning on simply declining it, but luckily I got a good one.Now I must say I don't know how SD quality picture compares between the Samsung and the Panasonic since I don't have them side by side and in store they were all showing HD pictures... but I have to say that SOME SD channels on my Samsung look crappy while majority of the others are perfectly fine, it really depends on the quality of the broadcast. I watch mostly HD and DVDs so i'm fine.Regarding burn-ins... all plasmas suffer from this, so just try not to watch anything with black bars on the side for too long... and its also recommended that for the first 100 hours you \"Break in\" your TV by watching things with picture settings at no more then 50... which is a bit dull, but I'm willing to deal with it for a bit if it prolongs the life of the set in the long run.Also if you want to calibrate the monitor yourself you can get the AVIA dvd calibration... or you can try the settings I got.DNIE - Turn it off (it makes the blacks way too black and you loose shadow detail)Contrast - 80Brightness - 67Sharpness - 20Color - 50 (I don't have the color filters to properly adjust this, but it looks great to me so I left it at 50)Color Temp - Cool 1 (the warmer temps make things a bit too orangey for me, just pay attention to whites when changing this)","Date":"November 16, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great buy, better than last year's model's","Author":"Chris Caspen \"HDTV\"","ReviewID":"R2Z9EEVUR4IEL7","Overall":"good","Content":"The Samsung HP-S4253 42\" Plasma HDTV is definately a step up in all areas from it's previous Samsung plasma TV models.  It's able to produce a 536 Billion color gamut.  This sounds like a big number, and it is, but just for comparison an LCD generally produces about a 6 million color gamut (some are higher and some are lower) yes that's million and not billion.  A single chip DLP projection TV will produce even less then that.  However, 536 billion is not a huge number when compared to other plasma TVs, infact it typical of most Plasma TVs (Another reason for Plasma over LCD).  The 10000:1 contrast ratio is one reason this gamut is possible on a plasma.The Samsung HP-S4253 42\" Plasma HDTV features two High-Definition-Multimedia-Interface inputs which is ideal for your next generation DVD players, your HDTV source (satalite/cable), or your 7.1 surround sound system.  2 inputs are better than 1 epecially when it comes to HDMI, where an HDMI splitter retails for over $100.  The television also is equipped with a built in ATSC-tuner so you'll be ready for free over-the-air High definition or digital broadcasts.  The television looks brilliant from both a graphical stand point and also an aesthetic one.  The HP-S4253 looks beautiful with a sleek piano black finish which can easily be mounted on a wall or set on any suitable surface.  It has to be one of the most aesthetically pleasing plasma's on the market, as long as you keep it dust free as it seems that dust is more noticable on this television than others.","Date":"May 22, 2006"}
{"Title":"DID THE COMPETITION WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS?","Author":"Alexander J. Graham \"Grahamboat\"","ReviewID":"R202XXEKD96JS6","Overall":"good","Content":"If you are reading these reviews you are probably considering buying a Samsung HP-S4253 from Amazon. Three weeks before I purchased this set I read all of these reviews as well as reviews from other sites. While the majority of all reviews were positive there were enough negative comments to make me pause. I have always suspected that many \"consumer reviews\" are written by the representatives of both the manufacturer and the competition, so I take all reviews with a grain of salt. The following is a synopsis of my experience.Even though I have purchased many expensive items from Amazon, I still had some hesitation in ordering an HDTV on-line, but a $400 savings over any \"Big Box Store\" gave me the courage to give it a try. I chose Standard Delivery a.k.a. free shipping. The set arrived 10 days after I placed my order. It was delivered by two men from the freight company who carried it up my stairs and set it up on my stand and removed the boxes from my house. I always tip these guys as they go beyond what's required.The cable company was coming the next day to hookup a high definition set top box, but I wanted to see how it looked with just digital cable, so I hooked it up with the plain A/V cable. The setup was easy, mostly automatic. The picture and sound were truly magnificent.The cable guy, sorry I couldn't resist, came the next day and installed an Atlanta Scientific Explorer 8000 set top box, a DVR with 80 hours of record time and HDMI connections. As I wanted a better DVD to go with my new TV, I also order a Samsung DVD-VR335 form Amazon. This unit is a combination DVD player/recorder plus VCR which has the ability to upscale DVD's when hooked up with a HDMI cable. HDMI cables are the best and easiest way to hookup any HDTV. They simply plug in and carry both the audio and video signals. Because a digital signal is either on or off, I believe you don't have to have the most expensive HDMI cables for great results. So I have a HDMI hookup from the set top box to HDMI #1 on the TV and a HDMI hookup from the DVD player to HDMI #2 on the TV. These connections work flawlessly and couldn't be easier to install.This TV looks great right out of the box, the color is the best I've seen, the definition is superb and the sound is excellent for any stand alone system. If you see this set in any store where the picture doesn't seem better than others in this price range, keep in mind that the store can detune the Samsung if they wish to push another brand. Other negative review comments such as buzzing are probably due to improper cable hookups. The issue of watching standard television on a wide screen high definition television is a compromise. The Samsung HP-S4253 handles this compromise better than most as it gives you four options, Standard (faces become a tad stretched), zoom1 ( great picture but cuts off the bottom and top), zoom2 (also good but I prefer zoom1), or 3:4 ( shows the same picture that you are use to in a letterbox - be careful of burn in during the 1st 100 hours). A click of the remote button allows you to cycle though all formats. Believe me you will enjoy watching standard TV on this set as the picture is so much clearer and the color is more natural.My conclusion is that this is a great set at an outstanding price and you can't go wrong with it. My only minor complaint is that I am back to having to use three remotes to take advantage of all the options I now have. Normally I just use the set top box remote for most of my viewing.","Date":"November 22, 2006"}

The legs \"swing and lock\" into place in the Sam's version. I didnt like the dome shape stand on the retail version (S4253).Anyway, let's get down to the performance. I install Plasmas all the time. I install the Mitsubishi Diamond, and Medallion series plasmas (1080P), I have also installed the High end JVC 1080P LCD's too. And all kinds of in between brands. After coming home and looking at my $200 sear's APEX CRT tv, I thought it was time to take the plunge into HDTV. EXCEPT I am not going to pay $5000+ for a TV. Not even $4000. SO I started the tedious process of looking for a HDTV.If you are reading this then you are probably on the hunt for an HDTV. Let me tell you right up front, you have probably seen the best Plasma TV locally (or at a friends) already and no amount of homework, forum trolling is going to make the decision easier.  If you buy a Plasma made in 2006, they are all virtually equal in comparison. I am talking of major brand names, not generic off-name brands like visio, Ilo, etc etc.I cannot tell a difference between this Tv and the $5750 50\" Mitsubishi Plasma I just installed last week. Here is an important note: It all comes down to signal quality. Get yourself a good Updated cable set top box with HDMI out. Now get yourself the OPPO DVD player (here at Amazon of course) and you have yourself an HDTV experience waiting for you!!The price is 25% less than what I paid now at Amazon, so add it to your cart. DO not let the price make you think there is something wrong with this TV Just because it doesnt cost $2000-$5000. There is a real price war going on, and Samsung is going to come out on top.This TV has all the hookups you need: 2HDMI, 3Component, plenty plenty. The Tv makes no buzzing sound. It has no hangups at all. The DNIE feature is cool, it makes the image even better. And now a word about standard definition: I kept hearing about standard def tv not looking good on some HDTV's. This one is amazing on SDTV!! The kids were amzed at Spongebob, and my wife loves to watch her Lifetime channel in SD now. I wish I could have saved the money, but thats how it goes. Any TV you buy is going to drop in price Very SOON after you plug it in, so go ahead and get over it now.ESPN in High definition is awesome!!! Oh by the way, get a decent Over the air antenna and you will be surprised at the amount of free tv stations that are passing right over your house!!!I would buy this TV again in a heartbeat.","Date":"October 20, 2006"}

I was originally planning on purchasing the Panasonic 42 inch plasma( I have many Panasonic products and they have all been incredible, TV's, DVD player, receivers, etc)However after waiting in line from 4am I was one of the many unlucky people that couldn't get one.I starting talking to the manager and he said that this BestBuy only is selling the Samsung 42 today only for $1,199. Originally $1700+This TV is replacing the 26in HD Samsung tube TV in my living room. I have brought home at 5 tv's previous to this one before my wife said that picture looks good.1-Winbook LCD- Junk2-HP LCD-Junk3-Syntax or something- waste of time4-Polaroid-Stick with making cameras5- Samsung DLP- Pixels galore with standard cable.So finally I set this up, tune in HD and it looks great!!  Now the true test. I changed the station to a regular cable channel in standard definition and it looked good. I got the stamp of approval finally.Sorry for the long details, but it took a long time to finally get a new tv for the living room.  Here are some additional comments:-I was told and also read that for the first month or two watch the plasma in either movie mode or standard-NEVER Dynamic mode. Reason why you are training the tv with bright colors off the bat, you should work it in slowly. Standard is nicer than movie mode in my opinion.HD broadcast looks great- Don't worry about burn it(dont go crazy) Samsung as a built in pixel mover that adjust the pixels every 2 minutes. This is seamless to the person watching. Also they have some built in tools that in the case that you do get \"image retention\" you can run these utilities and they can correct them.SD broadcast is nice- much better than some tv's I have seen. I recommend being at least 7 feet away from this tv for optimal quality. Honestly, even from 2 feet I didnt see an pixelation.Gaming- There is a game mode that you can turn on for the input you use for games. They look great regardless of the input.DVD- Awesome through component inputs and S video.Audio- You can customize these setting. If you turn on the special sound T-something, it echos sometimes. I have adjusted mine and it is perfect. I have a home theater in the basement so I only use the tv speakers for this Samsung.Overall- The design is beautiful, it's a technical piece of furniture. The tv is about 90 pounds so it is heavier than some LCDs. If you are looking for a Plasma TV in the $1200-$1700, this is the best overall bet.","Date":"December 8, 2006"}

I spent about 3 months researching and comparing plasmas and lcd tv's before I bought this one.  I had decided on buying a Lcd a couple of weeks ago.  My friend when out and bought a sony bravia 40in lcd 2 days before I was going to buy the same television.  I am really gald I didn't.  His STD picture off of Direct TV is terrible.  According to Sony that is as good as it will get until all of Direct TV is completly HD, and who knows how long that will be.  Then I started researching all over again, going to best buy and watching all of the tvs, sharp, sony, lg, panasonic, and samsung, with HD channels with out HD.  I could not tell any difference between the samsung, panasionic, and lg televisions in HD.  The sony was 2nd and the sharp 3rd.  The plasmas were much better in STD.  So at that point I focused on just the plasmas.  The blacks are much better, the picture is sharper, and the fast actions programing is much, much better with a plasma.  To make a long story short I chose the samsung because of price ($800) less than a pioneer.  Burn in protection that the panasionic doesn't have, and just a better look of the TV case compared to the LG.  And the samsung has PIP.  Since I had the TV for the past week I can not complain about the picutre, it is totally fantastic on HD, and very good on the STD chanels.  The sound is better than average for 2 speekers.  the easy of use is also great.  My father who is an electronic moron could set this up and use the tv.  The tuners also bring in channels over antenna that I never new were avaible.  The antenna HD chanells are excellent, the STD channels are so, so.  Stick to cable or satellite for STD channels.  My only dislike it the PIP is not actaully PIP.  It is more like a dual monitior.  You have to have to different sources connected for the PIP to work.  And then they both cannot be coaxel.  So the PIP is knid of a joke.  But if you want a 42in plasma for a heck of a good price with a awesome picture, that is simple to use, pick the samsung you will not be disappointed.  By the way I don't know what all the fuss is about the buzzing my doesn't buzz.","Date":"November 29, 2006"}

TV is great, looks amazing, but I think everyone here has a right to know about the terrible service offered by Electronics Expo. Read on for my whole tragic order process.They took my order, took my money from my checking account, and then one day later I received an email saying that my order had been cancelled. I called them up and some guy told me that they did not have anymore of these TVs left and they over estimated the amount they had in stock (??????????). So I requested my money back and he said they could not refund me and I would simply have to wait around until they get more TVs in!! (which was another \"couple of weeks\") Total nightmare!! I wanted to just go buy this TV somewhere else but they forced me to buy through them despite the fact that they DID not have any of the requested item in stock!!!!Customer service was rude and inconsistent in all of their responses! I called back later that day and asked for a manager and got on the phone with a surprisingly nice woman. She told me that they actually had 6 TVs left in stock and that one of them was mine and would be shipped out. So the person I talked to before had just cancelled my order in error for whatever reason. I got another email saying my order wasn't cancelled. Then I got ANOTHER email saying my order was cancelled AGAIN (from the same idiot I am guessing). I called back and they said that email was for someone else and not meant for me (????). So then my order shipped out three days later (I only know because I called them) via some 3rd party shipping company. No tracking number, no insurance, nothing. Just the rep at EE said, yes it shipped. Guess what happened?The next day I wake up to a phone call at 8am and its some guy saying he wants to deliver my TV this afternoon at 5-6pm, I say great! I sit around my house until 9pm and receive no phone call, no email, nothing. Guy shows up at 9:45, no apology, nothing said. Fine, whatever, just give me my TV. Turns out, its some older guy and his poor PREGNANT wife. U serious? This company sends out one guy and a pregnant woman to deliver a 1500 dollar, 100+ Lbs plasma TV???? I couldnt stand by and watch her try to carry it up the stairs so I just did her job for her. What kind of shipping company would do this????? I get upstairs and then the delivery guy just wants me to sign so he can leave. Uh...no, we are going to set up the TV and turn it on to well, you know, make sure it actually WORKS ok. He says \"I don't know how to..\"  WHAT?? Ok, whatever, I will just do it. \"No you cannot, company policy\". PFFT I dont care, I paid over a thousand dollars for this thing. Im unpacking it. So I UNPACK, SET UP, AND TURN ON. Something that the delivery company SHOULD have done.End result, TV worked fine. Its a great TV for the price but DO NOT order if it is being sold through Electronics Expo, they are the worst online sellers I have ever come across.","Date":"April 4, 2007"}

So I figured that by the time they make LCD better (and cheaper) I might be ready for a new screen, but until then I'm very happy with this one!And it looks so cool mounted on the wall!!!!","Date":"November 9, 2006"}
{"Title":"Outstanding!","Author":"RMS \"RMS\"","ReviewID":"RYYEGH69VSEG3","Overall":"good","Content":"By far, the best electronic purchase I made this year.  I am thrilled with the Samsung.  After months of research, mostly due to display technology, I went with this manufacturer.  As for the comparison to HDTV delivered from tube sets', there is no challenge.  Often, when I what's new become the norm, I flip between the analog and digital HD version of the same broadcasted event, say a nature program.  The difference is outstanding.  If I had only one CON, it would be this: \"This, as with all plasma TVs, runs hot\".  That is, where a normal tube set, up to about 37\" operates using roughly 120-watts of electricity, this set consumes hefty 320-watts of power.  This result produces an exponential increase in the amount of heat emitted from these sets.  That is, about three-times more than what comes from a CRT(TUBE)TV set.  The slight cost increase for electricity is a small price to pay for unparalleled clarity and definition.  Another way of looking at it is that a plasma set can serve double-duty.  No more cold winter nights!  Lastly, don't waste your money on expensive HDMI cables.  Having the cable TV technician on-site, I tried both the HDMI and component forms of hook-up.  Component was the clear winner.  According to the \"cable guy\" 85% of all HD TVs he installs, produces the same results I found.  Save the HDMI connections (two of them on this set) for the new Sony PS3 or XBOX 360.","Date":"November 6, 2006"}

{"Title":"Yet another glowing review of this great TV!","Author":"Colin Cushing","ReviewID":"R2XQSNE1HO6YRQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV last spring and wanted to wait a few months before reviewing. My review after a week would have been 5/5 and today it would be 6/5 if I could give it that. I did a lot of research and comparing with other sets and confidently chose this Samsung. I'm convinced I made the right decision.Delivery: I was not home when the TV was delivered but regardless, setup was very easy. The set came assembled on the stand in the box, so it was just a matter of opening the box and lifting it into place. You might be able to move it into place on your own but it would be risky and I wouldn't recommend it. With 2 people it was no problem.Picture: I am still amazed by the picture quality and continue to annoy my wife whenever I see an especially nice image (\"Look at how great this looks!!\"  \"Yes dear I know, you've shown me 1,000 great images. It's very nice. I get it.\"). HD channels, especially Discovery and ESPN, border on ridiculous they look so good. Non-HD channels don't look fantastic but that's not the TV's fault.Sound: Very good for a TV. If I have the TV volume up and the volume on my speakers up I get an echo effect so I use speakers-only while my wife prefers TV-only. The echo effect is likely due to something I've done wrong in setup but I haven't really investigated thoroughly since I'm OK with only using one or the other (TV or speakers). I haven't experienced any of the hissing noises that other reviewers mention.Size: for an average TV room, I would not recommend getting a TV any larger than 42\". It is obviously quite noticeable but doesn't take over the room or look ridiculous. Any bigger would start to look imposing and silly, in my opinionAesthetics: probably more of a personal preference issue than any other aspect, but I think the color (all black) and the overall shape and lines combine for a very sleek looking unit that would look great in any room.Price: I thought it was a decent deal when I bought it for $1,999 (April 2006). I see now that the price has dropped considerably which makes buying this TV a no-brainer. I will definitely be buying another one when we get a bigger place and have the room for it.Do I need to recap? Great TV!","Date":"January 16, 2007"}
{"Title":"Excellent TV for the price","Author":"peter campanella \"jack\"","ReviewID":"RB2RYM9LZ0VW1","Overall":"good","Content":"After 9 months of research I found that the Samsung HP-S 4253 plasma out-performs all other plasma televisions on the market other than your hi-end televisions such as JVC and Bang and Olufsen.  I believe this is the best plasma on the market for the price.  The reviews are true about the sound, from this plasma it is not the best, but that is what makes this TV affordable.  One of the reasons why the Panasonic is more expensive is basically the sound system.  The Hi-definition is absolutely unbelievably lifelike.  Be sure to purchase an HDMI DVD/VCR player for the full effect of Hi-def on DVD's.  Though I have found that if something was not filmed in Hi-Def, it exhibits a large amount of contrast, which I cannot find how to reduce. (like Seinfeld dvd's.)I found that the inputs on the Samsung are enough for me.  Even though I would have liked the sd card slot offered on the Panasonic, it is not the reason why you would buy a television.  After finally seeing the Panasonic, Samsung and Pioneer next to each other at Circuit city, it is more than obvious that this Samsung has the greatest amounts of color and brightness.  I do wish there was a DVI port but its easy enough to buy an adapter for your computer.  It does come with a VGA port, which I guess is good enough.The one thing I found to be a bit disappointing is the fact that you cannot use the picture in picture function with other TV channels (broadcasts) if you are using HDMI or component cables.  PIP ONLY seems to work between watching HDMI and Component.  It does not work between Component and Component (meaning 2 sports games at once).  Kind-of a minus for me, can't watch the Yankees and the Giants at one time!!! BUT if you have your cable hooked up via coaxle you can achieve \"broadcast\" PIP, but there goes your Hi-Def.  (by the way the Panasonic does not come with PIP).I believe the design is exceptional, the glossy black border is new to this 5th generation and it really compliments my living room. The design is very modern compared to most other flat screen TV's.  I also had a horizontal space limitation which completely cancelled out the Panasonic and the Phillips. Be sure NOT to purchase the Samsung HP-S4252, the \"2\" is last years model, easy to tell the border is not glossy. I still do not understand why Samsung did not incorporate a swivel in the stand.  The new LCD TV's that came out at the same time and have a swivel. Very odd???Packaging, is very compact, and very easy to carry and take out of the box.  It is Samsungs, \"lift-up\" design.  I got the TV for $1,700 at PC Richards, I did not like Amazon's policy of once it is received that is it you cannot return it...... I wanted to see the TV and make sure there were no imperfections, they also plugged it in and tested it out for me.  Remember PC Richards is not a corporation, they HAGGLE.  Best Buy and Circuit city will not budge with prices.  I also purchased the 5 year warranty, which I highly recommend.Overall I have found so far that the Samsung is an excellent television, it gives off a lot of heat, typical with all plasmas, but other than that I have not had much of any disappointments in my viewing experiences.  This television was well worth the money and I would recommend this to anyone in the market looking for a flat screen television!!!","Date":"September 25, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great Plasma which has exceeded expectations","Author":"Jeffrey A. Sindewald \"Bears fan\"","ReviewID":"R30GARE9TTVY8S","Overall":"good","Content":"In November 2006 I purchased the Samsung HP-S4253 Plasma TV from Amazon and what a great purchase it has been. I decided to wait a couple of months to write a review. I didn't want to give a out of the box initial reaction and wanted to get some time under with the television before sharing my thoughts.  Here they are:PICTURE QUALITYThe picture quality on this television is outstanding.  We receive television signal through Cable TV.  I have a HD cable box with both Component Video and HDMI.  Both hook ups look great really.  HDMI is how we have the Samsung hooked up now and don't see a reason to change.  The colors are very bright and vibrant.  I would say that before we bought the TV off of Amazon.com, I was at Circuit City several times looking at the Samsung and judging picture quality.  The HP-S4253 picture in Circuit City was good enough to buy the TV but in reality is fantastic when you get it in your home.  Standard Def TV channels through our cable box is fine. I have read other reviews which questioned the quality of the picture on standard def channels and I disagree.GAMINGFor a short period of time, we had a XBOX 360 hooked up to the HP-S4253 and the picture was spectacular.  Its a better picture than our 50\" Samsung DLP we have the XBOX 360 hooked up to.DVDWe have a 480P DVD player hooked up via component video cables. Picture is very good.  Once again vibrant bright colors make movie watching a joy.SHIPPING FROM AMAZONThis was an area that exceeded my expectations.  I have to admit I was a little nervous shipping this TV from their warehouse.  I had never shipped a TV before.  Usually, I have picked my TV's up at a local store and brought them home myself.  Well shipping a plasma TV via over the road truck service is no big deal.  Amazon customer service was extremely helpful and Eagle trucking customer service was great as well.  Drivers unpacked the Plasma and put the box in the garage.  I would recommend asking the drivers to wait while you hook up your cable box, dish or gaming device to make sure the TV is working properly and didn't suffer any damage during transit.Buy one you won't regret it.","Date":"January 31, 2007"}
{"Title":"Samsung HP-S4253 42\" Plasma","Author":"Peter A. Modrich \"pm\"","ReviewID":"R24K7QB3URN6T0","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this model from Amazon in September 2006. After two months the picture began to stutter and eventually freeze after the set was on for over two hours. Turning the set off momentarily would correct the problem. A Samsung tech came and replaced the motherboard inside the set. In January the picture stutter and freeze began again and the Samsung tech returned and replaced the motherboard again. Its March 2007 and the problem has begun again. On June 30th the Samsung tech returned because of picture and sound freeze. He installed another new motherboard and told me to let him know if I had any other problems. Before he could load his tool box into his van the picture started to freeze again. I called him back, he scratched his head and said \"That isn't right\". He suggested the problem might be the comcast box except the same problem occurs while watching a DVD. He grudgingly admitted the set might be defective. I doubt I can get a refund but I am going to ask Samsung to send out another set. Stay tuned. The tech's only solution is to replace one defective component with another defective motherboard. When it works properly I've enjoyed this TV, but I would not buy another Samsung TV.","Date":"October 2, 2006"}

{"Title":"Better than the S4095 1080p LCD","Author":"James Lin","ReviewID":"RXPUJJOML8P3Y","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this TV for about 5 months now and I've been very happy with it.Back in June 2006, I purchased the Samsung S4095D (1080p LCD) and I had to return it after a month.  The backlight was splotchy and the black levels were really disappointing.  The overall image quality just wasn't very good for a $3000 (at the time) TV.A few months later, I bought the S4253.  At first, I was wary about the relatively low 1024x768 (rectangular pixels!) resolution.  After using it for a week though, I realized that from about 6 feet away, I couldn't tell that the S4253 has a lower resolution.  However, I could definitely see the better contrast ratio and no weird backlight issues.I've been watching upscaled DVDs and playing Wii on it for the past couple of months, and everything looks great.  If you have a Wii, definitely get a set of component cables.  The difference is night and day.The PC input works great too, but you have to uncheck \"Hide modes that this monitor cannot display\" in the monitor properties tab under Display Properties.  This will let you select 1366x768 resolution, which is a proper 16:9 resolution that matches best with this TV.  If you use 1024x768, the image will be stretched.Pros:- Excellent image quality and contrast ratio with no backlight bleeding or  splotching.- Good sounding speakers (much better than the tinny S4095 speakers)- Lots of inputs in the back and side.  See my photo in the photo gallery above.  I have hooked up a PS2 (component), Oppo 970HD, HTPC, and a Wii (component).- No issues with burn in even after long gaming/TV sessions.- Excellent viewing angles.- Cheaper than LCD TVs.Cons:- Slight green tint.  I think this can be fixed with some color settings tweaks and maybe some tweaks in the hidden service menu, but I haven't really tried.  It's really not very noticeable.- Slight buzzing noise from the back.  I don't notice it unless I mute the TV and listen for it.- Heavier than an LCD TV.Notice that I didn't list the 1024x768 resolution as a con.  A TV that is about 40\" or 42\" doesn't really need 1080p.  I've seen both and the better image quality of the plasma really outshines the higher resolution of the LCD.","Date":"February 4, 2007"}

{"Title":"Well Done Samsung","Author":"J. Hepler","ReviewID":"R3DZUCQTE7BBIU","Overall":"good","Content":"The HD picture quality is top notch. The majority of the HD content that I view is from the local over-the-air broadcasts. For my extended service I use DirecTV. This is where I was surprised on how well it delivers the picture. I have a Samsung 50\" DLP also, and while HD content looks great on it, regular programming displays rather poorly. I have noticed this to some degree comparing other DLP, Plasma, LCD sets, but Samsung really delivers a clean image with the HP-S4253 that is ignorant of the signal.The sound quality is fine for a set in this price range. The virtual surround stuff does a good job at tricking your ears, but there is no replacement for an actual home theater system if you are looking to really experience your programming.The functional features are solid, but nothing that really is not on similar models from other vendors. The external appearance of the set is very nice, but I care more about the part that you look at 99% of the time, rather than impressing any one who may stop by. The remote is fine, but Samsung does not put \"back\" button on their remotes. Most folks use a universal of some sort anyhow.Eagle shipping did their job. They called ahead, arrived on time and placed the television on the stand for me.Here are a few miscellaneous notes that may be helpful:Burn-in is less of a problem with modern plasma sets, but should still be taken seriously. It is noted in the product guide, as are the simple instructions to avoid it. In short, don't leave a program on with a dark fixed image for more than a few hours at a time during the sets first few weeks of use. That includes, of course, the  vertical or horizontal bars that may appear when the programs aspect ratio is not the same as the unit. For example, I made sure to toggle the zoom every 30 minutes or so during the first few DVD movies I watched that had horizontal bars.If you are near a major city (within 25 miles) pick up an antenna and check out all of the HD programming that is out there now. Not only is it FREE (minus the antenna cost), it is a noticeably better image than the HD content you pay for on cable or satellite. The local towers send out an uncompressed image and typically use as much as 30Mb, while our beloved cable and satellite providers must compress a multiple HD channels into as little as 5Mb. The HD content on paid providers still look very good though, so don't let this deter you from subscribing to those if you are interested in some the channels they offer.Enjoy your new TV.","Date":"April 11, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great screen for the price","Author":"O-Dawg","ReviewID":"RST4VIV9M1RJY","Overall":"good","Content":"Like everyone else, I shopped around for months looking at all the brands and types of TVs that are out there.  I finally landed on the S4253.  There simply is not another HDTV this size with this picture quality for this price.  Look all you want, you will return here empty handed.  Sure there are some LCDs out there that are razor sharp, but they are around 3x the price.  I'm not really willing to go that far. Every single other plasma (and LCD) in this price range looked terrible compared to the Samsung.  It even looks good while its off, the glossy piano black finish is great.This is the first device that I actually used the various settings on, they do work.  Movie, standard, dynamic.  The different settings of zoom, so you can eliminate the letterboxing that some shows have.  (also getting rid of pesky advertisements some channels run at the bottom of the screen) Nice blue LED around the power button and it makes a little Tivo'ish sound when you turn it on & off.  It even has a simulated surround effect it creates with its two speakers.  It works.  It made me check my surround receiver a couple times to make sure it was not on.  You can clearly hear things behind you.  Its a pretty neat trick.Anyway, in closing, great set.  The only problem I can think of is that it doesn't have a DVI input on it, only SVGA.  Which isn't really a problem, I was just sort of hoping for one.  Plenty of other inputs.  Composite, S, HDMI.  It even has connections on the side so you can hook things up temporarily without having to get behind it.I can't leave without mentioning Amazon.  They were $500.00 less than my local brick and mortar.  Great shipping with Eagle too.  I called the company once I saw it was in my city and asked if I could come pick it up several days early.  They agreed with no hassle.  Great purchase and great overall experience.","Date":"March 30, 2007"}
{"Title":"First time HDTV","Author":"M. Paul \"MP\"","ReviewID":"R35ZPTISNRGNPV","Overall":"good","Content":"After considering several discriminating factors (size, price, user reviews and etc), I was tied between Panasonic and Samsung 42\" Plasma screens. I compared Samsung HP-S4253 and Panasonic TH-42PX60U at the local CircuitCity and BestBuy stores several times. You could not go wrong with either brand.Comparison at the stores:TVs and sound systems are things that you have to go see/hear yourselves before buying. Every body has their personal preferences. Picture quality was the most important factor for my wife and I. Personally, Panasonic had better whites (HD - Discovery channel) compared to Samsung. Other than that, overall color and picture quality (HD movies) looked better on Samsung. My wife could not really tell the difference between the two anyway, except she found the Samsung cabinet more aesthetically pleasing. Based on the specs, Samsung has better features than Panasonic. We decided to order the Samsung from Amazon for ~ $1250 (savings of about $350 with the free wall-mount rebate).At home experience:We got the TV on 12/12/06, about 12 days after ordering. The EGL delivery driver helped me to carry the TV upstairs and unpack. Unfortunately, I didn't have a cable connection upstairs, so I connected an internal antenna and a DVD player with component video output to the TV. The setup was quite intuitive enough. I was lucky enough to get a couple of HD channels over the air (WOSU-HD and ABC). The reception was quite impressive even with a couple of old rabbit ears, something I bought a couple of years ago for $20. I was very pleased with the HD picture quality: good resolution, color, and clarity. Ordinary DVD movies looked good too. I expect the picture quality to improve when I get an upconverting DVD player and Dishnetwork with HD channels. Just don't have the money for it now. I don't hear any buzzing noise as some folks commented. I wish plasmas had individual color settings (Red, Blue, and Green) like the CRT's and DLPs, but the movies are good enough with Dynamic color setting. This is definitely a great TV overall.","Date":"December 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV, price independent","Author":"JcR","ReviewID":"R24GAL6LE8VMFF","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched TV's for a few weeks before purchasing this one.  I read the pros and cons of plasma vs lcd, and reviews of individual models.Initially, I was concerned about plasmas and elevation.  I read that the higher the elevation, the more work the TV has to work to make the picture, often causing a buzz noise.  Most TV's are rated to 6500 ft, and since I'm at 4500 ft, I thought it would be all right.  There is a slight buzz that can be heard if you stick your head behind the set, but can't be heard otherwise.Picture quality is impressive in HD, as expected.  What wasn't expected was the very good picture quality for SD channels as well.  I have a large rear projection Hitachi HD set as well, and the picture quality of non HD channels is almost embarrassing, especially compared to this Samsung plasma.Shipping through Amazon was very fast and Eagle was great to deal with.  I love buying through Amazon due to free shipping and no sales tax.I recommend this set to anyone interested!","Date":"December 10, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV with minor issues","Author":"John F.","ReviewID":"RWFTEDNX0B3MV","Overall":"good","Content":"All in all this is a great TV and for the money I think it is one of the best things going.PROS:Picture: This TV has an excellent picture.  When I upgraded my cable to HD cable I noticed an even better picture.  I sit about 12 feet from the TV and, even when I'm watching a non-HD signal, any pixelization that you get goes unnoticed. So way to go on the picture, Samsung.Inputs:  A ton of inputs.  Two HDMI, PC input, coax, etc.  I use Comcast and both cable boxes that I have from them only have a DVI output, so you need to get a DVI-HDMI cable to view HD signals.CONS:Sound:  The sound is sub-par.  I guess it's safe to assume that anyone in the market for a higher-end TV is going to also have a home theater receiver for sound.  In my case, I don't like to mess with my home theatre receiver for watching \"regular\" TV (the news, etc) so I use the TV's built-in speakers.  When watching something deep bass tones (i.e., music, explosions, or someone with a deep voice) the speakers make a muffled \"farting\" noise as if they are blown.  (sorry, can't think of a better way to describe it).A firmware bug?:  There seems to be a bug with the firmware of the TV that when you switch sources, say, from TV to HDMI to watch a DVD the video will switch but the audio will not.  Most of the time you will loose sound all together, but on more than one occasion I have switched to the HDMI source and I see the movie but still hear what I was watching on TV.  Cycling through the source selection a second time will fix it.Again, all-in-all this is a great TV and would definately recommend it.","Date":"November 3, 2006"}

Eagle shipped and set up in my house within 7 days of completing the order.  I use satellite for my HDTV and recently purchased a UHF amplified antenna for local channels.  I was shocked at the quality of the over the air broadcast.  It is actually equal to the satellite.  The picture is flawless and i don't get any buzzing that some of the other reviewers complained about.  This is the best TV I have ever seen!  Even the channels that don't broadcast in HD look great!  I tried cable HD but canceled and went with satellite when I saw the difference at a friends house.  No comparison.  I recommend setting all of the video to 50.  The vivid setting is just not realistic.  You can move the brightness and contrast up to 60 in a darker room.  Any higher and you do get some pixelation in some darker scenes.  I run my video through the 2 HDMI connections and my audio through my surround sound receiver.  I tried the internal speakers just to get an idea of the quality of sound and it was fine.  Can't really compare to a good 7.1 system though.  The plasmas in the big department stores don't do these screens justice.  With an up converting  1080i DVD player that I also purchased through Amazon, I am totally satisfied.  They say these plasmas will last far longer that the old tube tv's.  I hope so.  The only thing I would change about this Plasma is the gloss black frame.  It looks great until you turn on a light or get sun in the background.  If it was matte finish there wouldn't be any glare at all from the side of the picture but in a dark room that wouldn't matter anyway.  I really can't say enough about this plasma.

{"Title":"best value around.","Author":"D. Porter","ReviewID":"R1RMI4Y7KSVO67","Overall":"good","Content":"I would first like to address the buzzing that everyone seems to complain about.  Standing less than two feet from the tv with the sound turned completely off, yes, I can hear a little buzz.  This is a 42\" tv.  The recommended viewing distance is AT LEAST ten feet, not two.  Plus, if you are going to spend this much money on a tv, you are a fool if you don't buy a sweet surround system to go with it.  In this case, you will never hear buzzing.  After much investigation, the buzzing in plasmas is normal, especially at higher altitudes, but it is not significant enough to bother me.Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase.  If you want the absolute highest resolution in the world, buy an LCD, but you should be prepared to pay twice as much for it.  For me, that was not nearly worth the extra money, and the plasma offers the truest colors.  Comparing the colors to LCD side by side in the store, there was no comparison.  In the color vs. resolution battle, color won.This tv was a great purchase so far (I've had it for a month).  It is not by any means perfect, but for the $1300 I paid for it, I would not dare complain.  If you want perfect, pay the ten grand it's going to cost you.  If you want a great tv at a great price, buy the samsung.","Date":"January 30, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great TV, Great Price","Author":"Thomas H. Pickard \"Tom's Music Fun\"","ReviewID":"R9MBTPL0PVQKY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this set for around 2 months and it is a winner.  I gave 4 stars only because I can't give anything 5. Sound is fine if you don't put in tru-surround.  Plenty of volume as well.  I also have a Sharp Aquas LCD 32\" in my play room and it has better sound but the picture can't compare with the Samsung.  I shopped on line and saw the set at BB and CC and talked to salesman about plasma to LCD and generally was referred to plasma for best picture quality and now that I own one I must say that I would save the money you would have to spend for a large non-plasma.  It does have a ghost on the screen when scenes change and it goes to black but I guess that is the nature of plasma.  They have included features to help if the screen burns in that I haven't had to use yet.  Was told by several reliable people that burn is is not as big a problem with the newer sets.  The first thing you read in the literature is they are not responsible for burn in but I think they are being careful and it is no a big issue anymore.  Amazon had the best price which at the time was $1259.00  I see they raised the price over the holiday. It was $1799.00 at BB over the holidays so without state tax and free shipping it is worth the wait.  It is too big to fit in your car. If you want great tv for a great price this is one that does it all.","Date":"December 28, 2006"}

Personally, I also like the aesthetics of the glossy black bezel as compared to some competitors (e.g. Panasonic). No buzzing noises either, which I was a bit concerned about after reading some reviews. But even if there were buzzing noises, Eagle Freight USA (Amazon's delivery company for large products) will help you set up the TV and give you a chance to test it out to make sure there are no problems. If there are, you can just refuse delivery. Bottom line is, awesome TV with beautiful picture and you don't face any risks.","Date":"December 8, 2006"}
{"Title":"Nice Plasma","Author":"Bruce Freeman","ReviewID":"R1BRPCR3P2YZ58","Overall":"good","Content":"I just received my new HP-S4253 and I am running an HD DVR from my cable company via one of the HDMI inputs.  The HD picture is really sharp and clear and the SD picture is pretty clear and it does a good job with skin color looking natural.  Items that are black are really black and have good detail from my viewing position(about 7 feet back and about 2 feet off center). One of the concerns I had when researching plasmas was the low price for the Samsung.  I'm a believer that you get what you pay for and I'm sure there are 42\" plasmas that are far superior however for the price ( just over $1200) I think you would be really hard pressed to find a better TV.  One thing I do recommend is having a surge protector/line conditioner to clean up the power which helps with the picture.  I have read several reviews here on Amazon that said their TV had a \"buzzing noise\".  I have not experienced that as of yet and I hope to be able to report so after a while.  I still have my 7 year old DVD player which I have connected via the s-video input and the picture is very respectable but I hope to be upgrading that shortly to an upconvert DVD with an HDMI output.  Any way that is my input on this TV and I hope it is useful to those of you on a budget like myself.","Date":"December 6, 2006"}

{"Title":"Be careful of dead pixels","Author":"Shu Pei \"Jingren\"","ReviewID":"R1NHO2TFU0YAUR","Overall":"good","Content":"Our HP-S4253 was bought last Thanksgiving. It was a great plasma TV at the beginning, marvelous HD resolution, vivid color and many useful jacks on the back.However, recently a bright red dot appeared in the center of the screen. This dot is most eye-catching when the background is dark.I called the service center of Samsung and was told that only one dead pixel was not a service issue. Their policy was a seven-dots rule. If you have fewer than seven bright, sometimes flashing red dots on your plasma screen, sorry, that's your own problem.Later I found that every TV manufacturer has its own \"pixel policy\" to deal with complaints about such dots.Customers at a store can open the box and check the TV on spot. But if you buy a LCD or plasma TV online like I did, you are taking a chance.","Date":"March 8, 2007"}

I bought this Samsung HP-S4253 HDTV at [...] Dec 12 and received it a week later. I have been searching for the right for an HDTV for months and spent a lot of time on the internet and in stores comparing different TV Makes and plasma vs LCD. I bought one Sambre 42\" from a military exchange, great price, but I wasn't very satisfy with it, I returned it and continue with the search until I found this Samsung HDTV.  In short, this is the most satistfied item I ever bought! I loved it right from the moment i took it out of the box, it looks very appealing. the image quality is just one word - amazing!!! I connected it to a Samsung DVD recording with an HDMI cable and and played on 8020i mode, there's just no better image quality you could have gotten else where. it's basically like viewing real life through the mirrow... even with new the 8020p mode, the normal eye will not really notice any big difference in quality. It has a good sound quality too, the remote controle has everything you'll espect from a beyond-average, user's guid tells you everything you need to know in simple terms. the color desplay is very pure, the black depth is so great that when I compared it with my small LCD monitor TV, I just don't want to look at LCD again. besides, there's nothing you're missing out with LCD on this plasma, it's got a 60,000 hrs life spand and a burn in control technology. with the satisfaction from this tv quality, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay a couple hundred dollars more for it. Have already made up my mind to stick with Samsung for electronics.","Date":"December 26, 2006"}

{"Title":"Graet TV for the price!...Do Not Hesitate to Buy","Author":"S. Fallon","ReviewID":"RDAQ3SDLCDCOR","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV on 10/31/2006. It's been one year. I have had absolutely no problems whatsoever. I've noticed a few people's comments about a blue pixel showing up on the screen..I have not had this problem.I did have my screen professionally wall-mounted.But, I don't think the professional installation has had anything to do with long-term quality.I originally paid $1599.00 for this TV from a big-box store. I can't believe the price is around $950-$999. There may be newer versions with supposedly better features, BUT, for the price, this TV is great! The reason I bought this TV was that 2 guys who worked in the store personally owned this unit. I figured they must know what they are doing.Some have commented about the buzzing noise when the volume is turned up--I keep the volume on zero and feed it through a stereo system so I have never had the humming/buzzing problem people are talking about. However, I have turned off my stereo and used the volume built into the TV and did notice a humming sound.If you are considering buying this TV but do not plan to hook it up to a home stereo of some sort..you might want to reconsider buying this unit. But, if you plan to use your stereo volume---then no problem. I guess the humming could be considered a drawback.  One interesting anecdote about this unit. It will definately induce envy from your friends and family.One of the selling points of this TV,to me, was it's piano-black-finish edges. This gives it the look of the expensive Pioneer Elite TVs. I don't personally like flat screen TVs with the greyish borders--they tend to look plastic and cheap. This TV looks expensive! It's a show-stopper if you wall mount it like I have, very clean and neat looking.  Overall I want to state that I have no specific allegiance to Samsung. I am not a Samsung employee. I do not own Samsung stock. I used to think of Samsung as a low to mid quality Korean electronics maker.If you had told me 5 years ago I would be paying $1599.00 for ANYTHING Samsung..I would have told you, you were crazy! Overall, I have been very satisfied. I would not hesitate to recommend this TV, especially for the price as it stands today.","Date":"November 9, 2007"}

The TV performance is great, with \"regular\" cable the picture is good but not great, I hooked up an external HD antenna to get our local HD broadcasts and WOW!

Viewing angle is fantastic, picture is clear and visible anywhere in the room. Sound is a little hard for me to hear the midranges, but I'm old and a little hard of hearing, so I don't know that this is due to the TV or me.All in all, an excellent TV, very nice styling, easy to use menus and controls... highly recommended!","Date":"January 11, 2007"}

No question the picture is extra crisp in HD (though I can't really compare it to but a 20+ year old Sony 27\" near flat screen trinitron).  The menu controls are pretty well laid out.  The component plugins in the back and sides were a little difficult to figure out, but trial and error eventually saw me through.  The (universal - nice!) remote is big and the only thing that bothers me so far is that to change the channel, the enter button is 3-4 inches below the number buttons, or you can just wait until 1 or 2 seconds later as it accepts your button presses.  The speakers pretty much tops out at the 50% zone.  If you have a livingroom with 10 people who are talking, your TV will lose out to your guests' volume.  Also on a side note, the lettering on the bezel was scuffed a good bit when I received it, though has nothing to do with performance of the TV.","Date":"January 3, 2007"}

The picture is incredible and it offers plenty of connection options including 2 HDMI inputs, and a composite input on the side of the TV if you need to connect your Video Camera.One important feature if you have kids is Pixel Shift.

I got it for a good price ($1300 at a retail store), and was really pleased with look of the TV in my room.  The styling is really nice.  It went down hill from there.  I watched my first episode of 24 on the TV and thought the dark scenes looked terrible.  There is way too much noise and a lot of pixelation in dark/shaded scenes.  I owned a Vizio VP42 Plasma that did a much better job at displaying dark scenes.  This wasn't a deal breaker though.  Then I noticed the TV makes a buzzing noise.  Its only something you can hear when the TV is muted, but it is still irritating.  After watching the TV for only a week using toned down settings, I have an image burned into my TV.  I am extremely [...] when it comes to burn in.  I don't play video games on it, I just watch TV.  I keep the brightness and contrast down to protect the screen.  The logo from our local Fox affiliate is permanently burned into the screen after only a week of use.  A week!!  This isn't the only channel I watch....in fact, I only watch this channel about 1/10th of the time.  I tried the image wash thing for several hours, and watched a channel with no static images for several hours and the burned image is still there.

When I first took it out of the box I would have rated this a 5, but now that I've owned it for a while and compared to other TVs...it gets a 4.  Don't get me wrong...I like it, but there are some things to consider.  As also pointed out on cNet.com, the set does have some noise and artifacts that linger from time to time.  For example, when I'm watching a game and switch to another channel...remnants of the score box will sometimes linger on the screen for about 60 seconds.  It's not the end of the world, but it is something that can take a bit of the luster out of a $1,500 TV purchase.  Also, this is not a 1080i television.  For a few hundred more dollars...you get upgrade to a 1080i and be ready for the real future of HDTV.  What keeps it at a 4 are the following: the HD picture (when not switching channels the picture is awesome and the blacks are very black), the number of video/audio connection alternatives, the PIP feature and the eye pleasing design.  I hope this helps.  Happy shopping!","Date":"January 16, 2007"}

My PS2 games also look amazing.  I can't say enough how great the set looks with it's black finish, illuminating eye, and sleek look.

It has pixel shift, white screen, and sweeping screen to prevent burn in.  haven't had burn in yet so I have to wait and see how effective it is.PIP doesn't allow you to watch 2 tv stations at once.  when i change cable/antenna channels, the audio cuts out for a second shortly after the image appears.

{"Title":"Amazing picture, great value","Author":"C. Nelson \"Plasma Hound\"","ReviewID":"R6ZKW5L4ASQH2","Overall":"good","Content":"Like I said, the picture is absolutely stunning. That is, of course when you are watching an HDTV broadcast, or a DVD (especially if you have either an up-convert DVD player, or the real deal HD DVD or Blue Ray). When you are watching a non-HDTV broadcast, the picture is marginally better than a standard non-Plasma. But, hey, let's face it, regular broadcast shows aren't why we buy HDTV ready TVs. The color saturation is one of the best I've seen at any price point from any set, and the contrast is phenomenal. There are very flexible options for color, sound, and burn prevention in the on-screen menu. I should mention that if you are watching a channel in 4:3 format (and there are black bars on the sides of the screen), for any length of time, when you switch to a 16:9 channel, you will see some ghosting. No problem, though. You can get a DVD to run that flashes colors randomly to \"erase\" these lines. There are plenty of inputs for your home theater needs, and the shiny black finish is icing on the cake. This is a terrific deal for a truly beautiful picture.","Date":"January 4, 2007"}

The sleek black finish surrounding the display did please me, and would definitely match my black tv stand. When I went to the store, I was amazed by the way Samsung, Toshiba 42HP66, and Panasonic TH-42PX60U present life-like colors. All three popular models render pictures similarly. Toshiba even has the best price.But when I did a side-by-side compare between Samsung and Panasonic, things turned out differently. They both maintain the fidelity very well. But Panasonic's picture is much cleaner whether it's still or transitioning. Samsung on the other hand can't suppress noise (flickering lines & dots) from coming out in the corner or some off-center area. We have done the comparison in four stores, my friend and I both agree. That feels like a film being played too many times starts to get slight wear (of course, not that significant), as opposed to Pana which is virtually noise-free.Although Samsung's finish seems to make the display bigger (not sure it's also scratch-proof), but hey.. you paid for a 42\" tv, why pretend? :P If you are looking for the best quality and picture, go for a Panasonic!","Date":"July 19, 2006"}

I purchased the tv for $1399 with a free basic wall mount.  I was looking for anything too fancy, but for the price and size, I really couldn't complain. For the most part the overall look and ease of use is great.My current connections include my first gen xbox through component input, and standard cable through coax, with no plans to go HD in the near future.  However I read that if you got an Up Conversion DVD player, it would aid in picture quality.  So a week later, I purchase the Samsung DVD-R135, Samsung Progressive-Scan DVD-R/-RW Recorder with HD Upconversion.NOW, FOR THE GOOD AND THE BADTo get the full use of the dvd, you have to connect using HDMI.  The good, I can say that the quality of my standard cable have very much improved.  DVD playback is great.The bad, if I use the dvd to watch cable, I get noise and loss of sound level.  I don't know if it's the dvd causing the noise or the tv, but dvd playback sounds great!NOW, here's another possible audio glitch. When I'm watching tv through my basic cable and I switch to either Xbox (component1) or dvd(HDMI1) I will not get any audio.  This happens moreso when I power on either devices prior to switching to that input on the tv.  When this happens, I just have to power off and back on.  Now, this has happened more frequently than I care for, and may be the deciding factor of whether or not I'm going to exchange or just return the tv all together.","Date":"January 2, 2007"}

{"Title":"Gorgeous with a wonderful picture, overall Samsung has created a winning LCD HDTV.","Author":"C. Cascone \"DucatiRacer\"","ReviewID":"R377TOXIFFVDIK","Overall":"good","Content":"Flat HDTV prices are falling almost as fast as the stock market these days.  It would seem that this might be the right time to jump into the HDTV craze.  Let the research begin then.  I'll get to the details of the Samsung unit itself after a brief, er, long background intro.I tend to be the type of consumer that will read every unbiased CR style review, online article, visit every store within a 100-mile radius and test every model in existence--no matter what the purchase.  This is particularly helpful when purchasing a television, since you really don't know just how good a picture will be, no matter what the specs say, until you see it side-by-side with the competition.I've been holding out for the $2000 price-point for a large-screen Flat HDTV, and the time has now come when there are several options from which to chose.  CR reports, quite accurately I might add, that Costco has some of the best prices among retailers, but I will say, as a HUGE Costco fan, that the selection is a bit limited, as is the nature of their business.After looking at about 50 (literally) different Flat-TV's, and originally wanting to go with a Plasma, I narrowed the choice to a 37-inch LCD from Viewsonic, a 42-inch LCD from Philips, and two 40-inch Samsung LCD units.  Consideration was made for size, picture quality, design and style, features, overall research and brand reputation/reviews, value, bang-for-the-buck and more.  Say what you will about Plasma, and they are beautiful, I've seen too many red-glow, distorted and burned pictures, and the last straw was a brand new floor model that had already gone bad in 2-weeks at a local store.  LCD it is then--I purchased the Viewsonic at Costco, only to receive a unit with a defective tuner, back to the store for a full refund--no worries.  As I'm strolling through the aisles of another establishment, I come across a vision of beauty, she looks amazingly like Liberace's reincarnated baby-grand piano.  She is brilliant in her little black dress, even standing next to the costliest supermodels from Pioneer and Sony--in fact, she may be more beautiful.  The Samsung LNS4051D they tell me.  Samsung name, 2 HDMI inputs, 4000:1 contrast ratio, PIP, you know the rest...and stunning good looks to boot!  But the cost was too high.  A few clicks later, I find her on Amazon for my target price, including shipping...S-O-O-O-L-D, says I!!  Return policy is a bit harsh, but delivery was on-time, and price was unbeatable.  Well done Amazon.Panasonic may hold a slight edge in overall picture quality, but Samsung is the world's largest producer of LCD screens, and they can be quite proud of this unit.A few areas for improvement--not even the most beautiful of ladies is perfect--blacks still need work, which is what keeps it from being the best-of-the-best, the remote needs work (don't they all), and once hung on the wall, the connections are nearly impossible to access, due to the back, rather than side connecting style.Flat HDTV prices are slated to continue falling over the summer, and will then flatten out--if you are lucky, you might just be able to snag a date with one of these hot little numbers, before they're all spoken for.","Date":"June 9, 2006"}
{"Title":"Definitely feel like I made the right choice in HDTVs","Author":"Lori H","ReviewID":"RIF0PG5FLPPU8","Overall":"good","Content":"Like others, I took a long time before making the decision to finally purchase a large screen flat panel television.  Finally, with prices coming down so much, I decided to purchase one.  I bought this tv directly from Amazon.  They had an extremely competitive price, no sales tax, and were offering free delivery.  As has already been noted, that equated to hundreds of dollars of savings compared to purchasing the same tv at the local large outlet stores.  Initially, I narrowed my buying choices down to a 42\" Panasonic plasma that had been highly rated, Sony Bravia LCD, or the Samsung that I ended up purchasing.  First I chose LCD over the plasma for several reasons:  1. plasma is newer technology than LCDs, so has less of a track record as far as known durability and working life; 2. LCDs for the comparable size weigh less and because of the technology they use and construction materials tend to be more durable; 3. LCDs use less energy and do not have the same potential noise issues (buzzing) that plasmas can have; 4. no burn in issues; 5. much less screen glare with an LCD because the display panel is not a shiny sheet of glass;  and 6. prices of LCDs have dropped to be comparable to plasmas.  Also, in terms of viewing angle, LCD technology has caught up enough that plasmas no longer have an edge in that one.  Finally with regard to contrast ratios, although most definitely plasmas generally have much higher contrast ratios, both static and dynamic, most manufacturers inflate their numbers, oversell the importance of these numbers and measure under the most extreme conditions that consumers don't watch their tvs under.  Whether you care about contrast ratio really depends on the ambient lighting situation, in very very bright light conditions (i.e. sun light) you may be able to tell the difference between two tvs where one has a higher contrast ratio.  But under normal indoor conditions, and especially in a dark room, and watching programming that is not in 100% black and white (I mean when do you watch something like that?) the need for the higher contrast ratio wont even come into play and the viewer in a darkened room watching normal programming will notice no difference between tvs that have different contrast ratios.  Then after deciding to get an LCD I ended up choosing the Samsung over the Sony.  After physically looking at both tvs in the stores multiple times I thought that Samsung had the better picture.  And money wise Samsung was a better bargain for the quality of tv you got.As far as getting the tv, the delivery was a little delayed, and I was not all that impressed or happy with Amazon's shipper Eagle delivery service.  But hey, it was free, and when they did deliver it, it came in perfect condition.  Setting up the tv was easy, the main thing is to have the best connector cables (HDMI & component) and optimize, to the extent you can, the signal source to make sure you're getting the best picture out of the tv.  I have Comcast digital with a DVR, made sure to use HDMI connections (on that I didn't buy Monster, but an HDMI to DVI cable that cost a fifth of the price and works great also ordered from Amazon); and component cable for the DVD player.  Also made sure the output settings on the cable box were 1080i for HD broadcasts and 480p for standard definition broadcasts, and the DVD player set at 480p for progressive scan.  Picture looks beautiful.  HD channels are amazing in their clarity.  Even the standard definition programs look good on this tv.  I initially thought the sound was so so, but then used better RCA cables and it improved a lot.  Though, I have everything hooked up to a 5.1 surround sound system so don't really use the actual tv speakers much.  Overall I am very pleased with this television.  The picture quality is one of the best I've seen for the money.  The functions on the tv are easy to learn, the remote also was easy to pick up and just start using.  Also, the tv comes with plenty of inputs.  Though, I would have preferred if they had two component inputs instead of just one.  Finally, the tv physically  looks great, piano black, clean lines, a nice addition to the living room.  I highly recommend this tv.","Date":"August 30, 2006"}
{"Title":"The best choice for the money","Author":"P. Luciani","ReviewID":"R784Y9O1UYHRZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this tv back in June it has the best picture quality that ive seen in this price range i saved about $700 over circuit city hey no tax and no shipping cost. Just a note to Michael Barry from NYC who didnt like this tv. You have to have an HD signal coming into this tv first of all. Second call your cable company they should give you a HD coverter box, and spend the money on the HDMI cables (pricy but worth it, i paid $120 ea. and i needed two), i also bought a Monster clean power box to filter the signal and stop any further types of interferance. Your picture will look blurry and not clear if you just screw the coaxil cable into the back of this tv and watch non HD channels, in my area for example all of the major networks brodcast in HD and they still brodcast in analog to, for example ABC in the regular signal is channel 7 and to watch ABC in HD it's channel 707, my HD channels are in the 700's. These tv's are not like the old tv's we are use to when we just screwed the cable in the back and that was it. The HD signal is the fuel that makes these tv's go.","Date":"September 2, 2006"}
{"Title":"Don't Hesitate on this one if you are moving from non-HDTV","Author":"nasagolfer \"Michael\"","ReviewID":"R2HO5AGQ3PA7IZ","Overall":"good","Content":"You really have to do your homework when you are moving into HDTV for the first time.  There are basically three types of technology out there; DLP, LCD, and Plasma.  I was so tempted to go all the way to DLP but I decided on LCD because of all the great reviews that it gets and because of the great look LCD's have in the store.  I also had a friend that had already invested in LCD over a year ago and his investment still looked great when we last watched a football game together.  Plasma was just out of the question because of past burn in issues.  DLP is still improving and is about one step away from resolving the light bulb replacement issue altogether.  When they get a permanent LED white light bulb, DLP will become my new first choice.  So, I decided to go with a flat panel LCD HDTV.The next question was what resolution did I need.  This came down to the size TV and the size of the room where I was going to be watching it.  I only had 40 inches of horizontal width for a TV body to fit within and this TV allowed me to make maximum use of my limited space by locating the speakers to the bottom and in the back.  With this 40 inch TV, HD resolution of 1366 x 768 (720p) is basically indistinquishable to my eyes from 1080p TV's sitting on the showroom floor when I was standing over 6 feet away.  So, I saw no reason to buy something that I really didn't need.  Plus, I don't own an HD DVD or Blue Ray DVD yet so I was not going to be driving this thing with a 1080p signal anyway.  Additionally, the best that can ever be broadcast in HD is 1080i, thus another reason not to buy a full 1080p HDTV now.  So, for me, this 40 inch model really fit the bill.I didn't purchase from Amazon because at the time that I made my purchase this TV was only 50 bucks more at CC (tax included) than from Amazon shipped and I didn't want to wait two days for it to ship.  So, I bought it and brought it home.  I got it home and had it out of the box and running in probably less than 30 minutes and it was amazing.  The next day I went by Comcast and picked up a Digital Tuner box.  They were out of the DVR boxes which have the HDMI interface so I just took their standard box with the component (red,green,blue) cables and hooked them into this TV.  I have to say that \"stunning\" does not capture how great the picture on this TV looks just from component feed and all for only an additional 5 bucks a month on my standard cable bill with Comcast.Of course you might say that I didn't need to get a TV with a HDTV tuner if I'm using a digital tuner cable box and driving the TV with the component video source and for now you would be correct.  I certainly could do what I'm doing now with an \"HD Ready\" TV and that is something you may want to think about before you buy.  I do plan to get a stand alone HD antennae for the locally transmitted HD channels in the event that I want to see these in the highest resolution this TV offers.  The digital tuner cable box also supports a coax cable signal pass through feature as well which I currently have hooked up but have failed to get to work as of yet.  Also, depending on your cable service, you may or may not need a digital tuner box to see some of the HD channels available from your cable provider.  My friend receives all of the local free HD channels directly over his cable without the need for a digital tuner cable box.Anyway, the bottom line is, if you've been waiting to jump into HDTV and you are moving from old non-HDTV, this is a great model to go with.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.  The picture is nothing short of amazing.  I had no idea what I've been missing out on.  Watching some of the college basketball games was almost like looking through a glass pane at the live action on the basketball court.  You can see things happening almost like being there in person right from the comfort of your living room.The only negative that I can share with you is that I have noticed some rattling with the speakers especially when you have them turned up a bit and there are some low frequencies that are sustained long enough for the speakers to resonate a bit.  Of course, this won't even be a problem when you buy that next must have item, the surround sound system, and hook it up.  I don't notice this often.  Its very infrequent.  The built in simulated surround sound feature was okay but nothing I'm going to use in lieu of getting a true surround sound system down the road some time.Also, there is mention in the operator's manual for this TV about a possible concern over burn in when running the TV in 4:3 mode for extended periods of time.  In this mode the image only occupies the center of the screen leaving two vertical black lines on either side of the TV image.  I have run this TV in 4:3 very long and I have seen no such problem.  I believe this is an error in the manual that probably was an artifact of copying and pasting repeated portions of text from TV manuals supporting a variety of TV types including plasma where this is a known problem.Finally, find a good price on your cables and don't buy something that you don't need.  I bought a new component cable and when I picked up the digital tuner from Comcast the component video cable came with it.  So, I had a cable I didn't need.  And, I guess, HDMI cables don't come with new DVD players.  I haven't found one yet with them included.  In some cases the cable costs more than the player.

Nicholson","ReviewID":"R1EX6MJFCEEHSY","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture on this LCD TV  can be summed up with one word...Stunning!I investigated several LCD TVs before I bought this one; and I'm very happy with my decision.The Pros:1.) Crystal clear image when viewed from a source with High Def.(HD) broadcast AND you have the necessary cables. [see below Cons: 1.)]2.) 4000:1 contrast ratio: this is basically a comparison between the whitest white and the blackest black that the TV can give. This ratio is outstanding and accounts for some of the units exceptional video performance.3.) Lots of inputs on the back; 2x HDMI inputs, 1x S-Video, components, PC connections; as well as output jacks for connections to home theatres.4.) Inputs on the side of the unit for external devices such as video games and camcorder; these include an A/V input and a S-Video input jack. There is also a Headphone jack for private listening.5.) The external cabinet is a high gloss metallic surface that just glistens; I don't think I ever seen a TV as eye appealing as this one.6.) Comes with a good swivel stand and fully functioning remote.The Cons:1.) The unit does not come with any connecting cables except for the power cord; so, if you want the best HD reception you need to get a triple video  (Y/pb/pr)  or a HDMI cable. Also, you may require S-Video or component cables if they are needed for other external input devices (VCR, DVD etc).2.) Some other reviewers have felt the audio/speakers were somewhat weak; I thought they were adequate. I purchased this unit for its video aspect; if  I want top end sound I can hook this TV up to my stereo system.All in all, in spite of the minor concerns mentioned above, this is an outstanding LCD TV; the picture is as good as I could ever wish for. If your looking to invest in a high end HD TV, then you owe it to yourself to check out this unit before you make your decision. 5 Stars.","Date":"November 18, 2006"}

Amazon's delivery service was amazing. They delivered the tv, unpacked it and even connected it to cable to our satisfaction. Only then we signed off the delivery.The TV picture is so cool I can see details in the picture that are missing from old crt tvs. The set is sleek with its piano black finish and looks great even when the set is turned off. The sound system could be a better though. As, you increase the volume, you  can realize the speakers are not able to keep up. However, I am planning to hook up the tv to a home theater sound system. So, this will not be a problem. I compared many TVs like the Sony Bravia (whose aesthetics are equally crappy like the ps3), Panasonic, Sharp Aquos and finally settled on this TV. This set is cheaper than the lns4092d. The lns4092D has a higher dynamic contrast ratio.Initially, I was skeptical about ordering online, but 500 dollars difference in price (at the brick and mortar store) is a lot.","Date":"June 4, 2006"}

I had been agonizing for several weeks about upgrading my television viewing.  This was a major purchase for me and I spent hours on the web looking at reviews for LCD and Plasma televisions and suffered from major electronics confusion.  Plasma looked good, but I worried about the \"burn\" problem with plasma screens.  LCD didn't have these problems but offered \"trail problems\" with motion.  What size to get??  I had a 20 inch Toshiba bought 4 years ago.  I thought that the 32 inch size would be overkill for me, but after looking at the available plasma and LCD televisions at local retailers, I found that the 37 inch and 40 inch televisions were not only wider, but SIGNIFICANTLY larger in the vertical dimension of the larger sets.  This made the 32 inch sets not very attractive to me.Now the thing that finally sold me on Samsungs product was the DNIE technology which effictively solves the trail problem on LCD television sets, at least in my opinion.  I just don't think that you can go wrong with a set like this.  It has completely blown my mind in the last hour.  I have seen detail that never existed on any previous set that I have owned, or watched for that matter.  The colors are absolutely wonderful, so vibrant and rich, they are a joy to view.The set was easy to set up, and I am still learning about it, but I am convinced that each day will bring a little more joy from this technological marvelAmazon \"ROCKS\", price, delivery speed, and ease of purchase are 10 out of 10 on the scale for this great televison.UPS did a great job of getting me the tv very very quickly, and got it up the steps to my front door with zero defects or damage.

{"Title":"After months of research, the winner is...Samsung LNS- 4051D!","Author":"Dennis Hawley","ReviewID":"R3SS39XXMZEK3P","Overall":"good","Content":"Like so many others, I've been researching large-screen televisions for quite a while, reading countless reviews and repeatedly visiting stores to compare the various sets.  And also like many others, I decided against large box CRTs, plasma and DLP sets for well-known reasons (at least among people who have researched these competing technologies) and in favor of LCD technology. I then determined what features would be appropriate for my viewing habits (mostly movies), what price I was able to afford and finally, which brand and model to select.  While I checked out the usual suspects (Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, JVC, Sharp, Panasonic) and a few `orphan' brands (Westinghouse, Olevia, Vizio) I finally came down decisively on the Samsung.  There's a very good reason why they've come to dominate the market.I intended to order a particular Samsung model (the LNS 4041D) from Amazon, as they seemed to have the best price, and buyers' feedback on delivery was generally very positive (I had just ordered an Oppo DV-970HD upconverting DVD player from Amazon a week ago and was anxious to get the TV now).  Before ordering, however, I went to both of the big name stores (BB and CC).  BB had that set listed for $1,299, but it was not in stock.  I went to nearby CC, thinking they might have it and match the price.  They did not have it, but had the newer 4051D in stock for...$1,299 (with 2 HDMI connections, 4,000 to 1 contrast ratio and lots more).  I went to purchase it and found that there was a `promotional special' in effect by Samsung, which was an incredible deal.  I bought the LNS-4051D, 40\" LCD set, plus custom Firedog wall mounting installation (regular $299), plus high quality wall mounting brackets (regular $204), plus tax for a grand total of $1,156!  Sorry, Amazon.It took about an hour to move my other TV (a 32\" JVC, quite heavy), disconnect some components and connect the Oppo (which came with a gold-plated HDMI cord).  Out of the box and connected to standard definition satellite signals, the image wasn't impressive.  However, a few minutes of easy tweaking brought the image closer to that of the JVC.  The high resolution of the Samsung definitely brings out the limitations of standard broadcast signals, but it still looks as good as analog CRTs (especially when changing the picture size to 4:3 ratio).  After viewing regular SD programming for a while, I put into the Oppo the widescreen Steven Spielberg remake of `War of the Worlds', tweaked the settings a bit more and beheld.  Wow.  The upconversion brought the quality of this 480p disc to near HD quality.  The difference between the Samsung and the JVC CRT set was immediate and pronounced.  It was almost like watching the film for the first time.  I then put on `Roxy Music Live from the Apollo'.  With my Yamaha receiver set on DTS and the surround volume cranked up, it nearly blew me into next week.  I've watched that concert several times, but once it was displayed upconverted to the Samsung, it was like being there in person.  Simply stunning.While it remains to be seen what my reaction will be to real HD signals, I can safely assume that it will be even more jubilance (and when prices drop in half, a HD DVD player will be on the menu).  So far, I could not be more pleased with the purchase.  It is also worth noting that the gloss piano black finish makes this unit look like a veritable work of art.  Some have complained about it, probably due to it attracting dust.  This may be true, but included with the set are soft clothes designed for cleaning the bezel and back of the set.  Since my surround speaker system is NHT that are finished in gloss piano black, the whole setup looks fantastic.  After cutting the system off for the night, I just sat there admiring it for a while, before going to bed and dreaming of high definition viewing yet to come.  I am very, very pleased with this great television","Date":"December 18, 2006"}

Regarding sound, I think Samsung made the right compromise.  It's completely fine for a small room; if you have a big room, you have space for a more extensive sound system.What I actually want to review is Amazon's service.  I found them offering this TV not at the lowest price on the web, but lowest among any dealers I had ever heard of.  Read dealer reviews; there are lots of horror stories.We live in suburban Dallas and placed the order for this TV with Amazon at 11:30 AM on 2/20, with an estimated delivery date 2/26 - 2/28, and received notice at 4:09 PM that same day that it had shipped. Tracking the shipment showed it was actually picked up in Cincinnati at noon, departed there at 8:00 PM, and arrived in Dallas on 2/22 at 11:21 AM.We were called that day by Eagle to arrange delivery for Saturday morning 2/24, and when I hesitated (due to a full schedule), they offered Friday afternoon.  My wife, on the phone at the time, and I both jumped at that chance.  The TV arrived and was set in place in our house at 4:15 PM on 2/23.

I knew it was going to be a big investment and I was determined to make the right choice. So, I read everything I could find about HDTV's and eventually learned a lot.  Once I was felt that I was educated enough, I started shopping. The Samsung LNS4051D had the best specs I could find for the price, so placed my order.ORDER/SHIPPING:  Amazon makes it very easy to place your order and the buying experience was great as always. Shipping on the other hand, didn't go so smooth. Amazon estimates 3-5 Days, THIS IS NOT TRUE. Eagle Shipping Company will probably get it to you in about 7-10 days from the timeit ships. But let me say this....Eagle has the best customer service ever! When I realized that my TV wasn't going to get to me in the estimated 3-5 Days I called Eagle and explaind my problem. They were very responsive and very helpful. Even though it was not their fault Amazon had told me the wrong shipping time, Eagle rushed the delivery so that I would have it in time for a family event I was hosting. The were really great!THE HDTV:  WOW! Let me tell you, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I love the televison. The picture is amazing, sound is more than adequate, the design is gorgeous and the features are great. My one and only complaint is that it only has ONE component input. Sure, 2 HDMI inputs are great but my XBOX 360 and DVD player/surround sound system require component so I have to switch the cables back and forth. But you know what they say, \"You can never have enough inputs\"Summary  I strongly recommend this HDTV!

{"Title":"Excellent Choice","Author":"Head Shrink","ReviewID":"R28RNNDYLFX4LL","Overall":"good","Content":"I, like many other, spent significant time researching LCD televisions. C-NET and others advised the Sony over the Samsung. I have seen both in action at the homes of friends and my eye viewed the Samsung as every bit as good in picture quality if not better than the Sony. So the decision was made on the Samsung based on features and price, anywhere from $200 to $500 cheaper based on my research. The next decision was whether to risk making such a high dollar purchase online, Amazons price being $400 to $600 less than the brick and mortar stores. After reading many reviews here on Amazon, I decided to pull the trigger and order from Amazon. It was an EXCELLENT CHOICE. The set was ordered on a Friday morning, and arrived via EGL on Amazons super saver free freight rate on Tuesday. Three business days or five calendar days. The set beat my satellite installer so I wasn't expecting much from the picture as I pulled it out of the box. I set it up to make sure it was functioning, and as expected the standard def channels were fuzzy. For kicks I connected my cheap Radio Shack rabbit ears into the antenna connection, and went searching for over the air high definition. What I found was that all the networks carried digital channels as did the fringe channels. I am getting Fox, NBC,CBS, CW, and the MY CHANNEL stations in either 480p or 720p. I also get a PBS HD signal in 1080i. When the networks broadcast their hi-def signals they all come in in either 720p or 1080i. All this on a cheap ten dollar Radio Shack rabbit ears antenna. I have a friend who bought a DLP projection, something I was looking at, and he only receives a 480p signal. Samsung obviously got it right with their built in HD tuner. Samsung got it right with their picture as well. Have had none of the picture issues C-NET talks about. Blacks are definately black, whites are very white, no ghosts, no shadows and no picture lag. I highly recommend this set.","Date":"October 15, 2006"}
{"Title":"Outstanding, and NO glare!!!!!!!","Author":"Hockey Nut","ReviewID":"R1FUXWGVYMCE2N","Overall":"good","Content":"This tv is amazing. Great picture, tons of features and price is right. This tv has it all. You can use HDMI (has 2, maybe one for a dvd player and PS3 and so on). I hooked up my HDMI capabale DVD player and the picture and sound are perfect (you need to change the sound setting within your DVD player to get the sound). I even hooked up my xBox 360 and was floored. Standard tv through satellite is not as bad as I thought. I see people having problems but I have a soulution if you do not want to spend \"more\" money on HD (I know, it is an HDTV afterall). Instead of using the coax, use S-Video and audi cables. My wife was opposed to the tv at first. We have been using a 32\" Sony tube tv that I bought when I re-enlisted in the Air Force back in '99. So this was an upgrade to a dying breed of tv and dying tv. So I hooked up the S-Video and she was happy with the quality. Also, if you have Direct TV and the picture looks squished in widescreen and you are coming from a tube tv, there is a setting with in the Direct Tv tuner to set it to widescreen. Most problems people have are usually 9 times out fo 10 either correctable or operator error. I ran into about 5 of them when I hooked this beast up and all were fixable due to my error. What is also great about this tv is you can contol an iPod through it (connector sold seperatly), hook up a computer, a camera/camcorder, has \"2\" HDMI hookups, a USB port, has Picture In Picture (although not as good as the Phillips TV0. Another good thing about LCD tvs compared to Plasma is this, \"GLARE\". Facing out TV is a Bay window. Even though we have blinds we would still get nasty reflections on our tv. Plasma was just as bad due to its glass screen. With the LCD, no glare whats so ever. SOLD. You can not beat this TV. You get more than what you pay for. Also, with the hidden speakers (sound great), it looks a bit less bulky than most. As with most tv's, it is customizable to fit your needs and likes. What more is there to want. The only thing I found that this tv is lacking is that it does not fetch a beer or walk my dog.","Date":"January 16, 2007"}

I considered the 32\" for a while and then got \"feature creep\". For only a few hundred extra bucks I got the 40\" and I'm glad I did. So I dove in and bought it from Amazon.PROSNice big picture! Super lightweight relative to Cathode Ray Tubes tvs.Superior picture quality with HD and with DVDs. Easy to configure.NO motion artifacts. Standard LCD horror stories do not apply on this model.The Eagle shipping was great. Mine shipped from harrisburg PA to the DC area, so it was FAST and without problem. They called me one day and we scheduled delivery on the next day between 2PM and 6PM. Shipper arrived promptly at 2 and carried the box into my home. Great service.CONSThe picture quality is absolutely top notch. As you will find, standard cable signal quality is NOT so good. In other words, your TV can display an astonishing picture quality that reveals the severe limitations of standard definition cable signals.HD on the other hand is AMAZING. You'll find that you prefer watching film of paint dry on Discovery HD to your favorite TV show on standard channels. My only advice is get used to it!True black tones are not true black on an LCD. They're real close, but not perfect. This is probably the single limitation of LCD displays. You can tell, but you probably won't care given how good everything looks. Or, if you can't deal with this, get yourself a plasma.The sound volume is not strong. Sound quality is fine but volume is weak. This thing has 5W or 10W sound - look at the specs. It's OK for just watching TV on most channels but you have to pump it to 50-70% on certain channels. If you are hard of hearing, have a big room, live in a noisy environment, or just like it loud, you will need reinforcement. And, clearly, for theater sound you will need reinforcement but that is true for any model of TV.Overall very happy with the product and with Amazon's role as my merchant.","Date":"January 8, 2007"}

At first, they did not understand why I couldn't undo the entire installation to salvage the cable. When I pointed out to them that people pay hundreds of dollars for an installation, they saw my point. They did not seem so hot on getting the word out or updating their manual, even though they admitted that it was wrong. So, if anyone else has similar problems, I hope you might find the trail I blazed useful. Samsung Executive Customer Relations' phone number is 800-522-7341. And for reference, my case number was 3000115125.UPDATE: I finally got up the strength to stay on hold with Samsung customer support.They admitted that the manual has incorrect information.  In other words, this TV cannot output 5.1 Channel surround sound.  Go figure.++++I am very happy with this television for most of the reasons described in the other comments.Here are some words about the audio. I ran an HDMI cable from my cable box to my TV and I ran a second HDMI cable from my DVD to my TV. Then, I connected an optical audio cable from my TV to my receiver. I found that in this set-up, the TV is not capable of bypassing the full audio signal. The result is that you cannot listen to surround sound in over two channels. This means, you cannot, for exmaple, listen to movies in 5.1 Dolby surround mode. The solution is to wire the cable box and the dvd player (and any other components you may wish) directly into the receiver. Of course, this means you have more buttons to push each time you want to watch something. And it also means that you need to have plenty of input jacks on your receiver for digital audio. And of course, you need to buy the extra cables.Incidentally, the TV manual does say that it can bypass 5.1 channel audio. I have a new samsung DVD player plugged into the TV, and the 5.1 channel audio bypass does not work.  So my conclusion is that contrary to what the manual says, the TV can only bypass 2 channel audio. I had a long discussion with tech support at Crutchfield (I bought my receiver from them). He agreed that the TV likely cannot do what the manual says it should do.I installed the TV and sound system myself. I mounted the TV on the wall and ran the cables through the wall.I have disconnected the audio cable and will leave it unused as a sacrifice to the home entertainment gods instead of trying to salvage it. I have bought two new audio cables so that I can connect the DVD player and the cable box directly to the receiver.","Date":"October 9, 2006"}

Delivery took 10 days and couldn't have gone any smoother. Eagle delivery was excellent! We were hesitant about buying such a large purchase online, but because of the price difference compared to the stores, we decided to go ahead and try it. Needless to say, we are extremely pleased. We have our TV hooked up to our new Dish Network high definition box and the picture in high def is incredible compared to a normal CRT TV. The picture is so crisp and clear that it is almost like you are there. Especially on the Discovery HD and National Geographic channels or any channel where the source was filmed in high def. Even the standard def picture is very,very good, better than expected. The TV's built in speaker sound seemed fine for us, as we have a small living room, but we use a Onkyo TX-SR604 receiver and Polk speakers almost all the time, so it doesn't really matter. The exterior of the TV is beautiful and much better than that lousy silver color that most manufacturers use. There could be a few more inputs on the back for flexibility, but the minimum of what you need is there. We have our Dish Network box sending component video and optical audio signal to our home theater receiver, and then video back to the TV and the audio out to our Polk speakers. I tried both component and HDMI cables and honestly, I did not see a difference. If you are reading these reviews trying to find the right TV just like I was two month's ago, look no further.

And I coudnt be happier.  My biggest struggle was to 1080P or not to 1080P.  But after looking at both the LN-S4051D and the LN-S4095D I just couldnt justify spending the extra money on the 1080P.  Then again I dont plan on watching Blu-Ray DVD's nor do i plan on getting a PS3.  I'm more of a sports guy, so the 1080I was a perfect fit.  The only problem i've encountered so far is the HDMI connectivity with my Scientific-Atlanta HD Cable box.  After talking to Samsung Customer service, there seems to be a problem with the TV recognizing the box via HDMI.  Apparantly (according to Samsung) there is an issue with the box and not the TV.  Of course when I called the cable company they insisted that it was the TV. Since most of the people at my cable company are idiots i'm siding with Samsung. I'm getting Directv anyway, so this issue doesnt really bother me.  With that said, I hooked up the component wires flipped on the TV and enjoyed the crisp clear image.","Date":"October 26, 2006"}

It was supposed to have a USB port. It doesn't. It also doesn't have a QAM tuner, which means it really only halfways works with cable.

Wished it had more outputs as well, as I'd like to feed video back to my PC for recording VCR tapes, etc. Makes device switching a pain.Wish I had done more research, I would probably NOT have purchased this TV, I just trusted the listing on Amazon to be accurate, which it was not.

DVD looks very good using Panasonic upconverting DVD player connected via HDMI. TV's tuner catches even fringe TV channels well.Amazon gave very good price, prompt shipping. But scheduling the home delivery was a major hassel. When the shippers received the set from Amazon/Samsung, I had to call them every single day for 1 week before getting a shipping date set that was not suitable for me. I had to arrange for someone to wait for them at home as they said they can come to my state only on one day in a week. Then they gave time of 7-10 am but arrived between 1 and 2 pm.

Logan \"KJ\"","ReviewID":"R24OM5YRLGZWG0","Overall":"good","Content":"After weeks of research at some top name stores, a friend (what a good friend he turned out to be) suggested I check out Amazon.  I decided to buy the Samsung 4051D from Amazon.  It saved me $360 on the price.  If you include no tax, I save over $500.  When looking at TVs, my wife and I would see a nice picture, walk up to the TV and it would always be a Samsung.The TV showed a great picture straight out of the box.  I have it hooked up with component cables.  I wanted to hook it up with the HDMI but my HD cable box doesn't have a HDMI output.  I called the cable company and you have to get the HD DVR to get the HDMI output.  This is my gameroom TV so I don't have a need for a DVR in that room.  Even the SD channels look good.  Some channels look close to HD quality, others look grainy.  In HD, it is awesome.  The definition and color and very good.My only disappointment was it took over a week to get the TV but for over $500 savings, it was worth the wait.  I have more time than money.Almost forgot, one feature I like about the TV is that when you scroll through the sources, it only goes to the sources that are hooked up.  You don't have to scroll through all the unused inputs.  My HD Sony (LCD Rear Projection), you have to scroll through all 8 inputs.","Date":"October 30, 2006"}

The black cabinet is so sleek and pretty, and I love that the tv has a swivel base (in our custom entertainment center we needed to be able to swivel the tv).  It looks great even when it's turned off.This tv has a great picture.  We haven't sprung for hd service yet, but even the analog looks great.  Easy to set up.  It only has two inputs for components, but I'm guessing that most people have a receiver to run them through and we are just living in 1980 or something.  The remote is easy to run, and the onscreen setup guides (to adjust color, sound etc) are easy to navigate, and that is definitely saying something.  Those are usually such a pain.The only things I would say are drawbacks are the lack of inputs, and the electronic beeping noise that this tv makes when you turn it off and on.  All in all though we are thrilled, especially for the price (when we called a major electronics retailer to see if they'd match the price for us they were floored and told us to buy it from amazon if we could get it for that price!).  We are glad that we did.  It was backordered and took nearly 6 weeks to arrive, but amazon was great with communication and we knew that when we purchased, so boo on us.This is a great tv!","Date":"March 2, 2007"}

The picture is absolutely awesome. Even in bright daylight next to a large window, the picture is very bright, and the contrast great. The power saving feature lowers the brightness for night viewing and is quite useful, especially for live sporting events that otherwise are too bright. The auto volume control works better than most others I have seen. The remote is large and easy to use, and the on screen menus are easy to use. The speakers are the only weak point, and just can't deliver the sound the picture promises, but a surround sound system is in the near future for us and should make the sound equal to the picture.

I did a ton of research, and debated this TV versus the 42'' Samsung plasma, and I could not be happier with my selection. This TV works great right out of the box, awesome picture, easy to set up, easy to navigate menus. Looks great, sounds great. One of the best purchases I've ever made.Now, the price. I can not believe how much money I saved buying this TV on Amazon (from Amazon, not a third party seller). I paid $1,879 delivered, no tax, free shipping. The after tax price at Best Buy with delivery is over $2,500. I was pretty skeptical making such a major purchase online, but the entire process was easy and uneventful. Delivery was easy to set up and the guys were prompt and courteous.All in all, I really have nothing but nice things to say about this entire buying process.

It is easily worth even $1600 or $1700.  The only downfall with the television is that the beautiful casing is extremely easy to scratch...a.k.a. be careful.The delivery process was rediculous and slow.  I had to track down two different companies that were subcontracted to handle the television on different parts of it's journey.  Long story short, my television was lost in Washington (I live in Wisconsin) where the carrier attempted to deliver my television to a gentleman who ordered a bench!!  When it did finally arrive after more than 3 weeks and countless time spent on the phone...this is where it was maddening......  A man who spoke extemely broken english rang my doorbell.  As he was trying to convince me to sign off on the delivery, his partner was unloading the television from the truck and I watched him slide the televion from the truck straight to the ground where it landed HARD on a corner of the box.  He picked the box up without a care and brought it to my doorstep where he intended to leave it.  I picked it up and carried it in my house.  Mind you, I'm 6' 2\" and 220 pounds so these two small, rude men did not intimidate me.  However, I  could not imagine this scenerio if my wife would have taken delivery instead.  These \"White Glove Delivery\" people followed me in the house and were persistent about me signing off on delivery but I intended to make sure the set worked first.  They sat on my couch as I opened the box, set things up and made sure everything worked as expected (15 minutes).  There is no way these two guys could have hooked up the television as promised by the delivery explanation.","Date":"May 13, 2007"}

The quality and features are very good.  You could spend a few hundred more if your are a purist, but I doubt that you would see much qualitative improvement. When you are looking at every pock mark and scar on a persons face in closeups, you sometimes think that maybe there is such a thing as too good.  The available media also needs to catch up with this technology.Buy the way, don't let anyone snooker you into an expensive cable.

{"Title":"Great video but sound is not so great","Author":"Chief","ReviewID":"RFGXXEAPYTBBC","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great TV for viewing HDTV channels.  It's simply amazing the quality of the picture. Viewing quality of non-HDTV channels can vary quite a bit depending on the signal.  Some are pretty bad, but others looks good. It's not the set, but just the way it is with LCDs and non-HDTV channels.  The sound is not so great, but when I want to watch a game, I plug in other speakers.  I think for the money, this set is excellent.One warning though.  If you have a problem with it, good luck getting service with Samsung.  I have a DVD recorder which died after installing the latest firmware to fix a problem with choppy video.  I've called several times, but I keep getting the \"we're experiencing an unusual volume of calls\" message (yeah sure).  I've emailed service twice, and have yet to get a response.  So I hope my relatively expensive HDTV does not have a problem, because I doubt I'll be able to get Samsung to fix it.","Date":"March 9, 2007"}

I went through all the Plasmas and LCD's in [store] before deciding on this one. This TV was one of the best looking and one of the more unique ones in the store.The TV has a circular base which lets you move it as far right or left as you'd like so no matter where you sit you can tilt it- But its so huge you probably wont need to.. You should definitely have this delivered considering the huge size and weight. Its 40 inches and its a widescreen.The TV is fairly easy to set up considering all the different features. It took me less than 10 minutes. You can connect a PC, a camcorder, and the standard things like DVD. It has everything. You can change screen sizes, freeze moving pictures, Daylight savings time, etc.. If youre looking for a very large TV with a good picture and reasonably priced then buy it. Try to buy it from Amazon and not the store because you get a better deal here. Overall, good value for the money and Highly Recommended.","Date":"January 7, 2007"}

When it came down in price to $1409 from $2199, I bought it.  I compared it to others in the same size range at local electronics stores, and thought it had the best color, contrast and sharpness available in a 40\" LCD TV.  Rather than purchasing it from a store, I decided to save $500 and take a chance on Amazon.  I'm SO glad I did!Eagle Global Logistics (EGL) delivered the TV just a week after I ordered it.  The day the TV arrived at EGL's local warehouse, I called to set up the delivery.  To be fair, EGL probably would have called me at some point.  I had heard that EGL sometimes delivers without setting up a time, and I didn't want to miss the delivery.  The company representatives I encountered were quite professional and courteous.  The delivery team brought the TV in the house, took it out of the box and helped me test it before I signed for it.  This was important because Amazon will refer buyers to the manufacturer if something goes wrong after it is received.The TV looks as beautiful as I thought it would on my HD channels.  The TV is connected by Monster HDMI cable to a digital DVR/cable box.  The channels not offered in HD were a bit of a disappointment, as Samsung claims to be able to make any signal look good.  The non-HD channels have some SLIGHT ghosting and pixelation issues.Overall, it is a fantastic TV for the price.  This was one of my largest online purchases of a single item to date.  Amazon and EGL made it a pleasure.  Now, if I could just have more channels in HD...and a Blu-Ray player....Santa?","Date":"December 7, 2006"}

In stores I always thought Samsung's looked the best and their prices, especially on amazon, fit my budget.  After reading some of the horror stories written in the review section here, I was certainly a little nervous ordering this online, but I took the plunge and I couldn't be happier.  The TV is amazing, sharp, colorful, sleek, and surprisingly easy to use (with just a few buttons you can optimize for movies, games, HDTV, and standard TV.  I can't fault the image quality at all.A word of caution, Amazon used Eagle to ship the TV to me.  I had read that it could turn out to be a real pain, so I was very proactive with them from the start.  I got the number for the nearest shipping center and tracked the package daily.  It took about a week to get from Dallas to DC, but the shipping center was open late so I picked it up myself instead of dealing with arranging a time for them to maybe show up and deliver it.  Basically, if you stay on top of it the shipping won't be a problem.Bottom line, great TV, great price, I can't believe I got this for $1400.","Date":"December 5, 2006"}

HD channels from cable source are great. At first the SD channels didn't look too good but after my cable company (Time Warner) reset the digital cable box, the SD channels improved in picture quality. Interestingly, I am only using the composite connectivity (3 RCA plugs - 2 Audio, 1 Video) and it's that good. I wonder much better will the picture quality be with HDMI connection. Since all my sources feed through a receiver (home theatre setup) that does not support HDMI or component, I am kind of stuck until receiver technology catches up. The DVD player upconversion to 720p did not have much of a difference over the non-upconversion SD DVD player. I think it's better to wait for the newer HD DVD players once the prices come down.  By the way, I have played around with the settings on the TV and found that the MOVIE mode setting is the best option.","Date":"October 25, 2006"}

It's physically beautiful, fits perfectly in my living room, and has a fantastic picture. In my opinion, the picture quality is as good as sets that cost twice as much. I'm thrilled with the brightness, color, and clarity of this LCD. And I'm glad every time I turn it on during the daytime that I didn't go with a plasma. The matte finish of this LCD shows no glare from the window on the opposite wall, something my shiny old CRT television always had a problem with. Again, I love this TV.---EDIT 12/9/06---I have noticed one weird thing as time goes on. When I zoom a standard-definition source to fill the screen, there is intermittently a horizontal line that moves through the picture. It's as if the picture is being split and the bottom half is being shifted a pixel or two to one side.

{"Title":"LCD isn't there yet","Author":"seattleguy","ReviewID":"R2LT2076WYA66D","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought one of these 40\" Samsung's last October.  The tv gets excellent picture.  The remote was easy to use and the picture settings (ie: contrast, backlight, etc) were easy to adjust.  What I discovered, however, about this tv is that it is unable to handle fast motion.  I think they call this \"ghosting\" or image lag.  I first noticed the ghosting when watching a football game.  The picture would blur when following a football in the air, such as a punt or a thrown pass.  The blurring was also noticeable while watching baskeball and watching the score ticker on ESPN.  I owned the tv for a week before deciding to take it back. From what I understand, the issue that I saw is prominent in LCDS.  Forget about what they say about refresh rate.  6ms or 8ms, doesn't matter.  There is no standard for measuring this so the refresh rate will differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, in part because they are using different methods to measure the refresh rate. If you take a look at any lcd, you'll see what I'm talking about. What I discovered is that plasmas do not have this issue.  I went out and bought the 42\" panasonic plasma instead.  It works great and I haven't had any problems.","Date":"January 25, 2007"}

{"Title":"awesome","Author":"nokia6230 \"nokia6230\"","ReviewID":"R1KUDIKWQ7ENRX","Overall":"good","Content":"I was all set to order this through amazon because I just couldn't justify paying over $400 more just to be able to pick it up (and return it if there was a problem). However, some of the bad reviews prevented me from doing so. I've had problems with shipping companies before so I know I wouldn't want to deal with that crp.I did see that one of the companies offering this tv thru  an actual brick and mortar store which was near my house so I just hopped over there, paid the tax and brought this sucker home.Of course, I did the mandatory 3 month research online and trips to the big name electronic stores ... compared it to the LG, Polaroid, and Sony. Time after time I came back to this TV. The contrast ratio and the PIP were deal breakers for me. I didn't think the contrast ratio mattered until I saw an LG with the lower ratio and the blacks looked gray. The Sony's were ok picture-wise but Samsung really gives you more bang for your buck (feature-wise).I was hoping for a 37\" because I felt a 40\" was too big but they don't make 37\" LCD's anymore. I considered the DLP but they don't make them smaller than 42\" and I just don't have enough space for that big a tv. And plus, I don't want to change the bulb every three or so years. And the option to be able to hang this on a wall was worth the price over the DLP.The only downside I couldn't get over was the inputs on the tv. It only has 1 component input and 2 rca's. Almost all the other tv's had at least 2 component inputs. But then I figured it has 2 HDMI inputs so once I upgrade my DVD player, that shouldn't matter.The speakers are weak and the treble is just waay too high. I tried adjusting it but it's a no-go. I can't wait for my surround speakers. I do, however, love the fact that they're hidden so that's a plus.All in all, it was a worthwhile purcahse. I don't know how that other guy was picking up HD channels over-the-air with his regular rabbit ears but that didn't work for me. I live 10 miles away from nyc and a cheap hdtv antenna works fine.  I race back home every night to watch shows in HD. I suggest you make the jump, too, so you can see the difference.**EDITPS. If you want to use this a computer monitor and watch your over-the-air TV it's not going to work. I bought a PIP enabled tv just for this reason and seems like it won't let me.","Date":"October 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"No longer a good deal","Author":"TV Review Freak","ReviewID":"R1FJSEUBIK7RLK","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought this in 2006 for $1,300.  Now it's floating around $1,000 on the internet.  After extensive web research, I have bought three HDTV's in the past year and am convinced that Samsung pretty much gives you the best bang for your buck when you buy on-line.Pros:Decent quality when using HD cable.Receives local HD channels with HD quality on its antenna.Lots of connections.Cons:No longer a good deal due to price drops of newer versions of this TV.Sound quality pales in comparison to LNT-4053H.Last week, I just bought the Samsung LNT-4053H for $1,100.  The picture quality is slightly better (contrast ratio of 8,000:1 vs. 4,000:1), but the sound quality is significantly better; particularly, it provides noticeably more bass. The speakers on the LNS-4041 pale very much in comparison to the LNT-4053H.If you don't mind spending just a little more, I recommend buying the LNT-4061F, as it provides much better quality (contrast ratio 10000:1 and 1080p).  Since the price of this model dropped after my purchase, I regret that I didn't wait.","Date":"December 18, 2007"}
{"Title":"Best buy out there for a 40 inch LCD","Author":"Tropical Nurse","ReviewID":"RXW3A5Z5YC4A0","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV in January, so I've had a few months to use it, and also to compare it to the LCD HDTVs that I have seen in other peoples' homes.  This TV has the best picture of any LCD of any size, by any manufacturer that I have ever seen, and I don't mean a little bit better--I mean a LOT better. I have it in my living room, and it looks great no matter what distance I sit from it. The standard def channels are as good as one could expect, and the HD channels are nothing short of breathtaking in their clarity and color. My husband and I have been watching for almost 6 months now and still say every night. \"Wow, can you believe that picture?\". The TV continues to amaze us. We can't believe what a great deal we got on it! We don't watch the standard def channels unless we have to. We're spoiled! Regular CRT sets now look really grainy and dim.The piano black frame looks so elegant. Don't worry about it being reflective. I worried about that and I've never even noticed it--it just looks beautiful in the room.I didn't have to do any tweaking of the settings--guess I was lucky. I purchased HDMI cables on Amazon for less than $5 (Cables Unlimited 6FT HDmi Cable). They arrived in two days and work perfectly. Don't pay any more for HDMI cables. You'll just be getting ripped off!There's just no room for improvement in the HD picture. It looks completely lifelike.I have the audio set up to run through a stereo (not home theater) receiver and Bose speakers. The TV sound was OK, but I did notice some vibration with bass sounds. I knew I would be using an alternative sound system, but if you're not planning to do that, the vibration might be something to think about, as I have seen other reviews that mention it.Again, the picture is superb! I was over a relative's home yesterday and they had just purchased a Panasonic 46 inch LCD. They thought it was fabulous. I felt sorry for them, thinking that they have no idea what they're missing! Everyone who comes to our home and sees the TV wants to buy one just like it, and a couple of people have done just that. They are just as happy as we are.I cannot recommend this TV enough. You will not find a better picture at any price!","Date":"June 4, 2007"}
{"Title":"Beautiful TV once you tweak it and upgrade your home theater","Author":"PulpFiction4life","ReviewID":"R276CHO9HN5M6W","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this TV back in September (8 months ago) and must say at first I was skeptical of the picture quality.  The picture on the DVD I popped in was so-so.  I started with an older less polished DVD to see what the picture would look like.  It was Goldeneye to be exact and the pixels were jagged and blurry.  Fortunately I found the issue was that my DVD player had been set up for interlaced viewing, so I changed it to the Progressive scan setting, and the picture was much better.  Very big difference from I to P...  (if you don't know the difference between 480i and 480p etc.  you should really look into the basics of HDTV before reading reviews on expensive TVs)For the price (I got it for $1650 but now it's around 1300), I was expecting more Component inputs on the TV since HDMI is still pretty new, but as it stands You'll be able to hookup your HDMI Xbox360 or PS3 no problem and the 720p looks SOO good I have to admit it's just as high def as 1080p and it's MUCH CHEAPER.  I was also surprised that the TV didn't have a coaxial output, so I had to get an Optical cable instead.  That being said, I can't really comment on the sound from the TV speakers because I use the optical output with my Sony DG800 7.1 receiver.  So I get digital surround sound from all my equipment (DVD player, Xbox 360, and Satellite HD box).  (honestly no TV cabinet should be used for sound, the audio in that little stand is pathetic compared to the big screen so match it with a big sound system.  cmon after shelling out this kind of money at least get a $300 home theater in a box)I made the leap into HD Satellite programming and I've been very pleased.  I use dishnetwork and they carry typical local channels in HD as well as your average cable channels like ESPN but they also carry the VOOM channels which are full High Definition you can tell they're crisper than even ESPN is!  I love how beautiful the picture is in High definition it's amazing and worth the upgrade if you like watching sports and movies.An interesting note for you readers, the gentleman who helped me out with the purchase was a specialist who has been selling TVs for about 4 years, and he never pushed me towards a TV I just did my research online and went into the store, and said, \"I want that one\"  and while he was ringing me up I simply asked him what kind of TV he had for himself, being a connoisseur and all and no joke he confessed he had the exact same Samsung just the 32\" little brother to the 40\".  So if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me.The original settings are okay, but as with any TV it'd be best for you to tweak it like I did, to your personal preference.  Skintones looked slightly orange so I messed around and all is well.  It's nice it keeps different picture settings for each source (i.e.  your DVD pic won't change when you mess with your game settings)I'm pleased with the TV on it's wonderful stand.  I'd recommend it to anybody interested in replacing a TV whether it's a bedroom set, or the family room TV.  Since the TV is perfectly viewable from very wide angles it'd do well in a large living room.","Date":"May 8, 2007"}
{"Title":"Awesome design, great picture quality","Author":"Rosen Filev \"Rosen Filev\"","ReviewID":"RL1WEMYL4ZMPR","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this TV for about two weeks, but I still can't stop saying \"Wow\" when I enter my living room. This is my first HDTV and I live in a comparatively small apartment, and I think this Samsung is the perfect choice for someone in my situation (especially with the drop in prices in the last year or so).I ordered th TV from Amazon - delivery was ok, TV arrived 2-3 days before scheduled. TV worked right out of the box - I had already bought the necessary cables - HDMI and audio to connect to my home theater system, and a male-to-male cable to use the TV as a monitor for my laptop. As I am not watching a lot of TV, I bought this TV mainly for watching movies on my Home Theater and all I can say is \"WOW\". The combination of the awesome picture (great resolution and colors) with the deep surround sound makes this an experience I did not even hope for. Just make sure that you have the right Home Theater to complement this TV. As for TV channels - really good picture, but I don't have any Hi-def channels, so I can't say anything there.TV itself has everything you need - two HDMI inputs, monitor input, PC input, USB port, etc. Set up was easy - actually it is all automated, so just turn the TV on and it gets started. Manual was pretty easy to follow, remote was ok - my Home Theater is also Samsung, so they are pretty similar and interchangeable.The TV also looks great when switched off - no other brand comes even closer to Samsung in design and this TV has maybe the best design ever - black \"piano\" finish, not so boxy as the other sets out there.Overall, great TV with the right add-ons - namely cables and surround system.","Date":"March 29, 2007"}

I've had this set for about  2 months. Time warner HD looks great, the standard def channels are not great, but not so bad you can't watch it. The speakers do buzz a little with deep loud sound. You have to keep in mind that they are completely hidden and the sound this set puts out is actually really good. I sit about 15 feet away and everything is wonderful. the menu is easy to work, took me 15 minutes to set up. I used some advice  from some of the \"tech-nerds\" from AVS forum and that really helped with settling on picture quality. I would recommend the OPPO upconvert DVD player with DCDi. Its an amazing piece of equipment and really makes those standard def DVD's look more vibrant and closer to HD than just standard progressive sonys. The OPPO plays all of my DVD backups. I was leary and did all sorts of research on T.V.'s and unless you really need 1080P then i'd go with this bad boy. 1080P looks good, but keep in mind if you blow up regular cable signals to a even higher resolution the picture is really bad. But on the other hand the HD looks superb. Happy hunting and if you want great quality with a not over the top price the lns4051d is a great choice.","Date":"February 9, 2007"}

Otherwise, I'd have to take off from work to be home to sign for the delivery. Note that Eagle could not have called me to make delivery arrangements because Amazon did not provide my telephone number to them - if I didn't call Eagle, I don't know how they'd make arrangements to delivery the TV without further delay, so do acknowledge the caveat.When I spoke to the dispatcher in charge of local delivery, to make delivery arrangements, I also asked her about the responsibilities of the delivery men. She advised me that they will unbox the TV, place it on your furniture and take the box with them (if you wish). They will not mount the TV to the wall, and they will not wait for you to turn it on to check its operation.The delivery men were courteous and careful.They called me about half an hour in advance of the delivery, and had it in my house 45 minutes before the close of the \"delivery window\" (9AM-1 PM).I purchased the TV when Amazon had it listed for $1299.99, now it is more -lucky me.My Directv has not yet been upgraded to HD, yet I'm receiving gorgeous off-the-air transmissions using the Zenith Indoor HDTV Antenna(sold through Amazon, of course, and also received very quickly). The cable from this antenna is plugged into the Directv receiver \"air in\" antennareceptacle. The Zenith Antenna did NOT work when I attached its' cable directly to the \"air in\" antenna receptacle on the TV. Live and learn.I simply can't fathom how much more beautiful the images can be with HD - but I'll find out at the end of the month when Directv upgrades my system.I have no problems with the speakers rattling, as some few others claim.The TV is beautiful without even being turned on. It's a super-shiny black with \"good lines\" - a good companion to my Ford Ranger Edge, come to think of it (and my Black Labrador Retriever).Thanks to Amazon, Samsung and Eagle Airfreight !UPDATE: After awhile it dawned on me that the volume needed to be increased from the maximum offered. Fortunately, there's an \"AUDIO OUT\" capabilty, so I ordered a \"ZVOX\" from Amazon and it has worked wonderfully.","Date":"January 17, 2007"}

What I do not know yet is if it is my cable service, or if I just have not found the right settings on the picture settings of the TV, but either way I did not have the 'Wow' factor I expected with this, my first high definition TV.","Date":"May 16, 2007"}

The picture quality is great, even without HDTV. The sound is good for the built-in speakers. My one complaint would be the remote control. You must point the remote directly at the center of the TV for it to work.I looked at several TVs before purchasing this one and noticed Samsung consistently had the best overall picture. I do recommend spending a little extra to purchase some high-quality cables so you can get the most out of this TV. Everyone who comes to my house always says something about the TV. Those who watch it, love the clear picture.Of course, this isn't a 1080p TV. However, I couldn't justify spending the money a 1080p TV cost. Especially, when the HD-DVD players cost so much.Overall, for the price the picture on this TV is excellent as well as the design. Samsung LNS4051D 40\" LCD HDTV","Date":"May 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great flat panel tv!","Author":"C","ReviewID":"R1Y2ZGXJRJ2ZJ8","Overall":"good","Content":"After extensive research I decided to go for this lcd. The price was within my budget and this tv was perfect for the space in my house. I have a lot of light in my living room and the lcd screen is perfect. No glare from the windows for me! This would have been a big issue for me if I bought a plasma tv. The screen quality is great even with regular cable service. The channels are all clear. I like the menu screen too--it does not completely block the whole screen and its easy to operate. The 'piano look' gives the lcd a sleek look, and the stand it comes with is an added bonus--it swivels from right to left. It needs some tweaking once its out of the box, however, its preset viewing settings are a good start. I switch between dynamic and movie settings depending on what I am watching. This is a good tv for the price I got it for on Amazon. Eagle delivered the tv intact and within the stated delivery period. I just kept track of the shipment and called the local office to make sure that they had all the information they needed to get to my house. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.","Date":"May 10, 2007"}

The component and PC inputs give a clear sharp picture with bright colors/whites and dark darks.  Easily used as a PC monitor with a crisp display.Cons:Only 1 component input.  The sound quality from the speakers is poor, and gives a crackling noise even at low levels.  Sometimes the darks can be a little too dark.Overall:This is a great tv for the price.  The 40\" widescreen measures the same screen height as our previous 32\" tube tv, so no size is lost when watching regular definition tv.","Date":"April 29, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great TV","Author":"Nicholas Ledoux \"I love to Rock\"","ReviewID":"R27YJI8C8BHSY6","Overall":"good","Content":"This was the first HDTV I bought, and I am very happy with my purchase. I use this TV to play Xbox360 and watch HD-DVD's with the add-on. It's amazing to watch the new high-definition dvd's on the TV. I also have HD-cable through Comcast, and although the signal isn't as good as an HD-DVD, it still looks great. Standard definition cable doesn't look that great, but thats what you should expect when you get a TV with higher resolutions. Opt for digital or HD cable. Regular DVDs still look good though, so don't worry about that.Playing the 360, the TV is flawless. I use the game mode while playing Oblivion, Gears of War, even Halo 2. The TV just does everything I expected it to do. I am eventually going to hook my gaming PC up to it through the VGA connector, but as of right now I am having trouble finding a long enough VGA cord for the right price.I gave the TV 4 stars instead of 5 because of the User interface and remote. The remote is slow to react to my button pushes, and the menu interface isn't the best either. A remote can be replaced (try the Harmonix remotes), but the menu system is stuck there. Some options are hidden away. The game mode option is under setup category instead of picture. The brightness option is hidden in power management instead of just being called brightness.At the end of the day though, when I got used to the menu navigation, I just love this TV. I think Samsung has a customer for life now whenever I upgrade TVs.I also want to point out that Amazon did a tremendous job with Eagle USA shipping (look it up as EGL shipping). They delivered the TV right to my house, brought it in and opened it up for me. They waited for me to turn it on and make sure it worked to my liking, and they even took the garbage from the packaging with them as they left. 5 Stars for the delivery (which was free also).","Date":"April 15, 2007"}

Approximately a month ago I purchased the Samsung LNS4051D 40\" inch TV at very low price. ie, compared to the local electronic stores.  The TV shows an awesome picture as was advertised. The TV was delivered free to my apartment earlier than expected. The delivery people brought the TV into my apartment and unboxed it. The instructions to set up the TV were not the best but okay.  Within 15 minutes I was watching beatiful HD programs on my Samsung TV. (Note I already had HD service from my cable company).  By the way, the Amazon salespeople were helpful, knowledgeable and courteous.  At first I was reluctant about purchasing the TV over the internet.  However they made they made me feel at ease.There is so much more good things that I could say about my purchase but I have to go.

I was considering other ~40\" sets including LG, Sony, and Sharp.  Although Samsung might not display the best HD I think overall it is the best set if you consider price (I paid ~1,300), HD quality, and non-hd quality.  I specifically bought this set because of the other reviews I have read about its ability to show non-HD channels in great quality.  It didn't disappoint.  My friend owns a 46\" Sharp Aquos and I can honestly say I didn't like the way the regular channels came out on it.  I did have to adjust the color settings on the Samsung but I think you'll have to do that on any other set anyways.  It also has no problems with bright or dark rooms as I've tried both.  Overall I am very happy and will probably buy another for my bedroom soon.","Date":"March 8, 2007"}

Needed 40\" w/swivel base, so was between Sony and Samsung. Did not need 1080P, a waste for my purposes.  Most web reviews and big box techies preferred picture of Samsung, and it also has 2 HDMI imputs (may add DVD upconverter later), vs one for Sony. Side-by-side I liked the Samsung, incl the shiny black piano finish.  And less expensive.  Got a great price from Amazon/ Electronic Express; ordered Saturday, shipped Monday, arrived Wednesday with delivery window coordinated. I already have a theater, this one basically for living room and HD cable.  Had to get the HD/DVR (Scientific Atlanta) to get HDMI connection, HD box alone does not have it.  Simple hook-up with just the HDMI cable. Fabulous HD pic; still playing with SD settings.  Sound is fine for my purposes. Also got the Cables to Go HDMI 2M cable for $20.  Can't imagine the expensive Monster Cables (which I have in theater for analog signals) could provide a better pic/sound. Monster well made but gross overkill for digital signals. We are really enjoying this HDTV (especially football!) and the simplicity of operation.","Date":"November 24, 2006"}

I'm a pretty good researcher when it comes to this type of item and I might say that I was on the money with this item too.  (thats my horn you hear). Seriously the picture is better than I would have thought. The most amazing thing is when I installed this to my antenna, the HD picture I get is unbelievble. I have a standard antenna in my attic, with a signal booster in line. Nothing I had was for HD. My signal was acceptable before, and when you look at the  channels in regular mode they are still acceptable.  A friend was over and he had to look at the hookup because he didn't believe I had it only hooked up to the antenna. The pundants say you must have a HD antenna, I can't imagine the picture could get any better than it is now.  My wife and I watched some DVD's we have and it was like seeing a whole new movie because of the definition.I have a Mitsubishi large screen 50 inch projection tv with Direct TV.  The picture on this Samsung is heads and shoulders above the Mitsubishi even when its on the satellite.I will agree with the people on here about the sound. It could be better, but if you play with the equalizer you can get it pretty good.The only problem was with the infomation supplied from amazon and the actual shipping. It arrived when they said it would , but in the meantime every person I emailed from amazon  had a different answer and that my TV was being shipped to a different city. It was aggravating, but it arrived OK.More importantally, pay attention to the selling price on Amazon after you buy. As it goes down which it has twice for me since 11-1. You notify Amazon that you've noticed this , they will credit your credit card the difference.","Date":"November 22, 2006"}
