However, the screen quality is clearly inferior to the Pro version and the lack of matte option is a shame.There are indeed many pluses going for this new iteration of the MacBook.  Unfortunately however, there are far more minuses.  Already mentioned is the noticeably inferior screen (this a a major flaw as the screen is the primary interface to the computer as it is through this that you will be look at all the time).  The purposeful omission of the FW port is just plain stupid.  This severely cripples the versatility of the Mac.  The price, another major factor, is just ridiculous.Stay away from this version and buy the next one when Apple brings FW back as well as a decent screen with a matte option.","Date":"November 22, 2008"}

Apples are nice for those who like flashy graphics and have the luxury of paying extra money and time to send their computers off to Applecare, or like to deal with corporate types when dealing with simple issues. (God forbid a problem arises after three years)I have switched over to an HP laptop, and it performs just as well, if not better than any Apple that I have ever used.

Two points make it absolutely unusable:The screen isn't only a glossy screen: its a hyper-ultra-mega-glossy screen, since a glass plate is mounted on top of the glossy screen. It's almost impossible to not be distracted by reflections when working with it, which causes eye-strain, fatigue, and maybe more serious ocular problems. Now, if you want to do your make-up or shave while working, this computer might be a good choice.Then of course, this computer is unusable for anybody making serious audio or video, or event just wants to use multiple speedy harddisks. Not only would that person have to sell all his Firewire equipment and by their USB2 equivalents (when they actually exist), he also would have to settle for far inferior technology, and suffer all the problems that come with the USB port versus Firewire: glitches, bottlenecks, asynchronicity, CPU strain etc. etc.Think twice before buying this computer: you may not use Firewire now, but will need it soon. You may not notice the glare and reflections of the glossy screen now, but you will feell the headaches and fatigue constantly having to reajust your vision sooner or later.Conclusion: a seductive but deceptive object, good to show off but not for work.","Date":"October 28, 2008"}
{"Title":"$1600, Yet No FireWire?","Author":"Your Role Model","ReviewID":"R1DGWEZXG3WN8V","Overall":"bad","Content":"In a few ways, the new metal MacBooks are actually an improvement over the last-gen MBs... aluminum is nicer-looking (IMO) than the previous white plastic, there's a more solid-feeling keyboard, new LED-backlighting on an all-glass screen (highly glossy though- reflection-and-fingerprint-city), new multitouch gesturing (like the iPhone) on a new all-glass trackpad that IS the button now (the whole trackpad 'clicks'- some will like this, some won't), and somewhat better graphics performance (though still far from hardcore gamer standards).But Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the high price point. Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and various Firewire-to-whatever adapters or hubs, present or future, are not solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can.These folks are now stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000 & up), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Book model, still around at $1000, with FireWire- though these will likely be discontinued pretty soon.The screen is also a bit disappointing, with a very limited viewing angle and far-from-the-best blacks and contrast.Bottom line: It's a quite pretty new MacBook with some nice minor upgrades and clever touches, but a less-than-great screen and one huge downgrade that didn't need to happen. Also, at $1600, it's quite expensive, even for the MacBook line.If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's certainly fine. But, isn't much of the reason why MacBooks are WORTH the price premium the fact that you can do darn near ANYTHING with 'em? Not anymore.Prosumers will be especially disappointed, as Apple is expecting them to shell out quite a lot of money for a notebook that doesn't really support what they want to do anymore.","Date":"October 21, 2008"}

The battery cover is very loose (so is 2 of my friends), it dents and scratches easily with just a regular watch I had on and placed on a wooden table, and the screen/graphics while a little better than the previous Macbook, isn't a lot better.  It seems like Apple rushed this out and didn't take the time to build it with quality in mind.  I spent a great deal of money on this, but the previous Macbook 2.4 for the same amount of money has a lot more power in benchmark tests than this one.  It has no firewire power which is really stupid.  Even a $500 Dell has that.  The previous Macbook had it.  My friends already has 2 stains on his palm rest which will not come out.I can't recommend this computer to anyone and that is sad because I'm a big fan of Apple products and have 2 other computers by them.  I have a black Macbook and a iMac.  I'm returning this to Apple and will just use my black Macbook which is better in my opinion anyways.Apple quality has taken some strong hits lately.

I bought a 13.3\" Macbook upgraded with the best available processing and memory.  Right out of the box, the thing looked beautiful and sleek.  I switched it on and that's where the fun stopped.  The MacBook and OS Leopard make Microsoft products seem efficient, intuitive, and logical by comparison. I've had mine a month now, and I'm a reasonably intelligent person, so it is fair to say I've given it all the chance an average person should.  I look forward to using it as a $2K aluminum frisbee very soon.  Examples:I recently spent a 4-hour cross-country flight trying to get the word processor to let me expand the default working window from 5\" to a more full=screen adult size.  But you can't do that.  Apparently MacApple also doesn't want you to be able to re-name files, or move them around among folders.  Even deleting them is not a one-key process, you have to drag them here, drag them there, play miniature golf with them, just to get them in the \"trash.\"But backing up a couple of weeks; right out of the box, most programs started out with some kind of error message.  \"Hold on there, you can't do that, who do you think you are\"  So I had to burrow dep into the settings and preferences to try to reset things to get Garage Band, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes etc, to run at the basic level.  And oh by the way, all \"Help\" menus are online, so you must be connected to the internet to use them.  That's a problem when your problem is that the MacBook won't connect to the internet.  So there went another weekend for me,  wandering through settings and preferences in weirdly arranged menus, trying to set the computer to the most obvious basic settings to get it online.  What sold me on Macs was the reputation that everything about them is \"plug and play.\"  My experience is that almost nothing is.Now it won't let me send emails while I'm on the road.And the trackpad is going bad, after 4 weeks of service.When the CD drive ejects a disc, it sounds like somebody folding a CD jewel case in their hands until it snaps into pieces.  I sense big trouble in there soon.So: I spent big money experimenting with the switch from PC to Mac.  I used to keep a Bill Gates Voodo doll on my desk, sticking pins in it everytime I ran into some typical PC dysfuncion.  But now Apple has made me a big fan of PCs.  I'll be going back.The backlit keyboard is nice, and the glossy screen is not the problem other reviewers suggest.  The real problems with this product are not those superficial things.  The real problems are inside.Run, do not walk, away rom this product.","Date":"May 9, 2009"}

USB floppy drives and usb to ABD adapters that protected your investment.

But somehow, in a VERY puzzling decision, Apple managed to give with one hand and take away with the other, by eliminating FireWire from the new MetalBooks.Apple's removal of Firewire is a real (and very unnecessary) kick in the teeth, especially at the $1300 point (medium for *Apple*, but high for Windows switchers, who are about 50% of Apple's clientele these days).Besides losing Target Mode and super-easy file migration, many ppl with expensive Firewire-only video cameras and/or audio equipment are being left in the lurch by this, and USB 2 and Firewire-to-whatever adapters/hubs are not real solutions, as they can't do all the things Firewire can.These folks are stuck with either having to move up to the very pricey MacBook Pro (at $2000+), or settling for the old 'Plastic'Books, still around at $1000 with FireWire (though probably not for much longer).Some ppl will also dislike the lack of a matte screen option- while it's nice that the screen is now LED-backlit and made of glass, it's also verrry glossy now, with all the annoying glare and fingerprints that that entails. Also, the viewing angle is surprisingly narrow, and the screen doesn't have very good blacks or contrast, which is disappointing for a laptop in this price range.All in all, this is a quite pretty MacBook with some clever touches/minor upgrades, but one huge downgrade that did not need to happen, plus a less-than-stellar screen.If all you plan to do with it is Internet, email, productivity apps and playing Starcraft 2 or WoW, then it's fine.

At the time I knew nearly nothing about computers (buying or using)Some how i fell upon this Compaq presario and the price wasn't too unreasonable at $600 so i went for it.  The first bump in the road occured after the first month when i realized after about 25 \"practice uses\" for windows vista i was unable to use it anymore. In my haste i didn't bother entering my product key (located under the notebook) to make Vista official.  I also use my compaq stationary on my desk and kept it plugged in, so i never really realized the heat this thing gives off, and it DOES get HOT. So after some reading into it i bought a laptop cooler to prevent damage from overheating and whatnot. the fan can get rather loud as well(presumably from working so hard trying to keep it cool).  I had no problems connecting, and the few times it did have trouble, i shut it down, reset my wireless router and it was back up, so not the computers fault. I did notice that every so often Internet explorer will stop working(Not Responding) in the middle of use, resulting in opening task manager and closing the window. This doesn't happen an overwhelming amount, but enough to take notice.  Lastly(just a personal thing)the outside tends to get VERY smudgy. It's very slick looking when its clean, but easily leaves fingerprints.Not a BAD computer, could be cooler, literally, and quieter, and my review probably could've been improved if i had been more knowledgable about the purchasing and the components of a good computer in the first place :P","Date":"May 26, 2009"}

A few months later the computer kept shutting down.  Here the motherboard was running so hot, it shut itself down so the motherboard would not fry.  Upon inspecting the machine, the fan vent is on the bottom.  A not-so-bright design if I may say so.  My fix is to use it on a cookie cooling rack.  So now, wherever my 'portable' laptop goes, the cookie rack follows.A few months after that, the cursor would jump around whenever I typed with my palms resing next to the mouse pad.

{"Title":"There's hot and then there's hot","Author":"Mark","ReviewID":"R1H95M31PHTPQG","Overall":"good","Content":"I really like this laptop. Performance wise it is really good - much better than I expected. The HP install of additional software is minorly intrusive, but it's easy to disable or uninstall the stuff that I didn't want. I use it as a general purpose laptop for accessing the internet, reading email, and watching videos. It fits my needs well. I've been able to successfully install Ubuntu Linux on the device, with the assistance of this link: [...]. All features work correctly.I paid $[...] for it (after $[...] in [...]). So from a price/performance perspective, that's one kind of hot.But then there's another kind of hot. The devices generates extremely high temperatures. So high that I am concerned that the device will fry itself.I use speedfan to monitor temperatures. The GPU seems to be parked at 110C, the CPU is typically above 60C sometimes going into the 70's and 80's, and the HD is usually around 55C sometimes spiking above 60C. The GPU and HD temp seem excessive to me: especially the HD. I just purchased a laptop cooler to deal with this (not yet arrived).I occasionally need to leave the device running overnight (e.g. in order to complete a backup). In order to do this, I have to close the screen, and lean it against a wall so that the bottom side is exposed to open air. If I do that, the temps for GPU, CPU & HD fall back into much more reasonable ranges (GPU<100C, CPU<60C & HD<50C).I am hoping that the laptop cooler that I bought will significantly help with the cooling of this device. However, without the cooler, I am concerned that I will fry the device very quickly. So, for now, I'm not leaving it run for long periods of time. This, of course, limits it's usefulness. I would have given this a 5-star review except for this heat problem. Which is bad enough to drop the review down to 3-star.Summary:Pros:* Performance* Price (my price)* HP Windows install is good & non-intrusive* Linux compatibleCons:* Hot (by far my biggest concern)* Battery life is low - I get about 90 minutes* The case is a fingerprint magnetUPDATE: Wow, what a difference a working fan makes. I connected with HP via their online chat about the heating problem. They sent me a box and a shipping label for repair. I dropped it off at FedEx on Monday and had it back on Friday. They replaced the fan. And now, the normal usage temps are: GPU 104C, CPU 58C, HD 49C. These are all *much* more reasonable.As a consequence, I have changed my review to 5 stars.  Note however, that I got a great price for this.  Much less than the price advertised on amazon when this review was written.  I would rate this much lower at that price.UPDATE2: HP removed the screws from the hard drive in order to replace the fan.  But they didn't put them back in, causing the drive to unseat itself and disconnect. At least one screw is needed to keep that harddrive from easily falling out of it's connector.  Bad form, HP!  When I called them back, I had to haggle with them to send me some screws.  They wanted me to send the entire laptop back in.","Date":"March 16, 2009"}

Granted, it is on it's last leg and if I had more patience, I could deal with all of its little issues like:1. having to contort the power cord into balloon animal shapes at the entrance to the jack and held in place with whatever is handy to actually get the thing to charge2. The battery holds about 5 minutes worth of energy3. the track pad only works if you use your WHOLE finger, not tip, whole. This makes fine tasks difficult but is easily solvable with a wireless mouse4. Some of the keys are starting to give out-one being the S, which is unfortunate as my name has 4 of them in it5. The fact that you could cook an egg on the palm rest after being on for more than 10 minutes. It is so HOT!! It will play a video (from any source) for about 1.5 minutes before the screen shuts off. The only way to get it back on is to force shut down with the power button, wait for it to cool off and then turn it back on. I have been able to get around this by setting the laptop on these really thick coasters (bench cookies)to increase the airflow underneath. When I must watch a video for school, a small bag of peas or a couple of burritos over the keyboard have kept it from over heating.So, even with all of that, I am writing this review from this laptop purchased 4 years ago. I have every intention of getting a new one in the next month but Ole Betty here has been able to assist me with:writing my thesispreparing presentationsgoing on mypace (back when that was cool)playing Guitar Hero (it skipped until I turned off all the background crap and then it was fine)playing music (duh)streaming NetflixFacebooking (is that a verb now?)wasting unimaginable time on the internetI felt I owed a review to this machine for being part of my life for the past 4 years.","Date":"October 16, 2012"}

I was interested to see a HP/Compaq hybrid after reading Compaq had been bought out by HP but I was expecting a much better notebook.  This note-book has horrible performance just like the old Compaq presario I used to have.  Had the same screen issues that my old Compaq had and also possesses the same horrible crashing that my old compaq had.  SO I guess HP just took the failed design of the old Compaq systems and re-shipped them.  This is proabally why just before they were bought by HP, Compaq had the lowest ratings and test scores of any brand it all catagories.  Not all Compaq's are bad, my releationship with the Compaq systems is they work or they don't, which I was no where near satisfied with.","Date":"December 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"HP Pavilion DV5-1003nr: A Nightmare without Support","Author":"David M. Dickerson","ReviewID":"RPSMBUH4V6COC","Overall":"bad","Content":"PRODUCT STATUS: Although HP still makes some Pavilion DV-5-series notebooks, the DV5-1003nr is discontinued in late 2008/early 2009. (If you are interested in this notebook, you should find excellent pricing on this particular model, because it is no longer being manufactured, but is a recent product and updates for drivers, firmware, and software are still available from Hewlett-Packard's Web site.In August 2008, I received a new HP Pavilion DV5-1003NR notebook as an unexpected gift. I had been looking for a factory-refurbished IBM ThinkPad, two to four years old, with not operating system installed, because I planned to run Linux on the notebook. ThinkPads have become a favorite of Linux users because of their compatibility, durability, and reliability -- and I personal find that widescreen displays (which seem to be the norm for standalone and notebook/laptop displays) adversely hinder my productivity, because the work that I do makes vertical screen space more valuable than extra width.My DV5-1003nr notebook (officially an \"HP Pavilion DV5 Entertainment Notebook PC\") came with 4-GB of RAM, 1-GB more than the default, although the unit preshipped with a 32-bit, OEM version of Vista Home Premium SP1 (which cannot take advantage of 4-GB of RAM); a retail, boxed 32-bit Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate Upgrade (which was over $200 at the time, but was purchased because the Best Buy salesperson told \"my benefactor\" that Vista Ultimate make full use of the 4-GB of RAM (which, of course, is not true of the 32-bit version -- but was the reason for the purchased of a 2-GB SoDIMM to replace the 1-GB soDIMM occupying one of the two memory slots) and stated that HP \"should have no problem with the upgrade\" and that, if the notebook was purchased with Best Buy's 2-year extended protection plan (which it was) that the upgrade from HP's OEM version of Vista Home Premium (without installation or recovery discs) to a Vista Ultimate was compatible with the extended service plan.NOTE: My particular unit was assembled in Chine in May 2008 with a defective AMD processor. The notebook could not load Windows Vista the first time that I turned it on (which should have been a red flag to return the unit immediately for an exchange or, ideally, a refund). Because the computer was new, I had to keep refusing the Startup Repair option to select a recent restore point (and I was not offered the recovery option, presumably because Vista had not yet loaded and had not yet added the recovery partition as a boot option): After an hour, Vista loaded, but a growing barrage of errors and lockups started. I created two recovery DVDs on Maxell's best DVR-R data discs as soon I as was prompted to do so during the setup process. (This process took several hours.) I tried using the recovery partition and the recovery DVDs that I used to restore the computer to factory condition, but was trapped in an endless cycle -- and HP support totally ignored my support requests for three months. Because I have built all of my computers myself (except for the Macs), I kept trying to resolve the cascading problems myself, out of habit, but realized that I should used Best Buy's 2-year extended protection plan.A technician from the Geek Squad at the store where the notebook was purchased called me two days after I dropped off the computer, stating that the HP had built the notebook with a defective CPU, and that he'd seen symptoms of \"motherboard issues\" before the diagnostic software and computer crashed. I approved shipping the computer to a service center for repair, and the technician told me that he expected the motherboard with the CPU would be replaced. When the notebook arrived back at the store in three weeks, I was upset to learn that the hardware was not mentioned  in the report (except in the condition comments, which stated that the unit showed no signs of wear or abuse) and that no repairs were performed: Vista was reinstalled because of \"one missing and one corrupt system file, but all is well now.\" The extended coverage has a \"no lemons\" clause, but Best Buy will replace a computer only after \"four valid repairs,\" and installations are not considered repairs. I have not yet found a way to escape this trap.I contacted HP CEO Mark Hurd about my lack of support and was assigned a case manager who was was less than helpful and subjected me to verbal abuse and insults every time that I called him (and he never called me). My notebook came with a single-fan cooling mat, which I recommend for all notebook and laptop computer users, and I had always used it. My first unit had a tilt feature and I put the notebook in my lap for two seconds to adjust the tilt. During that time I jumped in as a reflex to an intense burning sensation, although I managed to catch the notebook before it hit the floor. The redness and pain (through thick denim jeans) last for three days. During a conversation with my HP case manager, I had mentioned my concerns about the heat and that the CPU typically runs at 70-72 degrees Celsius (roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit or more) and he laughed and said, \"they do run hot, don't they!?\" -- and he evaded my query of how he could help me resolve the problem. I then described my injury and my HP case manager told me that the burn was MY responsibility, because \"HP actually makes a distinction between a laptop and a notebook computer; you put a notebook in your lap, and a notebook is NOT a laptop.\" My case manager became irate when I stated that his job was to resolve my problems, per Mark Hurd's wishes, not entangle me in semantics -- and he started to rant and was unintelligible, so I quietly hung up the phone.I have contacted Geek Squad's CI, Robert Stephens, whom I hope can intervene, but -- after two more messages to Mark Hurd's office -- I missed a phone call from someone in the HP executive department, but -- based upon HP's ever-dropping service ratings (and the fact that I returned a new scanner that died after three months and received a filthy refurbished unit with felt pen marks scrawled around the control buttons) -- I am hoping that Robert Stephens can end this message, but I also have 30 days before my HP warranty expires (which I have honored, not installing the Vista Ultimate upgrade because I was told it would instantly void my warranty), and if Robert Stephens does not contact me soon, I must contact HP, although I have been deceived, ignored, and fully expect HP to allow the warranty to expire.PRODUCT OVERVIEW: Hewlett-Packard's series of wide-screen, shiny metallic and black, entertainment series of notebook computers is not intended for business use (for which its design is not intended or suited). I would describe the HP Pavillion DV5 series as \"a portable DVD player for people who do casual computing for short periods of time.\"The plastic (silver or bronze, depending on one's model) keys are so reflective that I struggle to see the characters. If I start typing \"gibberish\" and need to reposition my hands in the correct touch-typing position, the process strains my eyes and wastes time. The Synaptics TouchPad (which is actually metal) is difficult to customize and the two buttons require undue pressure and are very loud. (I recall thinking that I broke the switches several times.) The screen may be popular with people who view DVDs on the computer, but the reflective, glass-like surface generates glare that literally gives me double- and triple-vision and causes my eyes to burn. Focusing has become a problem even when I am not using the notebook's display, and I actually visited my ophthalmologist four months after getting this notebook, convinced that I needed a new eyeglass prescription. (I also use an external keyboard and mouse, although I cannot afford an external monitor.)If you decide to purchase a Pavilion DV5-1003NR, make certain that you purchase a new unit with a full warranty. Based upon my Web searches, and the growing number of Web sites such as HPLies.com, I suggest that you purchase a third-party, extended service plan from a trusted provider at the same time that you purchase any HP computer -- although my experience with HP, sadly, is not unique, and I suggest that you do not purchase any HP desktop, laptop, or notebook computers -- or any product that might require support.Consumer Reports and other independent organizations have published comparisons of OEM computer manufacturers, based upon quality of product and quality of service and support. I \"shot myself in the proverbial foot,\" because I was so used to building and troubleshooting my own computers. I suspect that bare-bones laptop and notebook computers and/or kits will be available in the future, but most computer users prefer to purchase a computer that works and for which they can get friendly and prompt, responsive service.Finally, even if my particular unit were not built with a defective CPU, overheating is a problem that is plaguing HP notebooks -- Intel and AMD -- beyond the models that have had recalled batteries, which were the causes of the overheating. Heat and dust will always be enemies of computers, but small, powerful computers -- and many people use laptop computers as their only computer -- lack the space for air to flow or additional fans that help cold desktop computers. (Of course, additional fans are not a viable cooling option for notebook computers, because of their adverse effect on battery life.)I am sure that my serious hardware defect is an exception, although it is my first (and last) experience with AMD processors, but Hewlett-Packard has a verifiable record of poor quality, poor or nonexistent support, and the deception and abusive treatment of customers that I have experienced.'Caveat emptor'!Cordially,DavidP.S. -- Like many reviewers, I would like to give this product and HP a rating of zero stars, but one star is the minimum rating that I can give! :-)","Date":"July 1, 2009"}

Though it is vista, I have not had any problems.  The 3 gigabytes of ram are plenty for vista.

I do not play video games with this computer (only simple games like the ones from addictinggames.com), so I don't know how good it is for that (it is not meant to be a gaming computer), but it is good for watching TV and movies online.

{"Title":"Non ergonomic design, lack of LED displays, heavy machine","Author":"Think before u buy","ReviewID":"RS6MFPV868S7V","Overall":"bad","Content":"While performance of T500 is not bad, it has several flaws for anyone looking for a solid Biz machine and typing on in for hours.  First, the keyboard location/palm rest space is non-ergnonimic and will lead to wrist pain for anyone with medium to large palms. With mouse pad and related related clickable fields taking extra space, loudspeakers on the top taking space, there is not enough space to rest your palms - they end up resting on the edges and slipping off - putting pressure on your wrist area. This can lead to Carpal tunnel syndrom. Second, the location or finger reader is awkward - just under where you keep your hands instead on the side. Thrid, the weight of above 6lbs speaks against T500.  Another major flaws is that are no LED displays above 1280 resolution,  For serious user, better options are Dell E6500, and perhaps Apple until HP comes up with new series of laptops with LED displays.","Date":"July 6, 2009"}

{"Title":"It's a good laptop","Author":"Mikey Mike \"Zoom Lover\"","ReviewID":"R2T2ODRIBYV8J2","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought mine in August 2008. It comes with Vista 64-bit but I found that some programs I wanted to install would not so I installed Vista 32-bit (CD & instructions were included when I bought mine). It does not have a S-video outlet(I miss it). I have not figured out how to connect it to my TV yet without S-video. After changing from 64-bit to 32-bit I had some minor issues reinstalling the drivers. I had to call GATEWAY SUPPORT. My problem was taken care of. I recently noticed that when I use any equalizer on any music player (Win. I-Tunes. Jet Audio etc) the music level goes down instead of up when I increase the settings. WEIRD!! I'm in the process of trying to fix that bug. The lay out of the KEY BOARD is not standard. The ENTER & BACKSPACE buttons are smaller than usual and I keep hitting the buttons next to them. The CTRL & ALT buttons are not where I'm used to having them on other boards. It has a 3-pronged power cord so make sure your outlets are 3-pronged receptables. It could be a problem when traveling on the road. Other than that I have no other problems with it.I love this laptop. It's very fast, graphics are crisp, resolution is great. Not too heavy just ove 6.3 lbs. This is also my first year using VISTA so some of it has to do with the difference between VISTA & XP.I recomend this laptop but if you change from 64 bit to 32 bit be prepared for some WTF momments. Oh by the way I tried to put XP on it but GATEWAY says they do not support XP on it. I could not get XP to install.I guess if I was a geek I could find ways around it.","Date":"January 19, 2009"}

The built-in wireless adapted sometimes needs to be restarted (there is a switch on the side -- turn it on and off to restart the wireless, not a big deal at all), but I only noticed that this needs to be done after the system comes out of hibernation.

The touch-pad decides when it does and doesn't want to work, which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating.  Sometimes it will just decide that it wants to turn off, and it does, without warning.  Finally, it cannot understand how to find and maintain an internet connection.  I have an old powerbook (mac) that can find and connect to wireless twice as fast as this brand new laptop, that comes pretty highly rated.  I run Vista business (required at my law school) so maybe that is part of it, but it certainly can't be all of it.

{"Title":"Great for a while but not made to last","Author":"littlewhitewolf","ReviewID":"R1PFM5LH3TAOYP","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this computer for a year and a half and was happy with it up until recently. I am a graduate student and when I first got this computer it had exactly what I needed and did everything wonderfully and in some ways still does. I was completely impressed by this computer. It was fast at completing all tasks when I got it and a year later after much usage and lots of space taken up it is still just as fast. It's a beautiful, sleek looking computer and it comes with a lot of great features. It has small lights that act as buttons at the top of the keyboard you lightly put your finger on and they do tasks such as launching itunes, muting audio, and playing/stopping/fastforwarding movies so you don't have to navigate to other windows or the desktop to complete tasks. It also has labelflash which is useful if you want custom labeled dvd's. I have burned hundreds of dvds and cds with this computer and have never had any problems and the burner is still going strong. I've never had any issues connecting to wireless internet and have even used this computer to connect to other computers wirelessly to transfer documents. I can have multiple windows and tabs open and it doesn't effect the speed of the computer. I can run games easily and it plays programs flawlessly. It has three usb outlets and I am able to run a usb mouse, a printer, and a usb disk at the same time if I need to. This computer in many ways is great.It does have its not so great points though and the main one is that its parts broke down fast. Around three months after I got this computer I started having issues with the screen flickering. At first it only did it on rare occasions so I didn't think much about it, but after while, after it was too late for returns, it flickered worse and worse. Four months ago I couldn't move the laptop from my desk for fear of flickering. The screen eventually went out and I had to replace it. It's been three months since then and the screen worked fine after I replaced it until a few weeks ago when the flickering returned. I'm afraid I am going to have to replace another part in the laptop, either the display cable or another part. If you do your research toshiba laptops are notorious for having screens go out along with other parts even when they are fairly new. This is a huge drawback and if I had done better research beforehand I wouldn't have bought this laptop.A second minor issue is one small turnwheel. The laptop has a small turnwheel on the front you can use to turn volume up and down. This stopped working pretty soon after I got the laptop but this hasn't really impacted me much because I rarely used it anyway.Another issue I am having is that I have had to replace the power cord. I do not move my laptop around much.  It usually sits stationary on my desk so I find it odd the power cord has a short in it when I barley move the laptop off of one spot. So far I have put a lot of money into fixing problems I shouldn't have had to deal with at early times in a laptops life. Instead of fixing the screen again I am just going to hook it up to an external monitor and let it sit stationary on my desk and use it as an at home computer because my screen issues have made it too unreliable to trust in the future. It's not a good computer to travel to school and home with and doesn't seem to react well to you opening and closing it and I think that is what is causing my current screen issues. Instead of putting more money into fixing my toshiba satellite I am just going to buy a new laptop. I have loved this laptop because it has been great with the exception of the repair issues I've had. I've accomplished a lot of work using this machine and it has produced well for me. I am sad to have to give up on this one after trying so hard to get it to work correctly but putting more money into it isn't a possiblity now because I need a laptop for school that isn't going to break down again and I can't be sure this one won't.","Date":"October 16, 2010"}

{"Title":"I'd Skin Them Alive","Author":"Garret Maxwell","ReviewID":"R3Q1CSO330RUSN","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought one of these 'devices' from a Best Buy because another laptop required repair and I needed it to use a computer immediately for travel.  I will say that Toshiba will not receive business from me again, although it takes two to tango.  In this case, the partner is Windows Vista.If you are a generic user that doesn't need to use the laptop for major use, it may not be that bad.  If you are someone like me who will simultaneously have AutoCAD, Excel, and other software open, don't waste your time.  If I could find the decision makers for this laptop and the fine Microsoft persons who gave the green light to Vista, I would skin them alive and then dip them in vinegar to make up for one tenth of the frustration I've had with this computer.When I restart, the computer has always gone into an endless boot where it looks to start with the hard drive, then goes to the DVD play... and back... and forth... and back... and forth... Enough said there.  The laptop is massively overpowered by that dirty diaper full of programming called Vista.  It is a 64 bit version, so realize when you buy it that A LOT OF YOUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN ON 64 bit Vista.  As a result of this purchase (here, we step into the Vista diaper deeper), I had to purchase a new printer, a new version of AutoCAD, a new version of Norton Ghost (which eventually won't run anyways), a new portable scanner... and the list goes on and on. My fine new $800 laptop cost me an extra several thousand dollars to run with modified soft/hardware.  You would think that Toshiba would have been prepared for this kind of problem.  Eventually, I paid a kid to swipe the toilet clean ... I mean the laptop, and replace it with Windows 7.  While this does seem to have solved some problems, the laptop is still underpowered.And Toshiba, thanks for putting a Labelflash drive in it.  Unfortunately, although it does a great job, companies like Toshiba never supported it as well as it should have been supported and Labelflash has turned this into the Beta (of VHS versus Beta fame) when compared to Lightscribe.  Again, I like Labelflash BETTER than Lightscribe, so don't get me wrong about that.  It's just that Labelflash is going bye-bye.  BEWARE - Finding Labelflash DVDs is getting tougher and will get expensive.  It does a great job, but the market has collapsed for them...Maybe I got a lemon?  I can't say for sure, but I can say that Toshiba should be ashamed of putting out such a piece of junk.  Microsoft should be ashamed... well, for the last 10 years of garbage they've put out.  I hope you have better luck than I did if you get this 'device'.Skip this machine and look elsewhere and make sure that you never buy a laptop/computer with a dirty diaper (Vista) installed.-M-PS - Strong letter to follow.","Date":"January 3, 2011"}

It doesn't matter if all application programs are closed and it's been 10 minutes since the last time you used it--there's still a 50% chance it'll just hang.  There are only two ways to get out of this state: 1) hold the power slide button for 10 seconds until the unit turns off, 2) unplug the power cord until the battery is low enough that it turns off. When you power it back on, all is fine (except you'll have to jump through about 6 hoops to restore your background image).Some people might find they run out of storage with only 16 GB, but netbooks are made for cloud computing.

{"Title":"Powerful Workstation","Author":"","ReviewID":"R14VUQXRNOW5Y6","Overall":"good","Content":"Well it is an entry level workstation, but has a professional graphic card not the gaming one. Basically the different are the drivers. I think 15\" widescreen is the good balance between portability and getting some work done on a good size screen. The version I ordered from Lenovo is almost max out with the newer technology. I use N draft at home with 5 GHz frequency. When I go to a coffee shop I have no problem connecting to G and B routers. There is also a wimax which is the next big thing that I don't use or have service. There is a little keyboard light which is cool, but I don't use either; gaming laptop have glowing keyboard.Features:I can't live without the rubber head mouse; I went one generation last time with a Sony Vaio SZ and had to go back. Mainly Lenovo ThinkPad and Dell Latitude laptops still carry this feature. I got to say I like the design of this laptop better than any of the new curvy edge shiny one you can find at electronic stores. Maybe the new Latitudes look very cool and modern too. Displayport (can use hdmi converter) is a great plus while the PC input is still there. I go the turbo memory and I didn't think its made a differences to the boot up speed or software performance. There aren't really any bloat-ware, but some Lenovo system softwares are hogging too much resources. Loading was a fast as my old Sony Vaio SZ, which is much slower than regular computer, which I wanted the turbo memory would fix, but didn't. I use my finger print scanner to save passwords and that is a feature I have grown to like more and more everyday.  I connected my bluetooth keyboard to this once.Built quality is good,The speakers went out after a week, but I sent it in and Lenovo fixed it. Also on the way back the hard drive got damage and they sent me a new hard drive and disc so I install the OS. Overall it is solidly built; layout is very good, only flimsy part is the area over the PC express card. No dead pixels or weird screen things.Performance:I have Photoshop CS2, sometime do Sketchup and Google earth. There is only a very small difference between my laptop and PC with this software; only on bigger files. I hardly ever lose any connections with my D-link N draft router and this laptop. N draft is better than G, I did lose connection when I had an old g router. I stream Netflix and Hulu and it is almost as good as the hardwire connection of my PC. Beside the boot-up is a little slow, I can say this is powerful enough to replace my PC on most tasks. I thought battery these days will last longer, but they really don't, even if the wifi off. I did a movie test on full charge. Sadly this laptop battery didn't last as long as my 2002 Dell Inspirion 8200 for the movie \"Star War\" but not by much. I did turn the wifi off. The Vaio performed about the same as this Thinkpad.ServiceI got to say Lenovo is a lot better than Dell. I never had to use Sony. They got my laptop fixed after I sent it in and tracking and call them was very easy. They want to please me, where Dell thought I was stupid (back in 2002). They had diagnostic they told me to do and immediately knew what the problem was hardware or software. They sent me 3 different installation discs. I guess I didn't make myself clear; I got Vista Professional 64bit. They assume things are 32 bit and Vista home if you don't tell them, which I guess I didn't.I will buy from Lenovo again, and told my brother the same. Quality and service is top notch. Only the speakers went out for some reason.","Date":"June 25, 2009"}

I normally have 6 desktops running at once running: Open Office, LyX, Matlab, Autocad, Chrome, Thunderbird, Zotero, GIMP, and whatever other applications I am using, and it's only recently starting to slow down.Pros:Screen: The best feature of this laptop is the WUXGA screen, it is the most powerful non-apple computer you can buy with a high-resolution 16:10 screen.Waterproof: The computer is basically waterproof, you can spill liquid on the keyboard and it will safely drain through the system.Battery: Battery life is decent, on the order of 3-4 hours with a new battery.Build Quality: Build quality is superb, my laptop is scratched and nicked, but works perfectly.Ultrabay:  I love the thinkpad's ultrabay which allows you to install either a second battery, a cd drive, or a second harddrive.Cons:The main con is that it is the last professional quality thinkpad produced by Lenovo, leading users to head to Apple.Screen brightness: While the screen is the highest resolution you will find in the 16:10 format that is not on an Apple branded laptop, the brightness is to be desired.  It is impossible to use this laptop outside during the day time.No HDMI: It only has display port output, which is OK as you can remap it to HDMI with a $5 adapter, but HDMI is pretty much the standard for digital out.  The Display port also doesn't carry an audio signal, which can be a hassle if you wish to incorporate audio to a presentation.This is a fantastic laptop, and it well exceeded my expectations in every way.  This will be replaced by an Apple, ironically not so I can use Mac OS which will be removed, but so I can have a high resolution screen in a portable 15\" non-widescreen package.","Date":"February 21, 2014"}

This was my first Lenovo computer and it's been such a good experience that i just recently purchased the Lenovo Thinkcentre m92p desktop. I now basically always look to buy Lenovo first. I'm a technology worker and i can assure you that i put the w500 through it's paces, running some of the most demanding software on it such as the Adobe CS suite, Microsoft Visual Studio and more. One primary reason to get the w500 (initially, for me anyway) was the huge 1920x1200 screen resolution. Anyone that does graphics or programming, engineering, or heavy research will benefit greatly from this resolution. This computer is designed for productivity workers, technologists and designers. I see a negative review below and, well, i'm not sure what to say about that person's experience but my experience with Lenovo since 2008 has been awesome. I highly recommend the w500.","Date":"November 10, 2013"}

{"Title":"Do not buy this laptop--or any other Sony laptop","Author":"Abagail Bloodworth \"WiseOldUnicorn\"","ReviewID":"R2G8YZHZLDT8E5","Overall":"bad","Content":"Long story short, this laptop was just fine for a year or so. Not fantastic, but I didn't have any major problems with it. Then the fan started to make a ridiculously loud noise. I go online, find out it's a known issue, called Sony, and had them come fix it for free. No problem. Then the screen starts flickering and showing horizontal lines across the bottom, which gradually gets worse until the screen is basically unusable. I go online, and find out that this is also a known issue, which Sony offers a five-year extended warranty for. After sending it in to Sony, they now refuse to fix it because of what they claim is corrosion due to liquid damage. To my knowledge, no liquid damage had been done to the laptop, so I asked for pictures. The pictures they provided are nothing but dirt and cosmetic damage, which is going to happen with a 3-4 year old laptop. Last time I checked, being dirty did not void your warranty. None of the so-called \"damage\" has anything to do with the issue at hand, which is the fact that Sony produced a laptop that eventually begins to have problems with flickering in the screen. They KNOW they produced a laptop with this issue, yet they refuse to fix it. I have been around the bend several times with Sony customer service, and this whole experience has turned me from a loyal, dedicated Sony fan to someone who will never buy a Sony product again.To summarize: Sony refuses to stand by their products, even for problems that they acknowledge are their fault. I will never buy Sony again, and I would advise anyone reading this to not do so either.","Date":"September 27, 2012"}

{"Title":"Sony Vaio replacement to an 8yr old Dell, Does the job and than some....","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R1UHERU5G1EM8M","Overall":"good","Content":"First off let me say I have had a inspiron 8600 Dell for at least 8yrs and its still alive and kicking and still has all my life's files on it (pics, movies, word docs, music etc..) all within a 60gb harddrive. I did however run into a system problem with the cpu beeping and shutting down the computer a couple times which lead me to research into a new laptop.Now the review. It came down to (after months of research on Core 2 Duo's) the Sony Vaio (which the GF wanted for the fact that it came in white), and my pick again after research the Toshiba Satellite special edition which when compared to the Vaio only differs with the graphics card and bluetooth.I opted for the Sony Vaio (which by the way is cheaper at your local...Fill in the blank major electronic store). I will say its partly due to the GF's white preference, but don't stop reading here and think its all due to that i did want good, no great specs and not want to buy another computer for at least another 5yrs.I read many mixed reviews, and i personally got nervous. I wanted a great computer and always have been an XP person. So vista and only having a Dell made this a big purchase. Well i couldn't be happier. The computer is fast as hell, especially through Ethernet (haven't had the time yet to go get a N wireless router which i am excited about) and Vista is surprisingly fun to use. Searching for files etc. is really the only difference I have encountered. I love the 3D window scroll, and I love the new Windows Media experience with MSN live everything (TV, Music, Movies).People have spoke about bloatware, I don't think there was alot on here to be honest. I am currently using Vaio care, and windows live one (for virus protection). I am also using the preview version of office 2007. Other than that i don't see much on here that's a problem or runs the computer slower. I have disabled the updates after i did all of them so that helps too. The battery isn't bad. On the Vaio power scheme i have it set to balanced and it lasts around 2hrs and 11mins. You can however set the power to max batter which helps it extend to 3hrs, or you can set it to max performance which speeds the computer itself up to max tasks, and windows being opened. I've had at least 10 windows up before and no lag what so ever using balanced power.The webcam is really cool and makes me laugh at the Mac users who paid $12+ for basically the same computer. The software included can do all kinds of fun things with your image as well as let you record videos.The keyboard is slick and very easy to type. Easier than my Dell which i find was alot more clacky than this. The touch pad is generic and the touch media controls well i haven't had much use for them but as i have played around with them although cool and different can be sensitive especially the volume (i use the icon to change the volume). The speakers are good, sometimes programs made for dolby make them sound incredible while other at times sound low (it might have to do with the program and dolby compatibility.)Overall I am very please, everything that i need to do (internet, work with office docs, and pics & music) it does very well. There are some features i have yet to explore but this is a very solid computer and worth the money. Don't waste your time with those watered down netbooks or low priced asus computers with no specs to them. Get a laptop that has what you need in it and more, it will save you the trouble later on.I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because of the lower end graphics card (which hasn't been a problem just wish for future things it had the better card) and lack of HDMI (has vga instead). Other than that its a solid notebook that makes a great replacement to my old Dell.","Date":"April 4, 2009"}

This software, the Open MG Secure Module, is not compatible with Windows 7 so you have to find the installation file and remove it which is difficult. Contact Sony Support if this happens to you.So-So:- Webcam and accompanying software is ok, nothing amazing but gets the job done for Skype and Oovoo- Wifi switch is in a spot that you can hit accidentally so be careful about that- I kind of wish there was a way to lock the top closed like some of the older laptops did, but that's more of a personal preference thing...Overall the Sony Vaio CS series is a good laptop for any student. It was an upgrade from my old laptop and fulfills its job nicely.","Date":"July 26, 2010"}

{"Title":"Do not buy this laptop--or any other Sony laptop","Author":"Abagail Bloodworth \"WiseOldUnicorn\"","ReviewID":"R2G8YZHZLDT8E5","Overall":"bad","Content":"Long story short, this laptop was just fine for a year or so. Not fantastic, but I didn't have any major problems with it. Then the fan started to make a ridiculously loud noise. I go online, find out it's a known issue, called Sony, and had them come fix it for free. No problem. Then the screen starts flickering and showing horizontal lines across the bottom, which gradually gets worse until the screen is basically unusable. I go online, and find out that this is also a known issue, which Sony offers a five-year extended warranty for. After sending it in to Sony, they now refuse to fix it because of what they claim is corrosion due to liquid damage. To my knowledge, no liquid damage had been done to the laptop, so I asked for pictures. The pictures they provided are nothing but dirt and cosmetic damage, which is going to happen with a 3-4 year old laptop. Last time I checked, being dirty did not void your warranty. None of the so-called \"damage\" has anything to do with the issue at hand, which is the fact that Sony produced a laptop that eventually begins to have problems with flickering in the screen. They KNOW they produced a laptop with this issue, yet they refuse to fix it. I have been around the bend several times with Sony customer service, and this whole experience has turned me from a loyal, dedicated Sony fan to someone who will never buy a Sony product again.To summarize: Sony refuses to stand by their products, even for problems that they acknowledge are their fault. I will never buy Sony again, and I would advise anyone reading this to not do so either.","Date":"September 27, 2012"}

Sony Backup thing keeps popping up when computer is turned on and no way to make it go away, even after clicking \"don't show again\".Media control button stopped working.Function buttons that adjusts the brightness, sound, screen position stopped working.Screen started flickering.I've only had this computer for 3 months. Love the pinkness and hate everything else.Spent hours talking to tech support on Dec 23 online and on the phone.  Was told to take computer into local service desk.  Found one at Beverly Center and spent Christmas Eve there. Technician told me I have to have the receipt with me (would be nice for them to tell me when I called to make the appointment). And that they have to ship in the computer and it would take at least 2 weeks for me to get it back because the Service Desk can't do anything at the store except help customers ship in the computer.Spent another 45 min on the phone with Service Center on the phone to schedule someone to come out instead.Was told technician would come out and fix it in 3 business days.  3 business days have come and gone... no calls.. so called in today to find out what's up.  Been on the phone for 2 hours now just to try to get the time the technician would come out.Asked them what part was shipped out to fix these problems and was told \"the fan\".  AMAZING FAN!!! A simple fan can fix all these issues!!!!Turns out that Sony outsource the service to a company called Nexicore and after 2 hours, Sony just told me here's the number to Nexicore... try calling them. Sweet deal. Back to Dell from now on.","Date":"December 30, 2009"}

{"Title":"Not perfect, but simple and elegant.","Author":"C. Goshorn","ReviewID":"R1IH68B8FR9E5R","Overall":"good","Content":"For the price this laptop offers, it's a pretty good deal. Be Sure that when you do get it you know what it's for.The video card is by far the systems downfall, it's (as an early reviewer said) an intel 4 family video card so those looking to any high end or recent gaming might be looking elsewhere, a gaming laptop with this display size at this price doesn't exist. That being said, it still plays games like WoW on lower (not lowest, but lower) settings and it can be enjoyed comfortably. Any game circa 2004 will run fine, but you shouldn't be expecting much from an on-board video card (also I stress that laptop video card upgrades typically are impossible)The Machine does have a Blu Ray drive and I'm sure Sony is more than interested in you watching their new format on it, and to be honest despite the max resolution of 1280x800 the Blu Rays really shine, they look gorgeous and clean ... the problem is there is no DVI ouput just VGA which means you will be watching them on the laptop and nothing else if you want to enjoy your Blu Ray. I have a PS3 though, for home use. Still, it's nice when you go on a trip and need to take your favorite high def movie along. Despite the weaker card the computer still makes Blu Ray look good, an earlier review speculated it wouldn't be possible but it is. It looks fine.The design of the computer is really nice, the body of the computer is textured almost like cloth giving it a comfortable feel. I have one friend who bizarrely enough will rub my computer when he sees it I have to admit it is rather nice feeling. Sony has always had a nice design aesthetic and it shows here, with a nice looking, well laid out keyboard, and solid feeling construction. The shape and feel of the laptop really has that sleek minimalist feel that many companies today seem to be going for. Which is simply because it makes the machine look good, I dunno what else to say there.The computer isn't without its flaws, however. For starters Sony includes an incredibly large amount of software with the computer. Some programs are useful, but largely they waste your space with some very insulting programs, like a wireless setup wizard that takes you to the default windows one, no one needs to waste space on such asinine programs. Vaio update, alternately, seems useless until you discover their drivers are edited for the laptop so you have to go through them. Another bizarre decision on Sony's part.In conclusion if you're a person who wants a computer that isn't embarassingly ugly with a sleek classy minimalist design, and wants good performance in a mid-priced laptop, this very well could be for you. If you're looking to do heavy high-end gaming or need your first Blu Ray player there are better ways to spend your money for both of those.Hope this helps and answers any questions anyone has.","Date":"September 6, 2009"}

{"Title":"Yes..... But","Author":"Samadhi1138 \"DCC\"","ReviewID":"R1Q658F4715044","Overall":"good","Content":"I couldn't agree more with the other reviews regarding the deceptiveness of some outfits - in this case Tiger - in selling refurbished items as new.  I felt that it was important, however, to review the product and not the vendor.  I've used the D610 professionally with great success for several years.  I was so pleased with its performance that I bought one for my personal use as well as two more for my in-laws.  I bought all three as refurbs but I knew what I was getting and the price was unbeatable at approximately $250.00 each.  If you're a wannabe geek such as I am, you can easily find all of the service literature necessary to service the D610 yourself.  I've never had to service any of the three that I bought, but I did expand the memory in all of them.  I was pleased with how easy the upgrade was, how well engineered the product is, and how clear the service literature is as well.  I bought a hard drive caddy and an additional 80GB HD to fit in the CD port, so now I have 2 bootable HDs and a ton of storage.  If forced to search for a negative, the only thing I can come up with is the click action of the pointing device.  The feel is a bit stiff and the sound is somewhat irritating.  That said, if the pointing device ever became bothersome enough a USB mouse could be purchased for a couple of bucks.  I was looking for another D610 to buy for my wife when I stumbled upon these reviews so I felt compelled to put in my two cents worth.  Good luck with whatever product you choose!","Date":"July 26, 2009"}

Today Microsoft told me that the license is not valid. It has a valid certificate of authenticity on the back but does not have a second \"refurbished\" CoA. When I look at the internal System Properties/General tab it says \"XP Corporate\" which means it was covered under a mass/site license which can not be transferred or sold. I will probably have to buy a fresh copy of XP ($100) and re-install.Before I made the order I checked to see that the advertisement specified \"Genuine Windows XP\".

He even agreed to add an extra GIG of space. It took him 3+ weeks to send the replacement. On 2/7 he sent the replacement and told me to let him know when I receive it. As soon as the computer came, I immediately tried to download antivirus software and I had the same issue. I emailed the seller regarding the issue and did not get a response for several days.

{"Title":"Very good price/performer from HP","Author":"J. Ferrer","ReviewID":"R1FLNU95GH7ECX","Overall":"good","Content":"The G70-250US laptop is a very capable laptop but with a 17\" screen it is not a lightweight.  After 3 days of use these are my initial comments. The \"HP Imprint\" silver finish on the keyboard is very smooth which has a glassy feel which I didn't' like initially, but it may grow on me.  The 4 directional keys, which are grouped below the right shift key, are half height keys which seem a little too small. The volume control is a two key operation which uses the left function key and a volume key, and that is a slight annoyance as compared to my other HP laptop (NC6220) which takes only 1 key press.  The speakers and the LCD display perform very well when viewing HD movie trailers and various DVD's. There is nearly 25GB of preloaded software, and I removed about 50% of which I don't care to use or have acquired previously.  Microsoft Vista is a decent OS, however I found a case where it was not compatible with my Netgear WGT624V3 wireless router (search the web for details on making a registry change in Vista).  I'll describe my laptop use to be 70% business, 30%  casual audio/Photoshop editing and web shopping mostly at home.  I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop knowing it's not a stellar performer but capable one for doing ordinary office work and recreational stuff which doesn't require the Intel \"Genius\" processor. It's a pretty good price performer from HP (and my 3rd HP laptop).","Date":"January 25, 2009"}

It runs fast, quiet & smooth & the screen has such a brilliant picture! For school i use a lot of (allegedly) very high end computers for Computer Aided Design & Illustration classes, & honestly the picture on this notebook is a thousand times clearer than those more expensive machines.

{"Title":"Great basic computer for the money","Author":"Thousand Oaks PC Club \"BK\"","ReviewID":"R1IP6HY5NK83NG","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this laptop after comparing price/performance for low cost laptops. I ruled out AMD CPUs as comparable Intel mobile processors are faster. I have been using this HP for 10 days and have found it to be an excellent computer after a number of changes as follows:1. Uninstalled all the trial software and other programs I will not use.2. Ran MSConfig, Startup, and removed every program from Startup except the four items for the Intel Graphics processor.3. Went to Administrative Services and comparing it with the recommendations on [...] changed a lot of services from Automatic (startup) to either Manual or Disable. This removed a lot more programs that ran at startup.4. Added a number of new programs that I use.5. Upgraded the memory from 3GB to 4GB.Even before I performed step 5. above, this computer was now very fast  It uses an Intel T4200 mobile dual processor which is only about 8% slower than the Intel T6400 processor featured in most of the higher priced mainstream laptops. If you wish to upgrade memory, there is one step that is not included in any instructions I have seen. After changing a memory module, you must disconnect the hard drive for 5 seconds or more or your computer will not start. I found this out after an hour on the phone with HP tech support. I highly recommend HP tech support as I found them to be knowledgeable even if they are in India. Upgrading the memory will not void your warranty. One thing to note - the HP warranty is 90 days with HP paying for shipping both ways, labor and materials. After that for the balance of one year you pay shipping and labor and HP pays for parts.Everything works well, from easy wireless connection to the modem, etc. I like everything about this laptop and recommend it if you can buy it a low price. HP has a rebate on this computer until June 27th, and also offers a full or partial rebate on certain HP printers when you buy this computer.","Date":"May 14, 2009"}

Approximately 8 months into it, the hinge system started falling apart on the left hand side.  I entered into a chat session with customer service.  They sent a box to pack the computer in to send in for repairs under the warranty.  I received a call from a case manager who accused me of dropping the laptop and said that \"even if what I said were the truth\" and it wasn't dropped, it wouldn't be covered anyway because it would be considered normal wear and tear.  He wanted over $400 to repair the computer.  I told him to just send it back to me.  Upon receiving it, my lcd screen is now broken.  Believe it or not, they will not accept any responsibility for the damage to my computer.  2 out of 3 of the customer service reps I spoke with in the repair division were incredibly rude.  I am not an engineer but even I know that this is a design flaw.  The lcd screen is just too heavy for the hinge system to survive over a very long period of time with even minimal use.  I couldn't be any more disappointed in a company.  They will not take responsbility for their own faulty product.  In my case, to make an even bad situation worse, they caused further damage and won't even make any effort to correct the problem.  I will never, ever buy another product from HP.","Date":"March 5, 2010"}

Vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.  When I sent it back to HP for my warranty they said the damage was my fault and would cost me $435.00 dollars to fix.  By looking at other web posts I have found out that this is the standard response to anything you want fixed by your warranty.  If you buy an HP just remember your warranty is worthless.  If you notice when you open this laptop the LCD screen is very flimsy.  This seems to be a terrible engineering design.  Maybe this is what led to the LCD screen going bad.  It appears to me that the LCD could easily be damaged under normal use which happened evidently to me.  The reason HP computers cost less than other brands is because they evidently don't have to support there warrranty or pay much for there engineering.","Date":"July 7, 2009"}

So far the only problem I had was with the battery. When plugged in one day the power light kept blinking and it said my battery was not charging. I called HP and was sent a new battery free of charge. Then when I received the new battery it did it again, HP told me to take the battery out and hold the power button for 45 seconds. This seemed to work until a few days later it started acting up again. I have noticed that it only does this if the laptop gets too hot, so this is probably my fault bc Im always sitting in bed with it and my comforter blocks the fan. After unblocking the fan it works and charges just fine...so maybe this is some kind of safety measure? Anyways, one feature that I would like for this laptop to have is a backlit keyboard and a better placement of the powersource cord (it sticks out on the side and gets caught on stuff). Other than that this computer has yet to do me wrong. When you get it just make sure to clean out the bloatware bc this baby is loaded with it! If you have pets that like to jump in your lap while on the computer be wary bc my five month old pug jumped on my lap and when she slid off she popped off the right arrow key and broke the plastic retainer (its been hell finding a replacement). The finish of this laptop is beautiful but it is easily dirtied by fingerprints and dust, as well as the screen. I have yet to burn dvds or cds on here but Im sure it wont be a problem. I dont see why everyone hates Vista b/c I have used every new version since Windows 95 and I adapted to this like a fish in water...just be careful not to accidentally delete the trashcan bc once you do and you get it back it somehow loses its \"brain\" and the icon is forever empty or full lol.

The monitor size is generous (17 inches), which is important to me because I write lots of technical documents. Its weight is somewhat large (nearly 10 lbs), so if you are looking for ultra portable notebooks, this is probably not what you are looking for.With the ample memory (3 GB), Vista runs smoothly and programs load up quickly. Program installs proceed without hiccups. Even when the computer is running lots of programs, I do not notice any thrashing to the hard disk and the machine purrs on.Other comments: Laptop does not get heated up. The keyboard size is ample, allowing the hands to rest on the laptop while typing.

The VISTA Premium that was original to the HDD was great - I got mine for $674.95 free shipping from Amazon Direct. Excellent price for a spanking new machine, especially 3 years ago as price inflation goes etc. (I see its $949.00 from some other sellers than Amazon Directly now, hmmm...perhaps that itself shows what a reliable, and nice to use machine it is, as it costs like $300.00 more now than it did for me when it was a new product on the market, or maybe mine was made better at the time...) The ONLY problem I've had is I have gone through 2 Hard Drives, but I blame that on my use of the machine - I download stuff 24/7 and run ripping & video encoding programs at the same time, again 24/7 365 days a...well, a lot. And I KNOW this has been the downfall of my previous HDD's as over time the HDD's would begin running hotter and hotter (while the performance overall of the entire pc stayed A+, I would be runnin' virus scans, sufring the net,God only knows what else while backing up a DVD and downloading a torrent file and this pc peformed like a champ the whole time!) then the 1st HDD just stopped in the middle of my \"work\" and the next one I bought-the pc gave my the code for when your HDD is defective or damaged, again after much abuse by be.

Within 3 months, the fan started squealing intermittently.  By 6 months, it squeals non stop so she pretty much stopped using the laptop.  It was unbearable to listen to.  Being lazy, I forgot about it until she was wanting to use the laptop again months later (we have a family desktop and I was probably using it).  By then our warranty was out and I checked into a new fan.  $50 for a fan!  Being that I built my own desktop, I figured I could change it myself.  Everything must come apart before the fan goes in.  I took it apart with much difficulty, and just think that I'd be better off buying her a new laptop.  As complicated as it is, I don't want to waste the $50 should I have destroyed the laptop while trying to get to the fan.  I write this review now, because I'm beginning to search for a replacement laptop.  I think it will be a long long time until I buy another HP product.

Not that big of a deal, but I cannot believe it is not listed as such.Second, the laptop comes preloaded with a ton of junk and is heavily integrated with Windows Live stuff. Messenger, Live toolbar, etc. It comes with a trial of Norton Internet Security and a trial of Office 2007. My advice: Get Norton off the computer ASAP and install another anti-virus product.Third, no operating system CD's come with the package. There is a \"Recovery\" partition that contains about 12 GB of stuff (not 100% sure what exactly is on there). I do know that when setting up the computer it tells you you should create recovery CD's. I went through the setup to create the discs and here's the kicker - they want 21 CD's or 3 DVD's to create the recovery discs. Talk about stupid.As of now, I have wiped the OS partition and loaded Windows 7 Beta. The driver recognition is fantastic on Windows 7 - both my wired and wireless ethernet drivers were install out-of-the-box.The look and feel of this model is gorgeous. The 17\" HD screen is amazing and the whole laptop has this slick look and feel to it. The bronze color scheme really stands out.All in all, you cannot beat the price of this laptop. For what it comes with, a comparable model from another vendor would cost $600-700 more than what I bought mine for ($898 + tax).Last, this is just my opinion and should be taken as such. Please do yourself a favor and do not install XP on this. This laptop is too great to go back to XP. AERO does look nice and this laptop should be able to run anything you throw at it. Even a clean install of Vista should not give you any problems. While XP works great for most people, do not fight change and try to give Vista/7 a fair chance. Hell, even try the newest Ubuntu (I think 8.10) because that should look great on this too.","Date":"February 1, 2009"}

The whole laptop is bronze, including the keyboard, and the keyboard letters & numbers appear to be gray. I tried moving my reading lamp as close as possible to the laptop & I still can't make out the letters & numbers properly. I have to keep moving my head around from different angles just to see. I can't believe HP would release a product with this obvious problem...If only the letters & numbers were white against the bronze this notebook would have gotten 5 stars!Anyone out there with this issue, and if so is there any solution besides returning it?Everything else seems to be very good.EDIT!!! February 28th, 2009I returned this & purchased the DV7-1150US, very similar features in silver-gray. The keyboard is legible, black letters & numbers on silver-gray. Very nice.","Date":"January 26, 2009"}

You are getting an HD monitor, built in webcam and microphone, silent keyboard which is perfectly sized for an adult, a beautiful interface, a lovely touchpad to turn up your volume, mute, play, fast forward and rewind... a 64 bit system with 4 GB of RAM capable of holding 8 GB of RAM... amazing.  the mouse touchpad has a scroll function on its side.  this computer has state of the art audio, (the speakers of this brand are very costly), a dedicated video graphics card, and a very powerful processor.  coupled with its sleek design you cannot go wrong.  its versatile, and it is very easy to set up networking.  I have it set up in my home network. bought it 2 days ago and its fully functional.  all laptops are more delicate than desktops and not a replacement.  i got a service plan through BB in the case of hardware damage such as the monitor.  this is always wise.  anyway, take care of it and you have a great machine with great graphics capability and i already have an HP desktop and i'd say its comparable if not better.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}
{"Title":"Great all Round Laptop / Media System","Author":"N. Jones \"elevenss\"","ReviewID":"RVCZIM7UP151U","Overall":"good","Content":"I have several HP laptops with 17\" screens (dv9910us as well as this dv7-1270us). The screen size is great, but I could see that trying to carry these in a backpack for school use could be a load. The displays are fantastic and the NVidia graphics card is super. The speed for boot-up, network connectivity and multi-tasking of applications is also fabulous.This has fantastic sound for music with the Altec Lansing dual speakers on top and subwoofer on the bottom. Of course it can be hooked to a media center via the built-in HDMI or USB ports for impressive sound and Blue-ray DVD play.Battery life is about 3 - 4 hours with the power management default settings out of the box.All round this is a great package, with the few cons noted below.Cons:1. Bluetooth headsets / headphones don't work for listening to music. I've written to HP and visited forums, and it seems that there is some issue with MS Vista that Microsoft hasn't fixed. This is a bit disappointing, however, if you are planning to run with XP (which I'm not sure will work with this 64 bit microprocessor) it may be ok. I, as are many, awaiting a fix for this issue. Many have reported issues with Bluetooth Stack Service not working. I found that there is a Microsoft patch (something to do with ActiveX killbits), that causes this problem. After the Bluetooth stopped working correctly, and rebuilding my system I found that by not installing this \"fix\" the Bluetooth works for everything (phone, mp3 player, etc.), but not with the headphones - for listening to music. Headphones do work for skype and with the phone.2. The built-in Intel 5100 AGN WiFi Network adapter always indicates that its running at 54.0Mbps, even though I have a Netgear 854T Wireless-N router that can run at 300.0Mbps. If I connect a Netgear WPN121T USB adapter the HP Networking status indicates 300.0Mbps for that adapter. However, both adapters seem equally as fast for loading of webpages and downloads, so I'm not sure if the build-in Intel 5100 adapter is really running at 300.0Mbps even though it indicates on 54.0Mbps. I've been working with HP on this issue and they have not been able to fix yet.3. The touch pad (as on all of these HPs) can act bizarrely, in that the mouse will jump to some other place when you touch the pad. It doesn't happen all of the time, but can be rather annoying. I'm not sure if it has to do with the way the notebook is leveled, but I do notice that if the keyboard is not on a stable table top or work space, the mouse jumping seems to happen more frequently. The synaptic touch pad driver sw provides some settings which seem to help.4. Finally, the built-in cooling fan is noticably louder in the dv7-1270us than in the dv9910us models I have. Fortunately, in the BIOS it can be set to turn-on/off as needed, and not run continuously, so it's not too bad, but it pitch is at a frequency that causes my ears to ring if it runs very long.","Date":"April 7, 2009"}
{"Title":"Feature packed and priced well below the competition.","Author":"Deee Lovely \"deeeelovely\"","ReviewID":"R2ZPQKX1Y28B07","Overall":"good","Content":"I will start this review by saying that my old laptop was beyond slow and well past its prime, so just about anything would have been a huge improvement.  I did a fair amount of research and this laptop was by far the most feature-packed for the price.  The same specs with a different brand name would have cost me $700-$900 more, easily.The laptop is loaded with entertainment features like webcam, bluray, HDMI port, 4 USB ports, TWO headphone jacks and lightscribe!  I will admit, the lightscribe was a huge plus.  If you don't know, it's a way to laser etch artwork/words onto burned CDs/DVDs instead of using sticker labels or writing on them with permanent markers.  I have no complaints with any of this stuff because these are all features I've not had until now and I'm just excited to have them at all.  The laptop is blazingly fast compared to my old one (but that's not saying much).  It has a neat touch bar above the keyboard that lets you quickly: mute/unmute, control volume, play, pause, forward, rewind, stop, and even turn off the wifi.  It's a huge laptop, you may have a hard time finding a bag it will fit in (seriously), but it's not an issue for me.  I love having such a large screen and I don't move the laptop around much (I would not have purchased a laptop this large for heavy travel).  I also love that it has a full sized keyboard (YAY!) and a separate number keypad off to the right for super speedy number crunching!  It has a cute little remote control so you can hook the laptop up to your TV and use it as a sometimes bluray/DVD player, it even stores in the side of the laptop when not in use.  I also like that this machine doesn't seem to get hot at all...my old laptop you could fry eggs on that thing for how hot it ran!The not so great stuff:It comes with Vista and I don't like it, but it's not the laptop's fault, they all come with Vista now, don't they.It has a lot of bloatware (a lot of preinstalled software that you probably don't need and just having it there takes up space and hogs memory/resources) and no easy way to remove it without doing a wipe/reinstall...and it does not come with Vista CDs to do that which complicates things a bit.I read a lot of reviews talking about the keys being almost unreadable, for everything else that came with this machine for this price...I was willing to paint them on myself if it was really that bad!  I'm not sure if HP fixed the problem or if I'm not using the laptop in the same conditions as those with the complaints, but I can see/read them fine (I use the laptop indoors with ambient/indirect sun lighting for the most part).  The keys and laptop are a metallic bronze color, so it has a bit of a mirror like finish that I could certainly do without...but it is not nearly as obnoxious/annoying/blinding as the laptops with that chrome/silver mirror finish. That's all with the aesthetics; not the important stuff (not to me anyway).For the price and being chock full of features, I can't justify taking off a star for any of the very minor flaws.  I've had this for almost a month now and I love it. I will update this review once I've had it longer should anything change or need mentioning.","Date":"July 14, 2009"}
{"Title":"Good laptop, but with one fatal flaw","Author":"John Brook Monroe \"Tech guy and home cook\"","ReviewID":"R13MW9Z0KJZYUR","Overall":"good","Content":"The flaw is not, as some people have suggested, in the keyboard.  It's in the chrome strip on which the power button rests, along with a volume control, and the single, only, solitary, absolutely-no-other-way-to-do-this, wireless switch.  The wireless switch isn't a positive contact mechanical switch like the power button--it's a capacitance \"touch\" location which ceases to function if the chrome strip happens to short against something.  This not only turns off the wireless and makes turning it back on virtually impossible, it also causes the audio volume slide area to short, which makes the audio volume dialog strobe on and off repeatedly, accompanied by a cascade of annoying clicks.We are returning the laptop to HP for warranty repairs on the hardware, and hoping that the unit comes back completely fixed.I think that making the wireless functional only through a single, highly-suspect switch is a bad design.  I've expressed this view to HP already.Beyond that issue (and we have the chrome, not the bronze finish), I think the laptop excels in all other ways.  I'll be happy to see it back and functioning in about...oh, maybe 10 days from now.","Date":"April 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"HP Pavilion dv1260us w/ 17\" Screen","Author":"Dr. Miles","ReviewID":"R2MOOYRQYAW02L","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had my HP Pavilion dv1260us for 7 months now.  At first, I was totally jazzed by the unit - a great 17\" screen, which I love, along with many other great features.  It was fast and worked great.  But then, after 5 or 6 months of fairly heavy use, I began having problems.Before I get into those, let me say that I took very good care of the laptop - using it only at home - not taking it anywhere or abusing it in any way.  (Due to severe space constraints, I choose to use a laptop rather than a desktop computer.)  Since I use an added wireless keyboard, I do not have an issue with the laptop's keyboard as expressed in other comments.Without going into long, tedious details, the main problems consisted of the DVD player failing.  I contacted HP tech support, which I personally think is very good - I got e-mail replies within a couple of hours and they continued to try to work with me.  Bottom line, I never did get the DVD player to work, which in many ways makes the computer useless as you cannot play your movies or music on disk and you cannot download the software programs that come with new hardware items such as printers, etc.The other major thing that started to happen was the computer just began shutting down for no apparent reason.  I contacted HP tech support and tried many interventions without fixing the problem.  The most recent thing (disaster!) which happened was all of a sudden I got a blue screen with the dreaded message: \"Fatal System Failure.\"  I have no formal training with computers; however, I have used them for years and have sort of learned along the way.  So, I tried everything that I could think of and finally got the laptop to boot up.  Everything looked okay, except as I checked things out further, I discovered that I had lost all of my files!  I was so grateful that just 3 weeks before I had subscribed to a back-up service which daily scans and stores the contents of your computer, so I was able to successfully restore everything.  (By the way, I highly recommend getting a reputable back-up service.  It can prevent disaster!)So, now everything is restored (at least for the moment) and I haven't had a shut-down in a while, but the DVD unit still does not work.  Plus, I have \"lost faith\" in the computer.  With the kind of work that I do, which includes being a webmaster, I MUST have a reliable machine that I can trust.Rather than return the computer and go thru whatever delays that may entail, I have decided to try a different brand.  I had poor luck with my last HP Pavilion, so I am ready for a brand change.  The other computer also had problems with the DVD unit.  In my opinion, HP does not produce the high-quality computers that they used to a while back.My very first computer many years ago was an Acer, which I had good luck with, so I have decided to go back and give that brand a re-try.  I will return this HP unit for whatever repair or replacement HP may give, but I will not use it as my primary computer.I hope this review has been useful.  I think many times a review is done before the \"honeymoon\" for a given product is over and in my opinion many of those early reviews are skewed towards the positive.  Since I have had this computer for over 6 months, I do think this review might be a bit more accurate than those done after just a few weeks or less of product use.  Wishing you the best of luck with your computer search!","Date":"September 15, 2009"}

This computer has all the USB's on the Left and Right sides, plugging any USB cable will be in your way especially if you need a clear area for a mouse. you can't place any documents or books on either side because it will damage or bend the USB jack etc. Another thing that they don't mention except if you dig deep into HP's site, you can not use Windows XP as a second OS although they make it sound that dual boot is a piece of cake.

HP's warranty service is completely worthless, people, so you better hope this thing has no issues.  Mine decided to just quit one day - no warning, it just shut itself off and would never come up again.  Tried tech support, who walked me thru checking memory & the drive (not the problem).  Shipped it back, they \"fixed\" it, and when I got it back 1/2 the memory was missing and the unit was still not fixed (same problems).  So I got a case manager and an \"escalated 2nd service\".  Now I'm told that they've taken enough time to run out the warranty, and they want $300+ to fix what they failed to fix on the first repair.Next time, I'll buy something built by a reputable company.  HP once fell in that category, but no longer.","Date":"January 26, 2010"}
{"Title":"This WILL fail and HP customer support will not help you.","Author":"J. Simpson","ReviewID":"R371B45UZZ6X","Overall":"bad","Content":"HP laptops are ticking time bombs. My Pavilion dv7 1260us got a power drain 14 months after getting it. Eventually the battery stops charging and even while plugged in it doesn't power on. After replacing the AC adapter at the suggestion of their website, and replacing the battery at the recommendation of telephone support they wanted $400 to replace the motherboard.As I've learned the hard way like many others, HP has become a terrible company that makes bad products and has even worse customer support. I've had the Pavailion dv7 for about a year with no problems, then as soon as the warranty expires so does the device. Contacting customer support is about as useful as shooting yourself in the face. They are really sales people that are more interested in selling you more products that will not fix your device, and all done in bad english. Their once great customer support has been outsourced to India. You'll end up talking to somebody that knows half as much about computers as you, and reads the same trouble shooting tips they have on thier website.I will never again buy an HP product.","Date":"June 6, 2010"}

The screen is very nice quite large, however the screen is glossy so if you are in an office or anywhere near sunlight forget seeing the screen without glare.  Glare off of the keyboard makes the keys unreadable in office lighting.  After about 3 months of use this machine started getting so hot it would shut off on it's own.  Making me lose all my work and just poof, gone, it would restart and do it again in about 2 hours.  HP support 6 months later and 25 calls later they have yet to bother to even try to fix this machine with this known issue!!!!!!!!  I call , they say I am out of warranty,  i say bull,  I give them all the info, they say oh you are under warranty please hold, then they so ok we will send a box.  Well no box ever comes, so I call again every week, and every week same old story again and again they make me flip over the machine and give the serial number and tell me it is out of warranty.  I am quite sure they will continue with this until it actually is out of warranty.  And if they do bother to try to fix it,  I am not confident it will come back to me working any better.

{"Title":"HP Pavilion DV7 Is Great for Powerful On The GO Computing","Author":"The Anomaly \"Anomaly\"","ReviewID":"R156ZFWMHUBPA7","Overall":"good","Content":"This laptop is a huge bargain for its price. It provides for more computing power and functionality than any laptop in its class/price-range.The most appealing feature of this laptop is its superior casing and finish. Its very glossy and stands out with a bright light of the HP logo on the top lid (back of the monitor). The illuminating MediaSmart touch-sensitive functions above the keyboard also make it a uniquely designed laptop. Its color has an eloquent yet stylish appeal.This laptop is not all cosmetic, however. It comes with enough processing power and memory to take on heavy duty multimedia for your audio and video needs. The sound quality is amazing with the Altec Lansing speakers providing SRS premium sound. It even has a great built in HP web cam with HP software to make taking tasteful pictures and recording professional video a cinch for even an amateur. This model does not have the built in TV Tuner or thumb print security features advertised on similar HP models. It does come with a preloaded version of Vista with SP1 and has Microsoft Office Home and Student trial version packaged for an out-of-the-box experience.The laptop display is crystal clear with stunning graphic quality on a 17\" monitor. Plenty of room with a full functioning keyboard and number pad that will make you feel as though you are using a desktop keyboard. I tried this laptop out for an entire day when I received it and it has proven well worth its price.I was very satisfied with the Next Day shipping as the laptop arrived on time and had no noticeable defects. There was some adhesive tape stuck to the edge of the laptop, but was easily removed and with no physical damage to the device.Incredibly this computer packs a lot of punch and is still light weight. It does not overheat even on your lap with a 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo. Beautiful LED lights flood the keyboard against the glossy chrome finish making it a perfect display for use in a dark or dim lit room.The WiFi card is wonderful with extended range. I was able to pick up my router from the end of my drive way and even at the end of the street. The remote is included for media functionality. You can listen to your music or watch videos without having to touch the keyboard or mouse. The wireless remote fits neatly inside the dedicated slot above the SD-MS/Pro card reader. You've got 4 USB ports (2 on each side) and an place to plug in your HDMI cable to your HD TV. This is wonderful for me to give live presentations on an HD TV at work at conferences.This is definitely a lot of bang for you buck. I had a Compaq Pressario laptop before this, which I bought on a limited budget at the time. I didn't think the battery would die on me so soon. This HP was definitely worth the extra cash.I was originally thinking of buying a Dell before I bought the HP DV7, but considering the huge difference in price and much faster delivery this was a sweet deal. The Dell would have taken 4 days longer to ship with a higher shipping cost (on expedited shipping) and with the same specifications (at a $500 price tag difference). I bought this at around 11:40 PM on Tuesday from amazon and had it on my doorstep by 2:00 PM on Thursday.Two thumbs up!","Date":"May 14, 2009"}
{"Title":"Mixed Feelings Over This HP Pavilion Laptop","Author":"Marissa","ReviewID":"R3RQGSMKE9QXHO","Overall":"good","Content":"I have the 1245dx version of this laptop.  The 17-inch screen is marvelous and the laptop's design and the chrome/bronze finish is sharp and makes it look so much more expensive than it actually is.  It is not as portable as other laptops but is an acceptable trade-off to have a big screen.  The keys are very comfortable and have a nice soft touch, the space bar is short and works well ergonomically, and the keyboard is laid out with number keys off to the right, which is useful.  Both for work and for play [media applications], you feel like you have a mini flat screen TV on your desk.My review of this laptop is mixed however.  This HP Pavilion refreshes slower than the Compaq Presarios my kids have.  Also, when changing the appearance of the menu and other texts, there are some fonts that end up with less fidelity - parts of letters are faded!  The worse is the white color of the letters/symbols on the keyboard.  They are very hard to see against a bronze background.  If you look at the keys from the right side at an angle, the letters and symbols are very visible.  But who would crank their necks this far to type?  When looking directly over the keys, more than half of the letters and symbols are nearly invisible!  So much for fashion versus function.Other than these complaints, I would still recommend this laptop.  Will I buy another one?  Yes, but only if they do something about the colors on the keyboard.","Date":"April 21, 2009"}

Impossible to see even in a good light!  What were they thinking?  I returned mine and received a full refund (Yay Amazon).A friend subsequently purchased one at Best Buy with white letters on the keys but she still has trouble seeing those in certain lights.  I think it is the flatness of the keys as well as the color and gloss that makes it difficult.  Also, the PC lays fairly flat if you don't buy the longer life battery so that may contribute.  Note that the model offered via Amazon is NOT the same as you see in Best Buy, etc. That one is a DV7-1245.

It's whisper quiet, quick and efficient, and great for BluRay playback. I like the infrared remote, the MediaSmart interface, the lights that double as \"buttons\" (including the volume control), and I'm finding Windows Vista more tolerable than expected. I am a huge AMD and ATI fan, so I know I'm getting a quality product.The outputs are varied and numerous, and include HDMI and eSATA.

A lot of bloatware, but that's to be expected no matter what laptop you buy from these big companies.Other than the color, there's nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed. And let's face it, you don't use your laptop for the color anyways. Incidentally, I don't mind much the silver letters on the kays.

It's whisper quiet, quick and efficient, and great for BluRay playback. I like the infrared remote, the MediaSmart interface, the lights that double as \"buttons\" (including the volume control), and I'm finding Windows Vista more tolerable than expected. I am a huge AMD and ATI fan, so I know I'm getting a quality product.The outputs are varied and numerous, and include HDMI and eSATA. But I think I'm most excited about the long term possibilities of adding a second internal hard drive to this puppy.All right.... cons....No bluetooth... but that doesn't bother me too much (get a usb bluetooth port or there's a place for an internal upgrade if you're into that sort of thing). And I hate this weird shiny bronze color they chose (with a shiny chrome touchpad). A lot of bloatware, but that's to be expected no matter what laptop you buy from these big companies.Other than the color, there's nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed. And let's face it, you don't use your laptop for the color anyways. Incidentally, I don't mind much the silver letters on the kays.

I contacted HP to fix it and before I agreed to send it in, I was told that \"it would be $399 to send it in, look at it and fix it, however if the cost of the repair is less than this amount, I would be refunded the difference.  They charged me $422.80 to CLEAN THE FAN!  They also (allegedly) replaced the sound card ($50) and Ethernet card ($25).  Their report was cryptic at best and when I called to get explanation of the charges, I had to spend hours talking to different people to get \"escalated\" up to a \"case manager\".  Then I was told VERY rudely, \"It costs what it costs.  For you to call up a company as big as HP and tell them they are wrong is crazy.\"  Now five months after that ordeal, the power connection to the AC adapter has stopped working.

Does anyone know how I can get rid of them, without losing access to Internet Exployer?  IE is one of the Browsers that I utilize, at times.  I would appreciate any advice, especially, if you know your solution works.  I had read some of the reviews regarding this computer, before I ordered it; and I must mention, that, I, really, don't have a problem with the keyboard, and lettering.  The computer was very easy to set up; and while setting it up, I was falling more and more in love with its feature's.  Also, I already have a computer with Windows Vista, and I have no problem with the program (Knock on Wood).

{"Title":"Same problem","Author":"Dudeskavich","ReviewID":"R1DMP96YBMY2OM","Overall":"bad","Content":"The keyboard is the stupidest design ever. I called HP to complain about the flaw in a dark brown colored keyboard that has lettering painted in a dark brown color, which makes typing anything, especially numbers, a serious hassle. What did the non technical support manager tell me? The keyboard is not a flaw, it was intentionally designed that way. If you don't like it, then you can return the product. Nice to see how HP is out to please the customer, when apparently they feel cocky and arrogant in this economy that they can tell a customer, \"If you don't like it, then buy something else.\" No more HP products for me, and by word of mouth I won't recommend their products to anyone else either.By the way, the same bronze colored computer sells at Sam's club, but with white letters on the keyboard. If it wasn't a design flaw, then why is the problem fixed on those computers sold at the retail giant?? My advice to anyone else is, complain to the CEO of HP, cause management doesn't care.","Date":"January 26, 2009"}

{"Title":"Incredible desktop replacement with upgrade options","Author":"Lee Allen","ReviewID":"R14Q32D1ONLTP2","Overall":"good","Content":"How do I start?  First the only negative things I have are the keyboard and touchpad.  As others have said, the contrast on the keyboard does cause one to scratch their head.  I learned how to type without looking, so it is not that much of a problem, but a problem it is in low light situations.  The touchpad is right where I rest my thumbs while typing.  The first thing I had to do was purchase a Logitech Nano mouse and turn off the touchpad so I take off one star.  Perfect solution.  Now the good.This baby comes with two (2) drive bays, what a pleasant surprise with only one occupied from my vendor.  When Windows 7 released, I pulled the original 5400 RPM 320 Gig drive and installed a 100 Gig SSD in the primary drive bay and a 7200 RPM 500 Gig drive for my data.  I also pulled the two 2 Gig memory chips and replaced them with two 4 Gig SO-DIMM DDR2 800 sticks for a total of 8 Gigs of memory.  This combination gave me a laptop some people would die for on their desktop.  A lot of bloatware does come with this unit so starting from scratch with Windows 7 64 Bit was almost a no brainer.  Some of the HP drivers for the entertaiment features, Bluetooth, Lightscribe DVD drive required additional downloads.  They weren't automatic, but the basic drivers are with W7.I built my own docking station using a 7 port USB hub, an ASUS VW246H Glossy Black 24\" 2ms(GTG) HDMI Widescreen LCD Monitor, and a Logitech MX 5500 Revolution Black Bluetooth Cordless Desktop.  Added a metal monitor stand for the monitor and the laptop fits nicely underneath with additional airspace underneath for additional cooling.  Now I have the ultimate road warrior.

The video card (an Nvidia 9600M GT) handles most modern gaming titles on low-to-moderate graphics settings.  I'm not aware of many notebooks below $1,000 that can play GTA 4 in medium resolution, but HP's dv7 definitely makes the grade here.  With the addition of a Blu-Ray ROM drive, the value of this machine becomes even greater.There's ample memory and processor power for handling most tasks with ease.  Even though the unit can be upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, I believe most users will find the 4 GB of included memory more than adequate.  The biggest performance killer is HP's Total Care Advisor, which I recommend un-installing once setup is completed.Another nice surprise was the machine's speakers.  Typical laptop sound systems are lacking in quality, but the dv7 is one of the best I have heard.  Having a sub-woofer on the bottom is probably what makes the difference.  Whether you're listening to music or watching a Blu-Ray movie, the enhanced audio capability is a nice addition.My only complaint is the silver, mirror-like touchpad.  It is a smudge magnet!  That's a relatively minor issue in my opinion, and certainly doesn't overshadow the tremendous overall value of the HP dv7.","Date":"April 25, 2009"}

I was not prepared for what a problem it was. Except under ideal conditions, the letters are virtually impossible to read. The letters just fade into the key background. Amazing. Someone at HP ought to be flogged for the key background/character color combination chosen. I solved it by buying a replacement keyboard (silver key background w/black characters). Cost was $28. The process of changing was a bit complicated even though I had found a web site with complete instructions. A lot of little screws to remove and the order components were removed matters. NOT a task to be taken lightly.It also came with Vista and I paid about $90 to upgrade to Windows7.Bottom line the $585 I paid for the computer ended up being $700 in total.It replaces a Dell E1705 Laptop. It is a decent computer for my needs and probably was a good buy, but not a painless way to save a few dollars.","Date":"January 7, 2010"}

{"Title":"Cool while it lasted.","Author":"onmlate","ReviewID":"R3XIUBXZ45UEB","Overall":"bad","Content":"The laptop lasted 29 months before it totally fried. The problem is the location of the vents. If you place it on a flat surface the computer gets more hot than any other laptop I've ever used. The vents are literally in the worst possible location they could be. The bronze finish shows fingerprints and makes it impossible to see the keys even in a slightly dim room. The heating issues lead to it running very slowly, randomly freezing and crashing, and not starting up even when plugged into a power source. It also would get extremely hot in two specific places: the upper left and lower left of the frame around the keyboard. It took forever to start up even when it was new. 5-7 minutes from the time you hit the \"On\" button until you're connected to a wireless network. The computer's fan is extremely noisy and runs constantly even when there is no dust to overheat the inner components (I looked). It comes loaded with bloatware and while I was pleasantly surprised with the AMD processor it's still nowhere near the speed of an Intel. Also, it's not real HD. Eventually the overheating made the motherboard fry which I can't say I'm too surprised about. The volume and wireless network buttons are a joke: a touchpad that you drag your finger across. It's really hard to adjust the volume without disconnecting from the network by accident. Also sometimes it doesn't sense your finger at first so you get a lot of annoying clicking sounds when it finally does.","Date":"September 14, 2011"}

Even with 8 GB of ram and a fast disc.It crawled through the initial setup and I finally had to shut it down late into the night before I could do the \"Factory Restore\". (It did recognize Double Layer DVDs and so did this important backup on only one.)It loads many-many-many promotional \"Try it, You'll like it!\" versions of all sorts of trash software and defaults to a lot of promoter's \"Foot-in-the-door\" software and services.The anti-virus is particularly intrusive taking up the screen with a large banner that can only be removed if you have previously loaded Windows Task Manager to END TASK. And then before you know it, it is back again, blocking the screen and intercepting the keyboard.Another intolerable \"Feature\" occurred the first day I used the machine (day 3). While I was online downloading data and images that were updated every three minutes, it suddenly took over the screen and announce that it was now going to proceed with \"part 3 of 5. DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER!\" and my broadband connection was dropped and the screen continued with that message.I have no idea what it was doing, so of course, I turned off the computer.It has done that twice more now but I am ready for it and turn off the machine before \"God-knows-what\" it will do to the computer (notice I didn't say \"MY computer\". I feel like I am not the owner/operator, but a mere bystander who paid for this.I won't go on with ALL of the harassment, but will leave with this: I CAN'T READ THE KEYBOARD UNLESS THERE IS A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINING ON IT.Their \"stylish design\" of bronze and tans looks very pretty but it gives us a tan keyboard with darker tan lettering.

Add on a subwoofer and you have yourself a nice machine.  If that is what you are looking for then this is the laptop for you.

Look through the laptop literature carefully - there is reference to an extended accidental damage warranty that can be purchased online for slightly over $100 a year.  It is a good idea if the laptop is going to travel around or be used by a younger person.  You can make restore disks one time - it takes 3 DVDs or about 17 CDs.

Yes, this laptop like all entry level laptops, was not really meant for gaming but lets face it, with today's technology, all entry level laptops can in fact play any game except for those out in the last year, when given enough of the associated resources.  Why does it not have the nvidia mobile video like its sister machines.2) advertising is suspect (putting it nicely); notice how the description says \"ready for tomorrow's 64-bit applications\" yet in typical stupidity, it is sold with the 32-bit version of Vista.  How are you supposed to run 64-bit apps like the add says, if you only have a 32-bit O/S?  You can't.3) only comes with 2gb of memory.  Hey, the max is four.  How much more can it really cost to add the extra 2GB?  Not much, memory is cheap today.  Having 4GB vs 2GB makes all the difference in running VISTA.  Vista is a nice snappy O/S, as long as you have enough memory.4) no hdmi out port.  I am OK with this I guess; not an issue if you are never hooking it to another monitor or tv.  It is after all an entry leve laptop.So in the end, another could have been.  Stick with the 212-us sister machine, it is the same machine (2.0GHz cpu) but has the 64-bit O/S and 4GB of memory and 8200m video.Hail Flavius","Date":"May 17, 2009"}

The only thing that took some getting used to was the keyboard is like a full 101 PC keyboard.  It has a full 10 key which shifts the QWERETY over a touch.I would recommend it and after owning it for 3 months, I would buy one again!  As far as the price goes, look around and don't pay about $420 for it.  You should be able to find this unit for around $399-$419 after rebates.","Date":"May 24, 2009"}

The built in speakers (Altec Lansing, located at top of keyboard near the screen) aren't great, but by laptop standards they are decent.The laptop's overall speed is pretty good, but the first thing I would do if invest another $60 and upgrade your RAM to the full 4GB.Keyboard isn't too loud.  The touchpad is nice and is built into the surrounding silver motif.  You also have a button to turn the touchpad on and off when you want which is nice.All of your ports are on the sides, as the rear of the laptop is made up of the hinge for the screen.  You get 3 USB, 1 Ethernet, 1 VGA, and a phone port.  There is no PCMIA, which is a bummer if you wanted to add a cellular wireless card, but we will live.The screen is bright, and built in HP software which is okay for beginners, is fairly easy to turn off and get out of the way.So considering the price, if you upgrade your RAM, I consider this a good machine for the price.","Date":"March 5, 2009"}

Only after the 5th or 6th time it's hit the floor from the table over the years did the screen actually crack.

Most laptops I've had in the past wore out and broke after only a year or two. A laptop we purchased alongside this model with the same specs crashed and broke after only a year and had to be replaced while the compaq kept strong. After two years the battery did die out on me and needed to be replaced but it was to be expected. And after four and half years the backlight on the screen died out but the computer, which is hooked to an external monitor until it can be fixed, still works wonderfully and just as new as it did five years ago. These types of breakdowns are to be expected but can be fixed without having to dish out for a whole new computer.So if you're looking for a computer worth its price and lasts this is the one you want. I highly recommend compaq brand computers as they're very durable past the expected lifespan of most laptops.","Date":"December 31, 2012"}

It is unbelievable.  I have to work with this system with an exterior mouse.  Which means the level of mobility for my laptop is limited since I have to use an external mouse. Even the controls to disable the pad do not work.

{"Title":"Pretty but....","Author":"A. Ortega","ReviewID":"R1Z8IFK98T1WZE","Overall":"bad","Content":"I fell in love with this machine the instant I saw its specs and looks in Amazon... I got it delivered and the first problem I had was that the computer was described as having an internal bluetooth antenna, which after searching how to start it for half and hour and chatting with HP I realized it was not there!  I got a discount from Amazon for this \"mistake\" which seems to happen quite frequently (I had the same problem with a Toshiba Satellite I purchased a while ago).  The 64bit Vista is rather problematic than helpful.  I am considering either upgrading to Ultimate or downgrade to 32bit.  Although its processor is ranked as \"genious\" and it brings 4gb of ram I have runned tests with my old Toshiba running 32 bit Vista with a slower processor and with half the ram and time after time my new HP gets beaten!!!!!!!!!!!!  I experience so many software related problems I cannot feel satisfied a single day about my purchase!  The speakers and volume control give so many problems as well: I place the laptop in \"mute\" and still I get a fraction of a second of the  beep of the instant messenger I use; the speakers are always making this noise like the power was just turned on; the volume control is non-responsive and then when it finally answers my command, it gets stuck both visually and audible.  I still doubt that this machine can be expanded up to 8gb of ram as the specs in Amazon advertise, but I have not checked this yet.  I guess I will get further disappointed... It's a shame that I feel this way for a laptop I found so captivating and (thought) powerful...  Now I bought an xb3000 expansion base (which is advertised as the compatible one for the dv6) and I found myself with the obligation to purchase a new A/C adapter since the laptop AC should work with the base but guess what? the dv6 AC is too big for the base!!! So there you can add $50 extra if you decide to get the whole bunch.  Bottom line: You can get the same performance with a cheaper, more convenient model and save yourself a lot of hassle...

Pretty normal and expected since I was turning it on for the very first time, right?Well, the 1st upgrade in the list was a BIOS upgrade, which I obviously downloaded and executed. The only problem was that the new HP Insyde BIOS flash utility for Windows Vista seems to be more of a threat than a utility. It simply popped-up a \"Verify Error\" message and completely frozen Windows and made the fan and HD run like crazy . Even the power button stopped working. The only way I was able to turn it off was by removing the battery. After that, the machine was completely dead! The power button didn't even light-up any of the machine's LED, not even the battery charging indicator.I chatted with HP \"support\" just to know that I'd need to send the laptop for maintenance. So I decided to return it to Amazon for replacement and now I don't intend to apply any BIOS upgrades from HP any time soon.UPDATE: DON'T EVER BUY THIS LAPTOP! IT'S PURE JUNK!I'm updating this review and downgrading this horribly built laptop to 1 star only (I wish there was a 0-star grade).After a few months, after I had already replaced it due to a bricked ROM, this laptop started to literally fall apart. The rubbers on the lid edges started to dissolve, I had to replace the original battery because it did not work anymore, some of the letters on the keyboard buttons became blurry because the black paint started to come off because of sweat, the left button in the touch pad \"sank\" and is not aligned with the right button anymore and most of its chrome-like coating came off as well.On top of all that, this thing is a fingerprint mess (both on the lid outside and on the keyboard and touch pad areas), it heats like hell (I can only use it over one of those laptop-cooler cushions) and its network adapters are rubbish: the Ethernet card, even though I bought it on 2009, is 100Mbps only (no Gigabit support) and its Broadcom wi-fi card is simply horrible!And I considered this laptop an expensive one (for a PC).

Does not seem to be as fast as the USB connector though.There is a remote control to run the tv function, but I have not been able to figure out how to get either to work, and I accidentally stumbled upon the slot to store the remote while i was looking for the slot to install a game card. No slot for the game card, but there is a place for the remote. none of this is illustrated in the internal documentation inside the pc. It might be in the paper manual, but if there was a paper manual in the box, i must have lost it.within a week of purchase, the screen started to flicker. I contacted HP email support and did what they told me. The flickering got better, for a couple of hours, then started up again. I contacted HP again by email, got more instructions, and the problem got worse. In frustration I called HP support and spoke to a female operative who gave me vague and incomplete instructions on resetting the BIOS. After a contentious exchange, she consented to send me a box to return the notebook for service. It will be gone for two weeks. HP continues to assure me that all the problems will be solved, but I am not optimistic. In addition to the screen issue, the Media Smart Resident TV program stopped working.I was also mistyfied why the screen saver would not start up as scheduled in the control panel, only to discover after two weeks and 3 friends that the screen saver cannot work if I have my external mouse plugged in.The Altec Lansing built in speakers are about as crummy as you would expect to find in a laptop.I am stuck with it now I guess.","Date":"May 12, 2009"}

When you combine with Compaq which is even worse, horrible results follow.  I can only strongly recommend that anyone looking for a laptop stay away from Compaq, HP and HP-Compaq machines.  My gf received this laptop two years ago to the day and it's totally dead right now.  Over the last 6 months it began developing a lot of problems.  The computer was never fast, always took forever to load up, had horrible internet service/wireless service and never seemed to measure up to what the specs were capable of.  Well The first problem we encountered was the laptop would start up with crazy checkered colours all over the screen and need several restarts to get going.  This was only 1/1/2 years into owning this junk.  Second about a month later the wireless card which was never impressive to begin with totally failed, so I had to buy a usb wireless adapter just to get it to work because it would be quicker than sending it to HP  for god knows how long.  The performance since the laptop was bought seemed to degrade rapidly until it was a pain in the neck to even use altogether.  A month or so after the wireless card failed the checkered colours started acting up again and upon restart the hard drive completely failed and will not boot up, the system powers on but cannot boot up the hard drive, it tries but it sounds like a car stalling out.  So in a nutshell this laptop barely lasted two years and was nearly unusable a year or so in.  I have never seen a HP yet that I was impressed with and now thank god my gf is turned from them as well.  I owned a Compaq laptop several years ago and an ACER with similar issues, so as stated I would strongly recommend looking at other brands and stay away from this poor quality, cheap unreliable hardware, over priced sham of a computer company know as HP-Compaq.","Date":"June 12, 2009"}

{"Title":"Quite possibly one of the worst laptops I've ever owned","Author":"The Gifted One","ReviewID":"R55KGZKWG9P3Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"Back in 2009 I purchased HP's so-called powerful high-performance HDX-16 Laptop.  I purchased one of the higher end ones.  Upgraded Specs were:- 2.53Ghz Core 2 Duo- 320GB HDD (after first year I upgraded this to a 500GB Seagate Hybrid SSD/- 6GB RAM- 1GB Nvidia GeForce GT 130MWent to the HP website and purchased this computer because it was supposed to be one of the best the company offered at that time.  Total cost after taxes came out to nearly $1,500.00.  I purchased it with the intention of it giving me good reliable performance for at least 4-5 years at a minimum.  When spending this kind of money on a computer, it's what a consumer would expect.INITIAL IMPRESSIONSFirst couple of months of owning the computer, it was wonderful.  Fast and reliable.  Large and beautiful 16\" screen.  It was very quiet and never even got very hot unless I played a highly demanding game on it.  It was very fast when it came to multitasking, video editing, and playing high intensity video games.  Initially I was extremely satisfied with the computer.AFTER FIRST YEARAround month 12-14 of owning this computer is when the problems started.  The multimedia bar at the top of the keyboard started malfunctioning.  Wi-Fi would constantly turn on and off on its own randomly while I'm using the net.  The volume controls would also turn themselves up and down randomly.  The battery failed around month 14 and already needed to be replaced.  The laptop fan began running extremely loud just from regular web-surfing.  It even started to run hot without even doing any demanding tasks.  Since it was past the magical one-year mark, HP did little to help and wouldn't even acknowledge most of these issues.  I cleared the laptop of all dust and bought a new battery in hopes of it helping the system.  It didn't change the heat nor the loud noise from the fans attempting to cool the system.  After researching online about this laptop, I discovered that other users had been having some of these same problems with this model laptop.  It came from the extremely cheap and low-quality parts HP used to make this machine.  At this point I felt it was best to just keep using this laptop despite it's problems since I paid so much money for it.YEARS 2-3 AND LAST DAYSA little after the full second year of having this computer, the replacement battery that I bought was pretty much dead again.  The laptop had began running louder and hotter than ever.  The media smart controls at the top of the keyboard were still running wild.  There periods of 30 straight minutes where the Wi-Fi would turn itself on and off over and over.  Making internet unusable for significant amounts of time.  The fingerprint reader still worked but there were times where it wouldn't respond and it was quicker to just type in your password manually.  Just as in the first year, HP would not acknowledge these problems.  Eventually I just became fed up with this computer.  A $1500 machine that only performed well for about 11 months is unacceptable.  This 3 year experience left me completely disappointed and angry with HP.  I will never again buy one of their products and cannot recommend them for anyone else who plans on using their machine for over a year.  I had decided to get an Apple Macbook Pro (2011) and to sell the HP HDX for whatever value it still had.  As if the disappointment from the machine itself wasn't enough, I had discovered that my grand $1500 machine deteriorated to barely being worth around $250 after only 3 years.  Most computer places didn't want to buy the machine at all.  Right now I couldn't be happier with my MacBook and a company who actually cares about their consumers concerns.FINAL THOUGHTSIf you're in the market for a new laptop, I have to strongly recommend you stay away from HP.  At least stay away from their so called \"high-end\" machines.  I honestly would not spend more than $300 on one of their machines.  I've had underwhelming laptops before but to spend $1500 on one that performs well for barely a year is pathetic and a disgrace.  If you're only a casual user looking to surf and use Facebook, then their low end machines might be ok.  Otherwise go with someone else.","Date":"May 15, 2012"}

The HDX 16 model has an hardware problem with its touchbar control strip ( Those lit up buttons for PLAY FORWARD STOP VOLUME CTRL et al ). This thing automatically starts flashing  VOLUME BASS TREBLE on your screen no matter what you are doing, be it typing or web surfing or watching a movie on a DVD. If you are on the web it delays all keyboard inputs, same for MS word, making you miss some letters when you type. Its common problem reported by so many people all over the internet. Just type \"HDx 16 volume bass treble\" in google search and you will know what I am talking about. There no decent solution to this problem (HP support have ultimately asked people to format their hard drive (an insane soln) and still it doesn't solve the problem . The only way it stops is if you open the laptop and remove the ribbon connector to the media control strip , but this also means you will no longer be able to use your built in wireless card (because wireless ON/OFF button is in that touch strip).

A. You can get used to the glossy screen and it no longer bothers me and B. It's an 16\" laptop... what did you expect!What I do mind, however, is being taken advantage of. It has been less than a year and so far I've had the motherboard replaced and now the HDD died. In both cases the problem was a defect that HP were apparently aware this model has. However, they didn't bother to notify anyone. Instead they quietly stopped selling them (if you check, you'll see that HDX18-1180US, HDX16-1140US and HDX X16-1160US are all unavailable). As a result I've lost documents and personal files that cannot be restored. I know, I know, I should have backed everything up, but a notification that something like this could happen to my brand new laptop would have been useful.I live overseas so the support guys here have been great. I can't really complain. And it's true that this laptop's product description is quite impressive. While it worked, it worked perfectly.

I mean, REALLY lucky.2) You use it moderately, cutting down the inevitable wear and tear.3) You haven't had it for very long.In the first three months of having this computer, I could've screamed its praises from a sky scraper. And then the honeymoon ended.I will give some positives first: Screen size, clarity and overall display are great. It is relatively easy to navigate through all the functions and accessories.Okay, with that outta the way:I got my laptop customized direct from HP. I spent a small fortune to make sure I had all the speed, memory, and functionality I could want and then some. I got the Blu-Ray drive with lightscribe, upped the graphics, got the 12-cell battery, and upgraded the OS. And for three months, I thought, \"gosh I'm glad I didn't settle and get that macbook.\"After three months, the technical/mechanical glitches began. I needed the dvd/blu-ray drive replaced. The audio program and  panel began interfering with internet connection-- that's just odd. Mouse pad stopped functioning completely and I found out that this happens on these models. To fix it you have to send it away if you're under warranty or pay to replace it on your own. Either way, you're giving up your computer for a while. So I use a wireless mouse. Not by choice.The external power socket... expanded. The cord won't stay in on its own anymore. I literally have to rig it. How's that for janky? Not only janky but since it's hard to rig, charging became more difficult (as the cord would pop out with the slightest movement), and this led to a 12-cell battery losing capacity. What was once 3 hours of unplugged usage time now comes in at about 20 minutes and then without warning it dies. At least it used to warn me so I could save my work!!!I HAD to invest in a wireless mouse, but no way am I spending $ on a new laptop battery or anything else to band-aid the problems this thing has. I've also spent more time than I care to recall troubleshooting these and additional hardware and software issues.I've read a number of reviews of this and similar models and it seems like the same problems arise around the same time. I've had this NB for under two years. . . I am already shopping around for a replacement. It won't be HP. Nothing HP ever, ever again. Heed reviews, people!

After looking on the Internet for \"HP Laptop won't turn on\" I find that this is a very common issue with HP laptops.So her laptop is dead (I suspect the motherboard) and now we have to see how to get it fixed by HP, whose customer support is below mediocre.  Not a good purchase at all, buy a Macbook and run Windows 7 - better hardware and support.UPDATE October 20, 2009: Today I called HP and they told me that they will NOT honor the warranty directly, that I must contact Amazon so they can send the computer to HP, which is ridiculous.  So pretty much, if you buy this computer through Amazon, HP will NOT honor their warranty.","Date":"September 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"Nice laptop, but can not recommend","Author":"Curtis","ReviewID":"R1GPLW3PCR0O4X","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have had the HP laptop for about 2 years. There are many great things about the laptop I enjoy, but a single major design flaw forces me to not recommend the pc.I bought the pc for the graphics capability. Unfortunately, the laptop can not handle the heat generated from using the higher graphics capabilities. Sure, you can watch videos or play games, but eventually, the PC will over heat and then shut off without notice. Also, try watching a video when the PC heats up to about 150 degrees. It is not very comfortable. I thought buying one of those plastic pads with a usb fan would solve the issue. But, even with the additional cooling capability, the PC will still overheat and shut off. If you do not believe me, then search overheating problems for this PC online. notice in all the responses, not a single word from HP on how to fix the issue. I have even talked to other users with the same PC and they have the same issue.Overall, the HP HDX is a fine machine with lots to like about it. But as I said, the over heating issue should over ride anything else. It's sort of like buying the best car ever built, but has no brakes. You may like every thing else about it, but that single issue means you should never purchase the car.And given HP does not appear to have a fix (thus the cone of silence from them), move on to another maker (apparently, many of the HP's have the issue).","Date":"June 27, 2011"}
{"Title":"Detailed problem description.  BUYERS BEWARE!","Author":"Jeremy R. Higashiyama \"BlackberryJer\"","ReviewID":"R3NFPLCSWO91J3","Overall":"bad","Content":"I would first like to start out by saying that I take very good care of my computers and I do everything in my power to keep them dust free, dirt free, kept up to maximum performance. Now, I barely got this computer about a year ago, I bought it brand new from HP.  When I first received it in the mail, it looked amazing and had an awesome design.  Right out of the box, I turned it on and when Windows Vista was finished doing the setup for the first start, my volume kept going up and down, my wifi kept turning on and of, and bass and treble kept going up and down.  First thing I though was that there are updates.  I updated all my drivers and the problem still kept continuing.  First thing I did was call HP and it took me an hour to even get to tech-support.  They told me that I needed to send in my laptop under warranty, that right there should of been a sign to return it and I still regret not doing it.  So within 3 days I received a box in the mail to send in my laptop, I sent it in, I got a call a couple days later and received it before the week was through.  By the way, I will give it to HP on being fast as all the other computer companies usually take at least 2 weeks, at least the companies I dealt with.  So I get it back, and the problem stopped happening for a little over a month, but in just 2 months alone, I started seeing problems that put this notebook to shame.  On the top of the list,1. OVERHEATING!!!  Even saying that is an understatement.  When people talk about the notebook being hot and overheating, they aren't kidding.  It has 2 fans, a big one and a little tiny one.  The small one is on the bottom right next to the hard drive.  You can't access it easily to make sure its working or clean it at all.  Then the vent where its sucking air in, is only half its size.  With that being said, the fan works half as effective as a full vent opening would be for it.  Note:  YES, I get this is a more powerful computer, but if it gets so hot at the bottom that your legs are burning, don't you see that as being a problem?  This overheating is just plain ridiculous because, A.  Its not cooling anything off inside if there isn't enough cool air in it, and B, its also causing heat damage to other things, as the air isn't circulating enough in there.  Most people think a lot of us HDX 16 1140US users are over exaggerating this issue, but really, were not.  Right now the current temperatures areGPU: 60CHD: 41CTemp 1: 52CCore 0: 68CCore 1: 67CI also have a notebook cooler  under it, and I used speedfan to find my temps out.  Also it is about 72F in my room right now.Other problems that arise are :2. Battery wouldn't charge3. Screen starts flashing for no reason.4. Touch pad and click buttons started chipping, and the left and right click buttons stopped working and the buttons ended up popping off within a week of each other. Including the double tap.5. HP forgot a bunch of screws when they sent it back to me and the speaker grill keeps popping off.6. They changed the original webcam out with some cheaper cam and when your in a lighter room, the screen for the person seeing you on cam, just turns white.7. The screen gets a whole bunch of dents and scratches because the keyboard keys rub on it.  After HP fixes it, they send you a little note stating that you need to use a little cloth they is sent with your notebook when you first received it to protect it from scratches like that.8. The keyboard keys paint started chipping off too.9. My hard drive took a dump on me while I was in the middle of transfering my stuff to an external drive.  It started making this clicking sound and then a weird beeping sound and then while transferring my stuff over to my external, my computer froze and shut down.10.  Windows Vista.  Vista is a great idea, for a more powerful computer.  If you have Vista loaded on it, then there is no way your going to get any good battery life and performance at the same time.  You have to have it set in high performance if you want to do the simplest of tasks otherwise, its going to be extremely slow.11. HP's customer service, tech-support, and Case Managers.  This is an interesting one for me as I had not spoken to anyone but customer service and a supervisor(Who was the most rude person I have ever dealt with for a computer company) When I called  to ask to speak to someone higher, they opened a case and I had to wait 3 days for a case manager to call me back to explain the problems that have risen since I first received.  He seemed to help me alot and try to get it resolved but, when it came down to finding him to tell him there was a delay with my local FedEx, it was impossible, and they rejected my notebook for warranty repairs when it got there.  As of now, its been just about a year and I have had to many problems that one should deal with in a company as big as HP.  They do not treat their customers well, tech-support is VERY rude because they believe that you don't know anything and thats the reason why your sending your notebook in.In all honesty, yes, when in high performance , it does work fairly well, but if your not into the idea of having a hot laptop,  bad battery life,  or no durability, then I suggest looking into another company such as Toshiba or Sony's Vaio notebooks.All the problems could have been easily fixed if HP wouldn't have put the fan intake in such a horrible spot.  its in the top left hand side and if you have it in your lap, you for sure are going to be blocking it.  The problems that I posted are all  mainly heat issues and when my hard drive died, that really set me off with HP.  My last year of work which took hours upon hours to work on, are now gone because the hard drive pooped out on me.  Right now, I am furious with HP, and will NEVER buy a laptop from them again.For the people that say,\"Backup your work!\"  It's a laptop, not a desktop, its harder for the people that don't stay at a desk all day too do this.  For me alone, I am never using this at a desk when I am at home and rarely use it at home as its my music computer for writing music.Overall that, I will admit there are some pro's.The screen is amazing as its VERY soft on the eyes so it makes it easy to spend an extended amount of time on it without your eyes bugging out and turning all red.  The touch bar works great when its finally working right, the fingerprint reader is GREAT for the ones that try getting into your computer, the keyboard is perfect with the whole number pad on the side making it almost a full sized keyboard, the sound is almost as good as toshiba's notebooks but thats only because they have Harmon/Kardon speakers, also the bass sounds really good compared to the full treble most laptops have, and it runs great with games.  But from now on I will only be buying Toshiba computers as I still to this day have never had a problem like this with them.  Take my advice, spend the extra money to get something that will last longer and run better, these problems are not worth it in the end, and you end up paying over $100.00 for the hard drive when it dies, and I still have to find a touch pad that can replace my current, buttonless one.  Trust me, you'll regret it within a year if you do buy it.  Also, look into HP's notebooks having overheating issues.  They have been known to have the issues for a while now.","Date":"July 20, 2010"}

After over two frustrating months I can only report about poor reliability and extremely ineffective service. My new HDX Laptop still has major performance issues and the horizon looks bleak. I am considering making this purchase a total lose in order to save me from wasting many more hours of my time.Out of the box the laptop looked promising. for instance HP decision to scarify proper aspect ratio for the display in order to achieve high resolution at a lower cost seems reasonable (it uses standard HDTV screen rather than WXGA). Immediately it was obvious that performance was mediocre at best in spite of ordering the highest available options for my configuration (processor, memory, hard drive, etc. all superior to the listing above). Documentation was not helpful like directing me to unavailable features and options for the embedded webcam.I failed my first task of connecting my new HP laptop to my new HP printer. It is missing an essential HP driver that apparently was supposed to be install at the factory. After eight weeks and 50 (yes fifty!) hours of my time and similar effort from HP, the only option I have, is to start from scratch and install the initial factory configuration for the software myself. Since it takes numerous hours to proceed the inital configuration with missing updates, software configuration choices, installation of my own software, etc., I wonder if I should invest any more time in this computer. At this moment, the reason for the faulty factory installation is not on HP service map yet (likely a faulty sector on my new hard drive). Thus my odds to continue a long expensive path in reviving my sick new computer looks high.Since we are at the age of paying relatively little for much functionality and performance one must face the high probability of requiring support. If you like to follow excessive useless long laundry instruction lists (looked canned to me) of re-installing existing software that works fine, email HP Support and ask for help. If you enjoy long aimless frustrating discussions with mostly nice people but with lack of knowledge, ability, responsibility, or authority (probably the combination of all), than buy HP products. I can assure you that you will meet many people from the Philippines and India with various impressive job titles.While generating a rich set of service records, I was wandering how can HP afford to spend so much time and effort with a single customer on a single product with very low profit margin. Perhaps that is the reason why HP cut corners more aggressively than others. My personal cursory inquiry and Consumer Reports survey suggest that Lenovo is a better choice for laptops.","Date":"April 25, 2009"}

None of my people could use this laptop, even the touch-typers because they still needed to be able to see what the function keys do.(The function keys seem to be different on every laptop.)  I have returned this as it is unusable as shipped and you can't tell by the picture how hard it is to see the keys.","Date":"May 14, 2009"}

{"Title":"For what it is intended to do...not bad","Author":"S. Melvin","ReviewID":"RZ8TL0OLYPR8J","Overall":"bad","Content":"Update: this particular model has a serious issue with heat. The internet is rife with compaints about the laptop failing to boot due to an \"overheat condition\" which is a fault that can only be fixed by HP or a trained tech who can bypass the heat fault. Mine experienced this issue and even with the new board and heatspreader it still died. I initially rated this a 4 of 5, but after realizing how bad the design on this laptop is, especially if you have this issue and have to take it apart, I have lowered my review to a 2 of 5. This major flaw is a show stopper for HP, which seems to be ignored through various models. Be forewarned!The laptop is similar to so many other basic laptops in this price range from the major manufacturers that it is hard to distinguish one from another.  The monitor is nice, the layout is alright and the overall feature set is not bad (camera, HDMI, remote, etc).  Overall, my initial impression (just pulled out of box this weekend and spending my initial time updating, installing and removing software) are that for the money, it will do exactly what we intend it to do--surf the internet, handle last and some current generation games, watch movies and provide access while on the go.  This is certainly not a desktop replacement, nor should it be treated like one.Pros: weight, camera, OS (64-bit should be the new standard), video card (for integrated anyway), and finally the HDMI and other connectors.Cons: lack of installation software (standard HP practice is to make you make your own copies using DVD backups, which is silly since you bought the dang license), weird molded corners that look/feel cheap, crapware (okay, HP and most other major manufacturers do this to offset the cost of the machine, which is a hassle when you first pull your new machine out of the box, but nothing that can't be fixed using some very simple uninstall assistance--I personally like [...] to remove all the stuff I don't need or want).Overall: for ~$600 with rebates and Amazon pricing it's not a bad machine for the basics of computing while on the go or from the comfort of our couch.  Great little feature set that should last you a while or at least until you're ready to move up to a more powerful laptop for a higher price.","Date":"May 23, 2009"}

I really love the way it operates - it's easy to use and a great size. However, within a couple months, the fan started running really loud. I have updated the BIOS, restored it - a multitude of things - and still the fan runs as if it's a jet taking off, even when no programs are running. I wouldn't recommend this laptop simply for that factor, and right now I'm in the market to replace it.","Date":"June 3, 2011"}

I bought two 19.00 1 gig memory modules to upgrade them to 2 gig.  The back panel is a little tricky to remove, so be careful.  Otherwise, the design is solid and this D620 is a much better acquisition than a Netbook, in my opinion, as the 4 pound 14 inch monitor is light but not at all bulky.They are well worth the three hundred dollars with DVD read-writable/Vista Home Basic, etc.  They are made of solid plastic and unless you drop them they should be fine.As for selling one for 499.00?  Well, there are probably fifty better laptops in between 299 and 499 you could buy.a D620 only has2 USB ports and no webcam and with only 1 gig, they are a deal at 299.00, not a deal at much more than that.jhA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez","Date":"December 29, 2008"}

No longer for creative Professionals","Author":"Nick \"CellGeek\"","ReviewID":"R1YV1AYHEWP7TH","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}

{"Title":"No Apple Phone support for this amazon purchase","Author":"Jam \"Jam\"","ReviewID":"RQL9BCNNWWU00","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this from Amazon, (Config:2.66Ghz 6M-L2 cache/320G hdd/ 4Gb Ram).1. When I tried to get apple 90 day phone support, Apple recognizes the serial number as 4 month old, so no help in configuring any network/firewall. I'm a first time mac user, switching from PC.2. Apple dropped the price on this item by about 400 dollars. I cannot exchange with Amazon, or get a refund, although I'm within the 30 day return period. They want a minimum 15% restock fee. Just got off the phone with a Codie B, supervisor at Amazon customer service. They are absolutely no help, wish I had bought this at my local BEST BUY, where there is price match/guarantee.3. I'm very disappointed that Amazon treats a loyal regular customer this way. Now ex-customer.All rantings and frustration aside, This is a Fantastic Product from Apple. Being a first time Mac user, coming from a predominantly Linux and Windows world, the mac hardware is the tops. Not to mention Leopard, has everything I need. I eventually set up my firewall,( ipfw script with a startup plist in /System dir). As I come from a Unix b/g, I'm comfortable with configuration, a little phone help from apple would have been much appreciated, and deserved, after paying so much.I rate 1 star for my experience with buying this from Amazon.The product itself would rate 5 stars.I had done a lot of research, before buying, and nobody else offers the same top level hardware and OS that will do everything you ask of it.Some of the goodies, out of the box, like, In built VNC(server and client), SMB print/file sharing, Security, and amazing speed. Top that with no extra anti-virus s/w or subscriptions to purchase like some other OSes. I get a battery duration of about 5.5 hours, when I just browse/read. The list goes on, DiskUtility that can resize and partition without destroying data, multi-touch trackpad while reading, very small os memory footprint,  Xcode looks very promising... I found a freeware utility that will \"burn\" Audio-DVD too, along with other formats.Apple has a this approach, of exposing elegant and minimal menus on the outside to users, but as we dig deeper, are rewarded with more and more details. As you delve deeper, more details and options are available.All in all my personal opinion: If you are planning to buy this, look at the new 15inch, 2.8 Ghz configuration, it has the same 6Mb L2 cache, that's touted as the number one reason for performance increase by Intel. Just dont buy from Amazon. :-)","Date":"June 11, 2009"}

But, the screen is constantly flickering and the flickering becomes worse with each passing week. There are thousands of articles on the Internet about users experiencing similar problems due to defective NVIDIA chips in these machines. I've spent hours on the phone with Apple Support and they refuse to accept the machine for repair because I cannot force it to flicker on demand and they won't acknowledge the problem as their responsibility if it is intermittent in nature. I wrote to Apple corporate legal directly and they ignored my letter and sent it back to customer service for a boilerplate reply. Unfortunately, when I pay full retail to buy a machine at this price point, and I'm treated like this, it's impossible to offer more than a 1 star review.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dead Pixel's are common","Author":"John Doe","ReviewID":"R2M0ZJ5P8GS6RD","Overall":"bad","Content":"I gave this one star mainly to bring attention to a common MBP problem.  My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be \"Materially Defective\" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.  In all other ways I am very happy with the MBP as I am a convert from Dell.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

Generally, Apple products have good ideas but poor engineering.Negatives- My spacebar stopped working a few weeks into actually using this laptop. I had to pry it off so I can touch the sensor directly in order to type this review. If you look at how the keyboard was designed from the inside, it's not surprising that it has issues.- The dual-link dvi cable (after waiting for months for it to come out after being on back order) wigs out and starts displaying junk on 30\" monitors. Apple later declared retroactively that the cable will only work on Apple branded 30\" monitors. A lot of people are upset about this.- Given the size of the screen, the screen real-estate (measured in pixels) is very small. Especially sucks if your 30\" monitor is dead in the water.- The edges of the laptop are sharp.- The laptop only opens to ~130 degrees,- Runs hot.- Fan goes crazy if the bottom is covered up.- Optical drive makes noise everytime you wake the laptop.","Date":"January 20, 2009"}
{"Title":"Over priced under proforming computer.","Author":"Deimos \".\"","ReviewID":"R22YZ1TR7WPRHX","Overall":"bad","Content":"OK so I have used both versions of Macbook pro and I can attest to the fact that there is no way in hell that this system is worth nearly 3000$. OS X is a so so OS, the system runs ok same as any other MAC I guess. I bought an ACER Extenza 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM, 320gb HD w. Vista Home Premium and it's way faster then the macbook pro. At which time I realized that the macbook pro had cost me three times as much for less performance and speed...plus no games and minimal apple only applications/software. For the price macbook pro's should be a hell of alot faster. Plus in a few years....good luck upgrading. The DVD/CD rom drive sucks because unlike my ACER or any PC/laptop it doesen't have the eject button right on the dvd drive, so if your MAC locks up (which it will) there's no way to eject the cd/dvd (yes I tried to keyboard eject button) with the mac locked up it's useless. I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple. No MAC is worth the asking price, they are generally slower than any PC/Windows based Laptop I have ever compared it too and are severly limited compared to windows users. Save your money, buy a high end windows laptop and a PC together for less then what Apple wants for their Macbooks. Next off, as stated this laptop is half as fast as an ACER Extanza or Gateway T-Series with the same specs. The pro gets boiling hot when running simple apps, and even gets so hot it could damn near start a fire, it's hot enough that you can bearly stand to touch it near the battery and under the screen/keyboard. It can't run windows for crap, even with boot camp. I boot camped Windows XP and the mac pro had an extremely hard time running it, taking forever to boot up and shut down, im talking like 10 mins. That goes to show that windows based laptops (PC's) are faster and better. Little heat, top notch speed (totally smoked the macbook pro easily). A mac runs OS X duh good but can't even handle XP......sad. Mac sucks. Overpriced BS.","Date":"January 29, 2009"}

I expected something that was worth every penny because all the Apple products I purchased in the past, I would have paid double what I paid, because the design and functionality is so nice and it's a quality product.  The NEW Macbook Pro 15.4 inch does look nice, is high quality made, etc.Pros:1.Mousepad is very cool.2.Design is very nice. It is pretty light.3.Sound is pretty good.4.Magnetic battery plug is awesome.5.Battery life is amazing and can be charged 1000 times.6.Slot-loading DVD drive is great.7.Keypad is pretty nice and backlit.8.Fantastic quality iCamera.Cons: The reasons I am returning this product.1.When you type in wordpad, and try to print it, it is so small not even a magnifying glass could fix.  I tried messing around with the word wrap and stuff, but with the price of this notebook, this is not right.2.Price3.Latch on back is almost too easy to open and get to the hard drive, etc.4.Only 2 USB Ports, what are they thinking?5.No HDMI Port6.Hardly any products are made for MAC still, they are all windows only.7.Text in Safari is very hard to read just like Textedit.I've read all the reviews on the laptop and I feel that most people are just Mac Fanboys and don't give honest reviews.  I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback). God loves you.","Date":"February 26, 2009"}

And that is true, only you have to remember one aspect of that: they are great WHEN they are working properly.Mine has had three serious problems in just one year. The first happened right out of the box, the logic board came with some kind of malfunction and Apple had to change it. Two months after that the problem was with the internal microphone, and again bring it to apple to fix it...now, just as the one year guarantee ended, another important problem, this time with the magic pad. This time, however, not even apple knows for sure what is happening, and if you browse on blogs, you will see that a lot of people experience the same as I am now experiencing, and no clue to how to solve. I am sure that whoever read this and had not experienced any problem will say I was not lucky with my equipment, that they NEVER had any problem, etc...but the fact is, apple does have a lot of problems, with a lot of its customers and, what is worse, the problems in a Mac, when they do happen, are ALWAYS harder to fix than in a PC. That is the reason they so strongly encourage you to  buy the apple protection plan, for another 200 bucks.But I have to confess. When everything is ok, the product is nice to use it, has great performance and great looks. Perhaps you are lucky and will not fall into the negative statistcs as I did, but if you do, you will agree with me that their products are good, not great and their support is far from great, if the problem is not easely fixed.

Stated in slightly different terms; what is it that justifies paying the Apple \"premium\"?First, great design.Second, a very gook operating system.Third, excellent product support widely available on a walk-in basis.

However, the glare that I am experiencing is intolerable, especially when the Web page has a black background.  I tried a matte anti-glare screen protector but to no avail.  The protector removed the glare but caused white backgrounds to be extremely pixelated, so much so that my eye strain was even worse than without the screen protector.  I am not against all glossy screens...I love my Macbook Air's screen.  However, the extra layer of glass on the Macbook Pro causes these horrible reflections that can not be mitigated by adjusting the screen angle.  Furthermore, even at the brightest setting, I see both the keyboard and my hands reflected in the black, glass covered bezel.  Perfect solution would be to use museum glass or no glass at all with a black, non-reflective bezel.  When Apple offers that, I will buy it.

Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers. I have been Amazon's loyal customer, and even though we are not rich, we bought over 3000 dollars of goods in the past 3 months from Amazon. I swear to my mother's life, that no longer will I do business with Amazon, after this past 10 hell days. I have spent over 19 hours on the phone, and have been so upset the other day, I thought I am having a heart attack, and guess what it is still not over, and I have to deal with it another 10 days. Just for one deal. Then people say what is wrong with corporate America? This is it, lack of care, and do not giving a DAM what your customer feels, and goes through. If I would have decided the other day to go through Apple (even though their laptop price was 10 dollars less), and was not a loyal customer of Amazon, I would have been using my laptop 1 week, and already was used to it, and on top of that I would have not spent 1 hour with some Joe Shmo on Philippines, day in, and day out.SAHAME ON AMAZON to take of customers like me and my wife this way, SHAME.Robert Shah","Date":"September 14, 2009"}

I say trying because when your not always trying to fix it, restart it, unfreeze it, cleaning it for trojans, wondering why the track pad wont work, wondering why the keyboard stopped working, wondering why it's losing your important company data and crashing when you don't even touch it for a day or so you may actually get to try and use it.  The idea behind this D830 makes me laugh.....a \"durable\" outer shell to protect junk hardware, I can see in a Mac protected by aluminium housing but not this Dell garbage.  Since I have been composing this review on My Macbook Pro which I do most of my work on now that I have the D830, the D830 just froze up again:  no mouse, no keyboard, shutdown option greyed out.....sigh, such junk.  I guess that's why the techs here myself included have to take Dell pc/notebook repair courses from Dell so we can fix our work computers all day and maybe get some work done, this is bull.  The only thing the D830 is good for is a coaster or a riser for your Mac.  Funny thing is every Dell I have owned showed the same issues within 6 months, XPS, Inspirion, Inspirion Mini, and the unholy Dell Latitude series.  For work this thing is a complete piece of junk, company programs without malware on them barely work or run, for anything else it's also slow and clunky compared to better, lighter, higher quality lines of notebooks.  The display is also very dull and not worth the money.","Date":"November 25, 2009"}

{"Title":"Bittersweet machine","Author":"Sarah","ReviewID":"R1QNONEKJBICUL","Overall":"bad","Content":"I actually got my Sony Vaio N-series from Best Buy. However, I felt complied to write about my experience with my machine.Wanting a inexpensive laptop for college, I got a Sony Vaio N-Series. At first I thought, \"this thing rocks!\" A large screen, nice roomy keyboard. By the end of the semester my thoughts changed dramatically.First thing that charged my opinion on Sony: I accidentally dropped a small aerosol can of hair mousse on my lappy. The force was so great that the hard drive \"popped out\" of place. The campus technology director said that cannot be the case...usually laptop hard drives are protected to vast degrees. A small, light weight can should not have dislodged the hard drive. Long story short the hard drive had to be replaced via the dislodged--all from a 7oz can of hair mousse. Apparently Sony can really protect them hard drives!Second thing: The battery life. On one charge the battery lasts about 45 minutes. That's with the screen dimmed.Lastly: The plug-in wall charger. It's been three years since I took my laptop out of the box. For about two years the charger worked great...fully energized the laptop etc. Until this year. One day, while doing my daily web page viewing, the charger \"blew-up\" and refused. I had to purchase an after-market replacement. Just my luck, so I thought. However, a few days ago my mom's (more expensive) Sony Vaio charger blew-up as well. So it is not just me.Do not get me wrong. Sony has created some awesome products and other laptops. However, my Sony laptop experience is nothing spectacular.","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

{"Title":"The battery life kills this product","Author":"Steven N. Vaughn","ReviewID":"R1XM5JCZWKOE19","Overall":"bad","Content":"The packaging is beautiful and the size is wonderful. The battery life is simply not good enough to make the product useful to me.Booting the machine is painfully slow. It takes something like 5 minutes for a complete boot. If you want to tinker with registry and stuff maybe this could be reduced a bit.What I want is a PC that acts like a cell phone: you open the cover and it is ready to go. 5 minute boot is not acceptable in that scenario.You can avoid the boot by making the system sleep/hibernate when you close the lid. It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert.My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive. I'm seriously wondering if I can find someone who would trade a Kindel DX for the Sony.","Date":"October 8, 2009"}

Definitely for someone that is travelling a lot and needs a lite, stylish and connected computer - this is IT.However, there are negative elements that you may consider in your purchase decision:- Microsoft Vista makes it a VERY slow computer, with a lower than average performance index - including regular start-up, launching programs, video sub-optimal (I cannot watch iTunes or YouTube videos in normal conditions);- touch pad and stick are very sensible - I had to disable them and use and external nano USB mouse;- screen size is too small, text is very hard to read;- GPS application is crashing often, the wireless/connectivity dashboard has to  disabled to use the mouse correctly;- Internet Explorer 7 is crashing regularly, I had to use Firefox, Safari or Chrome.- short battery life - about 1 hour with only one wireless connection on (all others and GPS are off);- there are not useful productivity or multimedia applications installed, however there are all kind of obscure things pre-installed that take a lot of space;- Microsoft OneCare is very slow and clunky;- price is high, accessories are expensive, not a good value.Overall, this netbook is not worth the price, better value and performance may be found in Asus eee PC or Acer Aspire One.","Date":"April 5, 2009"}

I am surprised that Sony would use Vista operating system for this. Don't they have quality control? The product is almost unusable under Vista.SOLUTION: Downgrade to XP then you will have function and style.","Date":"February 17, 2009"}

Mc Dermott Manrique \"UmanaMD\"","ReviewID":"RBABAZUTZ9JWQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this Sony Vaio after having own othe Vaio laptops for a long time and being worry free.  But with this one, after just six months of use, it just stop working.  Took it to the local authorized Sony dealer and they told me the mother card was damaged and that the repair was going to cost almost the same as this laptop cost me.  Since I Bought it from outside the US, I've been having trouble getting a second oppinion.  Too bad for a product like this one.","Date":"April 8, 2010"}
{"Title":"The battery life kills this product","Author":"Steven N. Vaughn","ReviewID":"R1XM5JCZWKOE19","Overall":"bad","Content":"The packaging is beautiful and the size is wonderful. The battery life is simply not good enough to make the product useful to me.Booting the machine is painfully slow. It takes something like 5 minutes for a complete boot. If you want to tinker with registry and stuff maybe this could be reduced a bit.What I want is a PC that acts like a cell phone: you open the cover and it is ready to go. 5 minute boot is not acceptable in that scenario.You can avoid the boot by making the system sleep/hibernate when you close the lid. It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert.My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive. I'm seriously wondering if I can find someone who would trade a Kindel DX for the Sony.","Date":"October 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"Pretty, but not functional.","Author":"Notebook User","ReviewID":"R1ZAZARKIDSUKF","Overall":"bad","Content":"My wife bought a green one because she liked the color and style.  Yes, it is stylish and lightweight, and easy to carry (fits perfectly into her favorite handbag!).  But every time I use it, I get so frustrated with its slow speed that I want to just toss this thing out the window.  Apparently there is no system malfunction, applications are kept to minimal, and the power-saving mode is set to high performance (at the expense of battery hours), but it is still too slow.  Small notebooks coming out of Taiwan in recent years cost less than 1/2 of this unit, and they are more than twice as fast.  If you are looking to make a fashion statement, then go for this Vaio.  If you are after a lightweight notebook that is practical and functional, then stay away.","Date":"October 4, 2010"}
{"Title":"Don't Buy it Now","Author":"G. H. Lo","ReviewID":"R6BCXILU4HZ06","Overall":"bad","Content":"This laptop is good but it isn't great, the pointing stick is really sensitive, and the keyboard is really easy to adjust to, but it is very easy to leave fingerprints on the cover; nonetheless, this is good machine.The US version comes with the Intel Atom 1.33GHz, but the Japanese version as well as the ones in Hong Kong come with the option of choosing Intel Z520 1.33GHz, Z530 1.6GHz, and Z540 1.86GHz. Once again the US isn't getting the \"right\" stuff, for some reason US will also have this lag in presenting us the product we wanted. I also asked one of the sales representative, and he says there will be an upgraded version in US, but it's going to take awhile, so don't waste your money now and wait for the upgrades or you could choose to buy the Japanese version, which is available in many websites.","Date":"February 7, 2009"}

{"Title":"Problems since day one!","Author":"M. Parrish \"adiva4real\"","ReviewID":"RZZQ6DMW8258G","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this computer in March 2009.  First of all, it's over priced, you should get at least 120gb hard drive!  Half the space is already gone before it's delivered to your door.  The screen is pretty small, it's really hard to read at times, you can increase the screen size on Windows Explorer but that makes it hard to navigate through the pages. Secondly, I can never use it for an extended amount of time because it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot !  I haven't loaded anything on it because there isn't room so I'm not taking up any space.  It also crashes and reboots on its own, I'll get some kind of crazy blue screen.  Also, regardless of where I am, when I'm using the internet, it decides to disconnect or give me a limited connectivity messages. Lastly and worst of all, the screen cracked!  Not sure if the dog or one of the kids stepped on it but I opened the screen and it looks cracked with broken pixels.  Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.  Don't buy anything because it's \"CUTE\".  That's really the only reason I did.  I guess I'll buy one of those $400 netbooks!","Date":"November 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Would be great, if it worked....","Author":"Jeffrey A. Thomson","ReviewID":"R823P2TYCEGJ8","Overall":"bad","Content":"Well, would be a great computer - if it worked....  Ordered the cute little red PC from Sony direct....  Would have been nice if they loaded the operating system on to the computer correctly.  It is hard to imagine how a PC can pass Sony quality control if Windows was not loaded.Sony is going to take 10-14 days to replace it...  I have asked for a refund as I do not want to deal with Sony's poor customer service in the future.Think long and hard about buying a Sony PC...  In this day where you can get a computer basically at your local 7-11, customer service matters as much as the quality of the hardware.  In my case, Sony Customer Service let me down.Jeff Thomson","Date":"April 21, 2009"}

I own several netbooks, some of which I have purchased through Amazon.com.That being said, if you wish to make a fashion statement, buys one of these. They look great!  The performance on the other hand is sub par at best.The start up time is painfully slow.The interface for conectabilty is cumbersome, slow, and rigid.Worst of all. . . the text is nearly unreadable. I have great eyesight. But, I need binoculars to read the text on this thing.Conclusion: If you want to impress someone, show them this piece of eye candy. But, don't turn it on.
