I purchased Andriod and iPad, looking for the perfect flexible, easy to use PC replacement.  No luck. Even a Bluetooth keyboard its not enough to replace the PC as a heavy typing/real work tool.So I purchased a Samsung 5 550.  I already used Google Apps extensively, and this was a natural extension.CH Rome's book gave me a fantastic look into the concepts and methods of using ChromeOS, as well as a detailed step-by-step method for using it.  It actually changed how I use computers.  My 'My Documents\" folder is now my Google Drive folder and I have file access from my PC, Chromebook, iPhone, iPad, and any PC I log into.I use the Chromebook as the heavy typing tool now, as its so fast and easy to start and stop, and stay where I was. I use a wireless mouse with it, and it feels so comfortable!  I could not have known all these capabilities were there without the book.  I can honestly say that less than $6 and a few hours of reading changed a huge aspect of my life.  Not many books can boast that claim.","Date":"September 23, 2012"}

{"Title":"Basic 500 MHz iBook","Author":"R. G. Michel \"rgmichel\"","ReviewID":"R1S40LH7VR7LZA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.","Date":"November 25, 2001"}

I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12\" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday!

At least, not at 1,199 bucks.The bottom-of-the-line iBook is exactly what it should be: Extremely portable and extremely friendly. Extremely fast? Not.This is a compromise machine -- the screen is small and the processor is the slowest available on a Mac. At 12.1 inches, the screen is among the smallest you will find on a laptop nowadays, but it is super-sharp. And the fairly pokey processor is still more than adequate for word processing and iTunes and some basic graphics applications, and for surfing the web. Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4.

Also, 128 MB of RAM is downright puny in today's computing world. You'll definitely want to upgrade to at least 256 MB.Now, for the good part. By making those compromises, the iBook is not only cheap, it is light -- under 5 pounds. Check out a similarly equipped laptop from your weekly Bestbuy ad, and you will see behemoths weighing in at 6, 7, 8 or even 9 pounds! And you will rarely find one this thin, and never one this cool.Battery power on the iBook also far outshines its PC competition, helped in part by that small screen and slow processor.This is basically the perfect machine for someone on the go -- including reporters like me -- or for a K-12 student.If these compromises are simply too much for you, Apple has an alternative for you -- the no-compromises, 5.4 pound, 1-inch thick, super-fast Titanium Powerbook G4. It's your choice.You get what you pay for.","Date":"March 30, 2002"}

{"Title":"Basic 500 MHz iBook","Author":"R. G. Michel \"rgmichel\"","ReviewID":"R1S40LH7VR7LZA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the one with a 20 GB hard drive, and I have since put an extra 256 MB memory in it. This machine is wonderful because it is so light, and yet it is powerful enough to run OS X, and just about any software you want to throw at it. It is dynamite on airport networks. I move mine between home and work i.e. between two airport networks, and that is really easy and convenient. The screen is just the right size for a portable, and really easy to read, and clear as crystal. If you want speed, go for the higher CPU speeds and the higher bus speed, but I have been very happy with the 66 MHz bus and 500 MHz processor. It is fine for everyday work. If you really want to move fast, use your desktop. I use a dual processor G4 with two screens when I really need to move fast during the day. However, my ibook is always on, in use for my calendar and for backups, resting by the side of my desktop screens. I would not be without it. At home it is my main machine, where I do all my work stuff. What amazes me is how many applications I can keep open and in use for hours under OS X. No crashes, lots of flexibililty to keep many things going at once. Absolute magic! The really neat thing is when you meet a PC maven, or even a G4 Powerbook, the other machines are so BIG! This ibook is wonderful on the road. I have carried my ibook around in a ordinary bag, not a padded computer bag, for a week at at time, bumping about, with no ill effects, either on the computer or on my shoulder!I add this comment over a year later.  I stand by what I said above, except that the hinge on the screen is giving me trouble now.  The computer needs to warm up for a while before I can put the screen in its fully opened position. Eventually, I am going to have it fixed.","Date":"November 25, 2001"}

I bought it to replace my then 6yo 9500, which died of burned out motherboard. The iBook was supposed to be a temporary fix, until a G5 desktop came out. Now that I have used this model for almost 9 months I think my next Mac will be an iBook. I do graphics, and the 12\" screen is not hard to deal with. The extra cable, from Apple, lets me hook up to a TV, stereo, or projector. The included monitor adapter lets me hook up to a monitor for a dual screen. I hope the next iBook I get will let me have an additional screen, instead of mirroring. The only things I would want for my next model would be the Superdrive, to burn CDs & DVDs, a longer life battery, and a G5 cpu (ha!). Right now, in OS X, I can get about 3 hours of battery, unless I play a game. Illustrator, GoLive, & LiveMotion all work fine in X. Hopefully I will find out how Photoshop 7 works on Monday! I have used several desktop models, including a G4 at work, and the quaint, quiet iBook has out-charmed them all. One other thing: at home I use a full size keyboard & mouse, and external speakers.

{"Title":"It's not very good","Author":"S. Pierson","ReviewID":"R2YBF6AYQGBIW4","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought it thinking that Sony was a good brand, but they clearly have no clue when it comes to making computers.The first problem is the battery life.  At first, it could last 20 minutes of websurfing, but now it doesn't last five minutes of sitting still with nothing going on.  It immediately powers down without shutting down of hibernating.The second problem is the default hard drive configuration.  Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you've almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone.The third problem is the graphics card.  It's integrated with the normal memory and has horrible performance.  While I don't expect to be playing the latest games on this machine, it's not even capable of playing games that are ten years old with a decent speed.The fourth problem that I have is the LCD itself.  It's not very bright, and with any sunlight at all it's unreadable.Other than those, it's a pretty standard machine.  I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.","Date":"March 6, 2004"}

{"Title":"It's ok most of the time","Author":"S. Pierson","ReviewID":"R295WHG4GNUFCW","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention:1)  The battery life is horrible.  When you unplug it, it may tell you that it's going to last two hours, but even new, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes of just websurfing (if you are watching a DVD or anything like that, you'll be lucky to get much more than 5 minutes from the battery.)2)  It gets too hot.  I've found that different programs cause it to heat differently.  I tried running Seti@Home on this laptop, but that caused my lap to almost get burned.  You have to be very careful with that.  Also, the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop have come off because the heat of the CPU melts the glue on the bottom.  This has made a mess of the various tables I've put it on, as well as some pants when I've used it on my lap.3)  The sleep functions don't work right.  Every other laptop I've used has had a function to make the laptop shut down or go to sleep automatically when the battery gets too low.  This laptop doesn't appear to have this.  When it feels like it, it will just shut down with no warning.  This has happened at random times when I don't have it plugged into the power.4)  The drivers stink.  There are various problems related to Windows hotfixes and some of the specific hardware drivers.  I forget which one but there was a hotfix for XP that conflicted with the mousepad driver and caused the laptop to freeze up.  As far as I know, Sony never fixed the driver so I've left the patch off.I doubt I'll ever buy a Sony laptop again, but it's not the worst I've used.  I'll probably buy an IBM Thinkpad next time, because they are the best laptops you can buy.","Date":"October 22, 2003"}

{"Title":"Absolutely spectacular!","Author":"\"corman842\"","ReviewID":"R3VL5GLWV1E9PM","Overall":"good","Content":"First thing I should mention: I bought this laptop at a spectacular sale price. I paid $729 for this machine with 640mb of RAM (maxed out) and an Airport card with it. I highly recommend that you do max it out. I played with the 128mb version of this in Compusa and I noticed it to be significantly slower. When maxed out, this machine will run significantly faster than my 1.67Ghz Windows XP desktop in any task you will throw at it. On top of that, the Mac OS is far superior to anything ever put out by Microsoft. It's stable, easy to use, it just works. I have OS X Panther on this and I highly recommend it. I could never live without Expose, Apples far superior answer to the PC bar at the bottom. For those who are not familiar with it, this new feature in Panther will allow you to push F9 on the keyboard and show every window that is open. It will show exactly what is happening in that window at the moment, meaning that if I were to have a video running on it, the video would play on the tiny window as I look for the window I want. I click the window and it goes back to normal, only with that window on top. VERY USEFUL.Besides that, this machine is very well designed. The ports are on the side, no more reaching behind to plug it in. Its got a thick layer of plastic casing, yet is just over an inch thick. The 12 inch screen is amoung the clearest I've ever seen, and is suprisingly easy to use. The speakers are just okay, but you don't buy a laptop for speakers anyway. The snow colored design is absolutly beautiful, and is a nice plus. The screen is on a solid bar, not one of those flimsy PC hinges. This is the most solidly built, yet lightest, thinnest, most compact laptops I've ever owned or used. I have had several PC laptops before this one, and this is, by far, the best machine I have ever owned.By the way, the battery life on this machine is, to sum it up in one word, unbelievable. I  can get about 4 hours of battery life while watching VIDEOS on this, surfing the web I can get upwards of four and a half or more! The low power consumption of the G3 processor makes this an ultra-portable machine.For those who are considering switching. Don't be discouraged by the OS right away. It is something you will need to get used to, but after a few days you will never know how you ever lived without it. I now go back to my PC and just absolutly despise it every second I use it. I have now gotten used to the Mac and enjoy it more than I ever did with my PC. You know what they say, once you've gone Mac, you don't ever go back.Well, to sum it up, this machine is perfect. I have yet to come across any sort of flaw whatsoever. Mac has thought this thing through, their attention to detail is amazing. Everything down to the little hook that comes out just as you close the lid to lock it shut has been designed perfectly.

{"Title":"Absolutely Wonderful...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R17WPBU4J81UEN","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first ever Apple notebook computer and I must say I am terribly pleased. At first I was worried about not having a G4 processor in it, but after recieving my G3 800 iBook and running osX and a few games I must say, I can barely ever discern a difference between this and my imac G4.I ordered 256mb of ram with my iBook because this speeds it up significantly. You probably wouldnt notice many differences until you try to run more than one application at a time, then you start to feel a little sluggish.This computer is great, I was worried that maybe it was one of the crappy logic board ibooks but nope, the serial number is far newer than the ones that are at risk for bad logic Boards.And finally the look of the ibook is seriously cool. I can't wait to go to borders and study for awhile. While everyone else has the same colored gateway laptops plugged into the wall power that borders provides I can cruise with my trusty awesome looking ibook on battery. Also, the power adapter is small, and the thing about people saying the keyboard feels like plastic I disagree with, it is kinda ... hmm, hard to explain, but definitely a plus in my book. Im used to the hard cruching key boards and this one is much less crunchy.Also, the 12 inch size is simply the best size for a laptop. Anythin bigger and portability almost seems like a hassle rather  than a joy.Awesome computer. Dont forget to pick up that extra 256 mb of ram to get it up to 384mb making it much smoother.. actually, completely smooth... Heaven on earth lol.","Date":"April 9, 2004"}

Our teacher allowed us to use some new Ibooks that our school had just purchased. Everyone was so excited because these computers are so cool looking and everyone thought they were fast. We started our project and quickly realized that these were the slowest computers anyone of us had ever used. We were using wireless internet which may have contributed to the computer's slowness, but still it was pathetic. There were maybe 10 people using these computers and about 2/3 of us abandoned the Ibooks to go use the Imacs that our school got in 1998. It also could have been that (even with nortan anit-virus) these computers are very vulnerable to viruses. I'm not sure about how these computers perform in things other than the internet, but if you are planning to buy one of these Ibooks mainly for use on the internet, I would definitly not recommend this computer.","Date":"November 22, 2003"}

{"Title":"Overall a nice laptop for around $1100","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2Y4WQSYMYCE24","Overall":"good","Content":"... did not really review Model 2681CU1 as shown on this website.  This models comes with Pentium 4 -Mobile 1.8 Ghz, 256MB Ram, 20GB Harddrive, CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive.Like the first reviewer said, the 20GB drive should really be called 16GB drive, and in reality, because IBM reserves about 4GB to store recovery info, leaving you with about 10-11GB of hard disk space you can use, so if you really need a lot of hard disk space, beware that instead of 18.6GB, you'll only be getting about 10GB.Boot up on my machine takes about 1 minute with PC cillin Antivirus running, (booting to Win XP Home) so if you are used to 20 sec bootups, this machine will be slow to you on a bootup.  However, once all of the programs are loaded, the computer performs pretty fast.  Also, please note that the Hardrive is about 4200 RPM, so replacing the Disk for a higher RPM's will shorten the boot up time.IBM does not provide a lot of software, I believe I only had Norton AV 2003, PC Doctor and Adobe (among others).  You can type the Model number in IBM's website and get the exact detailed specs of what exactly comes (and does not come) with this laptop.What I like is that the Norton AV and all other applications do NOT load automatically.  You have to go to START--> Programs --->Norton AV 2003 and it will start installing Norton AV 2003.  My previous laptop had all of the software already preloaded, which made it a little more painful, because you ended up uninstalling a bunch of useless programs you did not need.The laptop's case is relatively sturdy and appears like it can take the ocasional bruising without major impact.Also, the BIOS on this laptops comes configured to MAX BATTERY mode, which means that if you are booting from the battery (i.e the AC adapter is not plugged in) your CPU Speed Step will keep the CPU cycles to 1.2Ghz maximum even if your power options says \"Always ON\".  Setting the power setting to AUTOMATIC (in BIOS) will fix this.BEFORE YOU ADJUST BIOS, call IBM tech support to make minimize your chance for errors.I was impressed with the quality of IBM tech support.  I 'd say that I got a live person within 2 minutes and the tech support was somewhere in the US, as opposed to overseas.Battery life seems to be close to 2.5-3hrs, though I have not had a chance to test it out fully.  When fully charges, the battery indicator says that 3 hours is left.Beware that this laptop does not come with a floppy drive.I think that the reason this Laptop costs $1100 is that there are Pentium M chips that are out, replacing P4M's.Oh, and last thing, I have IBM T23 at work and found that the ultrabay drives used with T23 are compatible with R40's (all except R40e) drives.  Check IBM's website for verification. ...","Date":"October 30, 2003"}
{"Title":"Nothing cheap about this","Author":"scott_from_dallas","ReviewID":"R3AJYA2M4P3TRY","Overall":"good","Content":"Sorry to break the news to the previous reviewer (please -- you really have to use a product more than one day to give a competent review), but there is nothing cheap about this laptop. Perhaps he had it configured with a little less power, but mine works as well as any laptop I've ever used.This is my second laptop, but the first one was a small 486 I bought because the size was cool. Now, THAT one was cheap. IBM has made the best laptops and have the best service. The only question for me was initially, whether I wanted to pay for it, and then, which one do I get. Mine is configured with a 2 gig chip, a 40 gig HD, and 512 Meg of RAM. Please don't skimp on the RAM or you will wonder whether your system is slow.It came complete with Windows XP (which I don't care for) and I had to reconfigure everything so it looks more like Windows 2000, which I have on my other desktops. I use the laptop for surfing on wireless internet connections -- both home and away, writing letters and other documents, doing some financial spreadsheets, and will soon be doing some film editing work. The trackhead (whatever its called) works MUCH better for me than the simple trackpad. But the pad is there, and you don't have to use the eraser shaped head in the middle of the keyboard if you don't want to. I don't remember hitting the head and moving the mouse when I typed the letters \"h\" and \"g\" (or whatever two keys it is between) so if you don't like it, it should never interfere with your work.The screen is great! Big enough to have your desktop arranged like you like and plenty big to watch DVDs. The CD/DVD tray comes out, and feels somewhat flimsy, but you shouldn't have a problem taking care of it. On the left side are the various inputs, including (at least on mine) USB, firewire, and s-video. For you multimedia types who want a PowerBook for creative tasks but need a PC to do real work on, don't worry -- the Thinkpad has what you need. I considered a PowerBook and might have actually bought one (even though I'm firmly grounded in the Windows camp), but the prices were just way too much, and I would need a boatload of additional software for the Mac. While your emotional side might miss a PB (Apple does have a knack for appealing to the emotion), the logical beast in you will realize the TP has what you need.The unit will, like every other high powered laptop, get hot on bottom. Mine doesn't create much of a problem. When I'm using it on my recliner, I put a pillow under it and I am fine. When using it on a table or desk, there is no issue.Battery life on every portable unit is always disappointing. I've had my TP since March and have used it some, but not a great deal (once or twice a week on average, but lately increasing). I'm at a little more than three hours, and there is an indicator that clearly gives you an idea how much time you have left. If you fly cross country or longer than 3 hours and need all that time to work, you will need multiple batteries.Finally, I haven't noticed any pixel loss on my screen. The unit is solid enough to take most anywhere. While I treat all my equipment well and don't dropkick anything, if you are a bit rougher on your stuff than I am, I don't think you will need to worry. But don't take this review for any advice on how the IBM will work if mistreated.","Date":"October 23, 2003"}

{"Title":"FANTASTIC laptop but has some minor quirks","Author":"SWL","ReviewID":"R1JDDRPY4JI17C","Overall":"good","Content":"Greetings all, the other review by Sherrila Levin for this item is inappropriate and overzealous (I'm a die-hard Mac fan).  Make no mistake this is a PHENOMENAL computer yet there are some buts...In a nutshell:PROS:- You're walking around with 17\" gorgeous object of envy that has a stunning display great for games, DVDs, doing PhotoShop/Illustrator work, etc.  The great screen ratio is perfect for design apps with palettes, toolbars and the like.- For a laptop, GREAT sounding speakers- Backlit keyboard: Nifty little feature that is best when you have it plugged in.  Otherwise, works well, but is an added drain on the battery when going mobile.  Though, the AMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR that adjusts screen brightness and backlight is AWESOME when it fades in to let you know it's working.- Usual suspects of big hard drive, fast processor, pretty snazzy 3d card, lots of ports, DVD & CD BURNER and loads of RAM make for a REALLY AGILE portable workhorse.- It's always great owning something where you can see the designers put oodles of love and obsession to detail.- Slot loading drive (has no breakable moving doors)- Does not generate heat like previous G3 models or earlier G4sCONS (Few and almost trivial, but worth noting for the uninitiated):- 6.8 pounds isn't the lightest thing in the world if you're lugging it around on one shoulder- Shell is slightly soft and gives way to some small body damage easily (I accidentally dropped mine on the corner from about 1.5 ft off the ground - now have a nice ding.  Other users/reviewers have also mentioned this issue as well).  Just don't be as klutzy as me and you should be fine.Hope this helps.","Date":"November 17, 2003"}
{"Title":"A joy to use, and road-ready to a T","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1PMOFN76IEBRH","Overall":"good","Content":"This aluminum-shelled gem marries beauty and brawn so well that that owners of lesser laptops will surely have a hard time hiding their envy. It's fast and capacious and, like other Apple products, a joy just to take out of the box and see how Apple has thought about every step of the user experience, from unpacking to setting up the built-in wireless networking (a total breeze, and I'm a klutz at that kind of thing). In that same vein, there's the G4 Powerbook's keyboard that automatically lights up with a soft glow from underneath the keys as the light in your office or your airplane cabin dims. It's a small thing, but indicative of a genuinely respectful, design-centric, user-oriented mindset that no other computer company can match.The display is lovely to behold and s-h-a-r-p, and the wealth of (count 'em) 1.3 million pixels makes it hard to go back to my 15'' flatpanel iMac desktop screen. Watching a DVD on a Powerbook screen this big and this good is about as satisfying as visiting my local cineplex, sans the sticky floors.Like the new G5 desktops, the G4 Powerbooks strike me as quite hi-tech and futuristic. That's not a bad thing, but it's a far cry from the happy candy-colored iBooks of a few years ago. The G4 Powerbooks are also not as \"warm & inviting\" as the current generation of elegant white Powerbooks. The persona of the G4 machines is a bit more stand-offish, stark even, and you either like that or you don't. I think they're plenty gorgeous but, at the risk of sounding sexist, my hunch is that it's a 'guy' computer, and that a lot of women won't take a shine to these machines. But I'll let Apple's marketing department worry about that.Finding Panther (Mac OS 10.3) loaded on this machine was a greater boon than I'd imagined. I've used 10.2 (Jaguar) since it came out in August 2002, but Panther is such a big step forward, it almost qualifies as a whole new operating system -- without the learning curve. You can log out without quitting open applications, for instance, in a matter of literally seconds. The improved Finder -- which appears to be modeled in part on Windows XP, though no Mac user would admit that without the benefit of thumbscrews ;-) -- makes navigating through complex hierarchies of folders and files a snap, and it's easy to customize. Also, Apple has brought back color labeling of files and other items -- an OS9 staple it stupidly discarded when the company launched OSX a few years ago. There are more than 150 other big and small improvement (wait'll you get a load of a feature called Exposé, which displays all your open windows, across applications, at the roll of a mouse!), but this is supposed to be a review about the computer, not its operating system.Well then, the G4 17'' Powerbook is a tactile and esthetic pleasure to use. The fit is tight, the finish beautiful. Everything just works right out of the box without the user having to study manuals or spending time on the phone with tech support. I would gush about this machine (and so far I have!), but there are a few minor points of criticism, too:- Apple does sometimes put good looks over practicality. The shell of this Powerbook has no ridges on it -- it's just this sleek, smooth expanse of aluminum. Very purty, but since this is a large and relatively heavy laptop, you're quite likely to let it slip from your grasp at one point or another. Some kind of grip would have been a good idea. Also, there's a latch at the front of the machine that you push to unlock the screen. The latch is almost perfectly flush with the front of the case (so as not to visually break the sleek line of the shell, I'd wager), and I find that it sometimes takes two or three pushes before the screen pops open.- The material looks like it might scratch easily (but I'm trying not to find that out first-hand). At this price -- 3,000 semolians! -- Apple should have included a soft leather sleeve or something, so that you can toss the thus-protected Powerbook into a shoulder bag or backpack and not worry about it. I ordered a neoprene third-party solution called a Sportfolio (40 bucks) that does the job.- I've been forced to use them for years and I still don't like 'em: trackpads. Ugh. Get a mouse. Kensington makes one that works well with a Powerbook; it has a retractable USB cable that stores inside the device when not in use.- The power cord plugs into the side of the machine. That's a bit unsightly. It should have been in the back, where it essentially doesn't show.- More visual clutter: the sides of the machine. They're outfitted with a bevvy of ports, including a Firewire 800 port and an S-video socket (excellent!) and no cover (not so excellent). I realize doors can easily break off, but maybe a molded rubber strip would have (a) been better-looking, and (b) kept dust, dirt, and lint out.- Apple should take a cue from the automobile industry and its included standard 3 year/50,000-miles warranties. The Powerbook has a one-year warranty and only 90 days of phone support. To extend coverage to three full years, you're supposed to purchase a protection plan for -- gulp -- 350 bucks. I guess I'll do it, but I have the uncomfortable feeling I'll be paying for a few years' supply of Steve Jobs's black turtlenecks. I'm OK with him playing hardball with Disney, he just should let up on his own loyal customers a bit. ;-)I've had the G4 17'' Powerbook for a week and intend to really put it through its paces in weeks and months to come. So far, the verdict is very positive. The first Apple Powerbooks, in 1992, also cost multiple thousands of dollars, just like this one. For the same money (less if you count inflation), you can now buy a super-good-looking supercomputer that is a kick-ass music player, an excellent movie-playback machine, a top-notch number cruncher, a high-powered portable recording studio, a serious photo- and video-editing tool, and on and on... I shrugged when I heard about Apple's plans, three or four years ago, to turn their computers into \"hubs for the digital lifestyle.\" But the company did just that, and no portable computer today is a more capable, pleasure-to-work-with digital hub than this gorgeous 17'' G4 Powerbook.Addendum: A few weeks after I wrote this review, I'm on a plane, with the Powerbook in its neoprene sleeve tucked safely in the overhead luggage compartment. Well, maybe not SO safely after all. After touchdown, people start grabbing their bags, anxious to get out -- and some idiot yanks her own luggage out so hard and carelessly that my computer goes flying. It drops in a graceless arc, like a limply flung brick, and lands with a thud that churns my stomach. I actually gasp. This is more abuse than any consumer laptop can handle. After all, it's a fall from almost seven feet high; surely the case is cracked, or the screen broken, or the hard drive knocked out of whack and my data lost -- or all of the above.  Absurdly enough, though, I'm wrong. I zip open the sleeve, fingers trembling, but all is as it should be. The aluminum case is un-dented and as tight as ever; the screen unblemished; the hard drive unperturbed. Now, I wouldn't care to duplicate this little involuntary experiment. Clearly I got lucky. But it's also proof that Apple builds its Powerbooks with real structural integrity -- equipped to deal with the rigors of the road, and with the abuse inflicted on it by hapless users and clumsy strangers alike.","Date":"February 1, 2004"}

This is not the machine you prop up on your legs to read Google News in bed. Hopefully you have something better to do with your US$3K-$4K anyway.I'm a professional media designer and image maker, and I replaced my old dual-processor Macintosh with the 17.1\" 1.33 GHz Powerbook. This is a machine to tote onto a job site or to a presentation and produce great work...perfect for freelancers and those who might not work at their home base all the time.Two great things I've not seen other reviewers mention are the audio hardware quality and dual-monitor support; these can't be under-rated. My Dell PC's audio line out is noisy and full of hiss, while the Powerbook's line out is so quiet that many musicians simply plug it into a club's audio system and it sounds great. Dual-monitor support is second to none. After chafing a bit at the widescreen nature of the screen (i.e., only 900 pixels tall), I instantly shut my mouth when I plugged in another monitor and it immediately started running at 1600 x 1200.While there are some compromises one must make in going mobile, this machine does not disappoint. Rear legs for improved elevation, easy expandability, even a real tray for the DVD-RW drive ... all these things have been removed to make the machine as streamlined as possible. But I happily accept all these compromises to use a Macintosh that is powerful, relatively lightweight, portable...and sexy as all get-out.

{"Title":"Great computer, few flaws","Author":"Robert Graves","ReviewID":"R32N71H5V7YZ9X","Overall":"good","Content":"Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.","Date":"February 18, 2004"}
{"Title":"Best computer I've ever owned","Author":"Zach Everson \"Writer. Editor. Consultant.\"","ReviewID":"R2BQVGJ24DBUVS","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a 12-inch Powerbook after I gave my old Sony Vaio notebook the Pete Townshend treatment - I put my fist through it. (Yes, it looks like a stained glass window.) I hadn't used a Mac in years, but I decided I'd had it with Microsoft and Windows. All it took was one weekend and a good book - \"Mac OS X: The Missing Manual,\" by David Pogue -however, and I mastered the machine.(Other than the size of the screen, the 17-inch model is the same as the 12-inch one.)SOFTWAREThe computer comes with some great software. iTunes is the best media player on the market. I have almost 5,000 songs stored on mine. With the search function and browser display, it is easy to find a particular song. iTunes also keeps track of the number of times you've listened to a song and it allows you to rate your songs. It's easy to create a playlist. Also, burning one of those playlists onto a CD can be done with one click.Safari is a great web browser. It has a Google search box built into the toolbar, prevents pop-up ads (I've never had one), has tabbed browsing (preventing a cluttered desktop), and allows for bookmarks to be added with one click.iChat allows Mac users to customize their AIM and Rendezvous chat sessions in ways that the normal applications don't allow, such as adding pictures from iPhoto to their profile.I haven't mastered iPhoto yet, but it is downloading pictures from a digital camera is as easy as plugging it into the USB port and clicking a button.Also, Macs are less likely to get a virus or be overtaken by spyware.The iCal and Address Book look good, but if you are going to sync a PDA with your Mac, you are better off using Palm Desktop software. Hopefully the functionality of those programs will be improved in the future though.Finally, most of the programs work with each other. For example, if someone on my iChat buddy list is online, a green dot will appear next to a message from him or her in my Mail inbox.I also use Microsoft Office, Quicken, Dreamweaver MX, and Palm Desktop - they all work well on the Mac. Office shares files perfectly with PCs.HARDWARESpend the money and get the superdrive (CD-RW/DVD-R). DVDs have more memory than CDs and blank DVD-Rs are becoming more affordable. If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I'd recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive. Burning a DVD requires a lot of memory and can take a while - this way you can use other applications while burning a DVD (on my old PC, if I was burning a CD, I couldn't use anything else). The hard drive space is really cheap. Plus, if you load your CDs on your computer, they can eat up a lot of memory, even as MP3s (my 5,000 songs take up about 25 GB).Also, there is a lot to be said for getting the Airport Exteme card (although you can buy a third-party base station for less). I am able to browse the Internet in any room of my house - well worth the extra $100 or so.I have the 12-inch monitor, but that was because Apple hadn't released the 15-inch in the new style when I made my purchase. The 12-inch is fine - it's much clearer than my old PC notebook - but if I had the opportunity, I'd probably go with the bigger monitor.DRAWBACKS-While most software is available for Mac OS X, there are some programs that aren't (Google toolbar, Yahoo! toolbar, Kazaa, AvantGo) or minor problems in software that is available (Quicken can't access accounts on Ameritrade via Macs)-The PowerBook doesn't have a fan, which is great for the battery, but can cause it to get a bit hot underneath where the user rests his left hand.Regardless of those drawbacks, however, buying a Mac was an easy decision. If you have any questions about it, click on my profile and send me a e-mail.UPDATE: After 14 months, the hard drive started making noise and system performance got slow and I couldn't run as many programs as I used to. I called Apple and had to spend $300 for them to put in a new hard drive and some other hardware. They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I've spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications. No idea why the hard drive went. Hence I dropped the rating from five stars to four.","Date":"April 13, 2004"}

It's that powerful and versatile, and if you're a windows user, the design of the OS X operating system that it runs will enhance your experience and workflow in ways you can't even imagine.  The aluminum frame beats the old titanium design easily.  Solid, resistant to scratches, better heat dissipation.  Close the lid, then slam it around, drop it, prop it against the wall and kick it over.  You'll break your foot before you break the laptop.  The display is large enough, and the text rendering is sharp enough, that you'll forget entirely about workspace issues.  A piece of advice: Get the new logitech optical USB mouse with the little app-switcher button on it, and assign that extra button to the Expose feature of OS X 10.3.  Use it whenever you're working at a tabletop or desk.  Freaking brilliant.  This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be.","Date":"November 13, 2003"}

{"Title":"Small, sexy and built like a tank. 4½ Stars","Author":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","ReviewID":"R4PXGJH33IRK0","Overall":"good","Content":"This new laptop replaces a Toshiba A15-S127 that we bought 3 months ago and one that died 4 weeks later when the LCD screen cracked. This one still confuses my wife and me given that the thing spent most of its time in its carry case and it bore absolutely no external damage on the laptop's shell. To add insult to injury the store we bought it from wanted to charge us literally 2/3rds the cost of the thing to repair it, manufacturer's warranty be dammed, I guess. Suffice it to say that we won't be buying Toshiba products again nor shopping at this store (who's name, by the way, rhymes with Stomp Youse Say), ever again. I would have reviewed the S127, but what's the point? We hardly had it long enough to get to know it.When Sony began producing computers, I was less than impressed. Yet another big name producing very shiny products that look great while using second rate parts that deliver underwhelming performance. That was several years ago and while I still don't care for big name brand PCs, they are still good machines. Even though I build my PCs from parts I choose, I can't build a lap top, and after the Toshiba debacle, anything would have been an improvement. Truth to tell, I didn't really like the Toshiba from the start, but my wife wanted something cheap to take to work and use it to learn Spanish, practice her mathematics and watch the occasional movie, and the Toshiba did a fair job at all of those things. The Sony PCG-505DX is a vast improvement in every category, though it was twice the price.The 505 features a 1.5 Ghz Pentium 4 Centrino processor- possibly the most important consideration when buying a laptop these days. The CPU scales its speed and processing ability to conserve power and extend the usability of the lap top. With the full charge the 505 will run for nearly 5 hours when doing things like word processing. Obviously, the more things you do, the shorter the battery life will be. The Vaio also sports a whopping 512 mb of RAM, an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 with 16 mb of its own RAM, (a lot of laptops video RAM is actually shared with system RAM and performance takes a real hit), a 400 Mhz FSB, an 11 mb IEEE 802.11b `Wi-fi' wireless network adapter, 1 PC-MCIA slot, 2 USB + 1 IEEE 1394 FireWire ports, CD-RW & DVD player combo drive, Network and modem ports, VGA port, and a Sony memory stick slot. All of this is packed into a very small and very attractive box,. The casing also has a lot of polished aluminum, which will no doubt enhance the durability and life of the computer.Though the S127 was fully 600 Mhz faster, the 505 out performs it every category- it boots faster, loads programs faster, and came with much better software pre-installed. I actually plan to keep all of Sony's own music and video programs, which is odd as I usually spend the first day or so with any laptop I have owned blowing out all the junk and promotional software that comes with them. About the only things I removed was AOL and that really terrible office package known as Microsoft Works. Everything else will stay. Sony also wisely partitioned the 60 Gb hard drive to make mirroring the drive much easier. (What they didn't include was a system restore CD or DVD and instead require you to make your own. If you want to do this, make sure your have a stack of CD-Rs handy, because it will take 9 of them).The 505 is actually pretty much the same size as my old 486 Compaq Aero, which itself was a dynamite little machine. I love the Vaio's design and feel- it's sturdy, incredibly well made and given the luck we have had with our other Sony products, I suspect this little beauty will be around for a long time. About the only real complaints I have about it is the speakers sound terrible, but then again, this is a laptop and a general gripe about laptop keyboards in general- I just can't get comfortable with any of them. This is the best laptop I have ever owned in both performance and build quality. The screen image quality is great, the keys and controls intuitive, I only wish we had bought this first instead of the Toshiba.","Date":"December 4, 2003"}

Looks are certainly deceiving.  Two months later, I left the notebook idle for 5 minutes while I attended to something else, and when I returned and touched the touchpad to activate it, the whole thing shut down and wouldn't start up again.  Sony Support told me to take out the battery, hold down the power button, etc., but nothing worked so it was sent in for repair and I received it 4 working days later.  A month and a half later, in mid-March, I touched the touchpad to move the mouse and the notebook died again!!  It was completely unresponsive to any attempts to revive it.  I am incredulous at the quality of this product.  Sony should really get its act together.  If there's one thing I have learned from using this product, it is to constantly backup my files.  When the notebook was working, it worked beautifully, but it's intolerable to have to send it in for repair every couple of weeks.  I would strongly urge prospective buyers to consider other laptops, e.g. the IBM X40.","Date":"March 28, 2004"}

Though many people think 12.1\" screen is smaller, I do not think so, it gives you an 1024x768 resolution which is very good, unless you are expecting your laptop to be a TV replacement to watch movies. I am a student and use my laptop for heavy software development and I never faced any problem with the CPU performance. Till now my experience with this new centrino processor is awesome. As for the battery life issues, it cant be better than this. Though compared to the other centrino machines this machine is bit expensive, but I pay for the style and brand and the quality of the product. Its been 3 weeks since I bought this notebook, and I never repented for paying the extra buck..AS for the other side,You have to make your own recovery CD's, which is very important step before you do anything with the laptop.. And I could not upgrade to windows XP professional, it gave me some virtual memory low message and kept on restarting after the installation was done, So I had to do complete installation of XP Pro. If the XP pro upgrade is not successful for you also, do not worry. You can put the recovery CD 1 and get all the software installed back on the clean XP professional. So there is a way around to keep the software which came with the machine and have XP pro.. And I am little disappointed SONY did not provide us with a third party CD writer software, we are forced to use the inbuilt XP writer, which is slow compared to NERO cd burner software or Roxio easy cd creator.. Overall you will get the value for your money..And I do not understand why Amazon display's different specification on this website than what we see on sony. My laptop has an L2 cache of 1MB, but amazon displays here it as 512 KB which is very confusing. I didnt buy my notebook on Amazon becoz of that confusion..","Date":"December 29, 2003"}
{"Title":"HORRIBLE SUPPORT FROM SONY","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3L26OMAOOYIKI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this laptop at the end of November 2003.  I liked the laptop - lightweight, good battery life (for what I need), compatiable for wireless internet - quick - keyboard takes a little getting used to, but not bad once you get started.  I was very happy with my purchase.At the beginning of January I accidently picked up this laptop by the screen.  Apparently this caused a VERY LARGE THUMB PRINT ON THE LCD SCREEN.  So words of advice, never EVER touch the screen.In the middle of January I set my laptop down.  When I came back it would no longer go on.  I called Sony help on a call that lasted 3 hours.  WE TRIED NUMEROUS THINGS TO GET THE COMPUTER TO WORK AGAIN WITH NO AVAIL.  I WAS TRANSFERRED TO ABOUT 5 PEOPLE DURING THIS CALL.  FINALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE WAS THE SHIP THE COMPUTER TO SONY FOR REPAIR IN CALIFORNIA.  I LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS.  So off the computer went to California.  Since the computer was ONLY 2 MONTHS old they said whatever was wrong would be covered under warranty.WELL HERE IS WHERE THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS........Remember the THUMB PRINT I told you about from touching the LCD screen.  They were trying to charge me $795.00 to replace the LCD screen and would not do any repairs until I agreed to pay the $795.00 for the replacement of the LCD screen.  Not that I particullary like having a thumb print on my LCD screen, I like even less having to pay $795.00 after just purchasing the computer in November for $1,799.00.  Touching the LCD screen SHOULD NOT CAUSE SUCH A THING.  I had a DELL laptop for 4 years and touched it on many occasions and NEVER EVER had a problem.  Not once did the DELL stop working for no reason or break because I touched the LCD screen.After 2 weeks of fighting with SONY........probably a GOOD 15 hours total on the phone, it was finally decided that they would NOT FIX THE LCD SCREEN, but they would get the computer to start working again.  It has yet to be explained to me WHY the COMPUTER STOPPED WORKING IN THE 1st place.That was covered under warranty and my computer is now back 2 weeks later up and running.  I can put up with a thumb print I guess.  But words of advice NEVER EVER TOUCH YOUR LCD SCREEN.  IT IS VERY SENSATIVE.  AND SONY CUSTOMER SUPPORT HAS TO BE THE WORST I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE.  I probably spoke with about 20 people during this time and only one girl by the name of WENDY provided me any CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Although I do like this computer, I would not recommend it.  A computer should not stop working for no reason after 2 months and an LCD Screen should not leave an imprint after touching it.  The customer support is terrible.  If I had it to do all over again I would go back to a DELL which caused me no problems in the 4 years I had it.  It was just time to upgrade to a largeer, quicker, newer version.  The weight of this computer and style is what led me to this.  Really, its not worth it compared to the aggreviation that I have experienced and the lack of customer support.","Date":"February 14, 2004"}
{"Title":"Small, light and just right!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RZV68XVOT7ETM","Overall":"good","Content":"There are some really great things about this laptop. First, the weight (or lack of it). It is light and easy to carry in a bag, which will be a relief if you are replacing a nearly 10 pound laptop like me. The old dinosaur was doing well if it got 70 minutes from a battery. The V505DX gets almost 4 HOURS for basic word processing and surfing (closer to 2 and change if you're watching a DVD).I had read the complaints and had to buy my unit sight unseen, but I am very happy. I had heard bad things about the keyboard. They are, for the most part, not true. Yes, it is a smaller keyboard. Yes, the right shift key is small, but you can get used to it by using it for a couple of hours. The screen looks good and is a 12 incher, but you get the savings in weight.You will find when you get this laptop that it comes with no discs for the OS or bundled software. This is because Sony has partitioned to the drive so that the application software is in one place if it needs to be reloaded. In theory, all your data should be on the second partition (D drive), so if anything ever happens, you can restore your machine to functionality while saving your data. I moaned about this at first, but I know see the advantages of it. What it really means is that you are not going to be able to do a clean install of XP Pro and you are not going to be able to take the partition off the drive without risking losing the ability to restore your laptop should something go wrong.You do have to create your own recovery discs (9 of them!) or order a DVD recovery disc from Sony for about 15 bucks. If you are like me and like to format your laptop as soon as you get it, you will need to know that you aren't going to be able to do this (at least easily) with this one.I do wish the warranty was longer than a year, but every other laptop I have looked at seems to have the same.Love this baby!","Date":"February 4, 2004"}

So far, I'm glad I did.  The 505dv is packed with memory (comes with 512, can be upgraded to 2 gigs) and a very fast processor for a computer this small (1.4 mhz pentium M).  As someone else has noted, the video card has its own memory.  The 505Dx really seems to be targeted at people who want to do digital video or media, hence the extremely large hard drive, relatively souped-up video card, and relatively large amount of memory capacity.  It also comes with a large amount of media software preinstalled.  Oddly, this model does not seem to have a DVD-writable drive available as an option.The laptop itself is just under five pounds, and the casing seems strong and durable.  It offers two USB 2.0 ports, which, trust me, you will appreciate when using peripheral devices.  Other perks include built-in wireless networking and a memory stick slot.Now the downside-the laptop does not have a very large range of available features-you can choose XP pro or home, 40-80GB hard drive, and more memory, but not much else is optional.  This is common failing of laptops in general.  As with most small laptops, the optical drive is built-in and can't be swapped out.  The keyboard and mouse are hard to use and the mousepad in particular is not very sensitive (another common failing of laptops in general).  The sound from the speakers is crappy, but laptop speakers always sound crappy.  Get some external speakers or headphones.Also, note that sony skimps on its warranties-mine came with only a one-year limited warranty for parts and service and 90-day free technical support.  Sony really needs to take a lesson from Dell and offer greater warranty coverage, especially for laptops, which tend to be more fragile and abused.In all, I think this computer is a great value for the money, particularly if you want something small and powerful with which to do music downloading and sharing.","Date":"February 2, 2004"}

For example, if someone on my iChat buddy list is online, a green dot will appear next to a message from him or her in my Mail inbox.I also use Microsoft Office, Quicken, Dreamweaver MX, and Palm Desktop - they all work well on the Mac. Office shares files perfectly with PCs.HARDWARESpend the money and get the superdrive (CD-RW/DVD-R). DVDs have more memory than CDs and blank DVD-Rs are becoming more affordable. If you are into collecting videos of concerts, a DVD-R is a must.I'd recommend upgrading to at least 768 MB of memory and the 80 GB hard drive. Burning a DVD requires a lot of memory and can take a while - this way you can use other applications while burning a DVD (on my old PC, if I was burning a CD, I couldn't use anything else). The hard drive space is really cheap. Plus, if you load your CDs on your computer, they can eat up a lot of memory, even as MP3s (my 5,000 songs take up about 25 GB).Also, there is a lot to be said for getting the Airport Exteme card (although you can buy a third-party base station for less). I am able to browse the Internet in any room of my house - well worth the extra $100 or so.I have the 12-inch monitor, but that was because Apple hadn't released the 15-inch in the new style when I made my purchase. The 12-inch is fine - it's much clearer than my old PC notebook - but if I had the opportunity, I'd probably go with the bigger monitor.DRAWBACKS-While most software is available for Mac OS X, there are some programs that aren't (Google toolbar, Yahoo! toolbar, Kazaa, AvantGo) or minor problems in software that is available (Quicken can't access accounts on Ameritrade via Macs)-The PowerBook doesn't have a fan, which is great for the battery, but can cause it to get a bit hot underneath where the user rests his left hand.Regardless of those drawbacks, however, buying a Mac was an easy decision. If you have any questions about it, click on my profile and send me a e-mail.UPDATE: After 14 months, the hard drive started making noise and system performance got slow and I couldn't run as many programs as I used to. I called Apple and had to spend $300 for them to put in a new hard drive and some other hardware. They were unable to transfer my data to my new hard drive, so I've spent the past four days reloading all of my software and applications. No idea why the hard drive went. Hence I dropped the rating from five stars to four.","Date":"December 15, 2003"}

What a great machine this is. Much better than the comparable IBook...twice the processor cache for starters...and none of the problems that have plagued the 1Gz iBook.  Weighs just 4.6 pounds and is very portable...aluminium case is very scratch resistant.  I get GREAT range with the add-on Airport Extreme card going to a LinkSys 11g access point (there's an antenna in the lid of the unit).  I'm very happy with the battery life, the operating system, and the apps I use on this machine (Office X mostly).  About a month after getting and using this machine I got a G5 for my desktop and I'm quite happy.  If you're looking for a gaming rig, forget Apple but if you're looking for a business-oriented machine that fits in very smoothly with a PC-based office, this is the ticket. Networks much easier than a Windows machine!","Date":"March 3, 2004"}

The build quality is excellent and the aluminum casing exudes class. Compared to the first 12-inch PowerBook, it runs cooler and is quite a bit snappier. Plus it supports DVI out and USB 2.That said, its battery life and Airport range are not quite as good as an iBook's. So unless you're going to do a lot of serious video/graphics work, you may want to consider one of the new G4 iBooks -- they're great machines for the price.Really, you can't go wrong either way, depending on your needs.","Date":"November 2, 2003"}

I had a 15\" TI and experienced most of the normal complaints one reads about in the various message boards (heat, bad paint). Given the vast differences between M$ products and the way the Apple performed, my sanity said go for it!To sum up. The aluminum case, the size, the reliability make it worth it. It's a head turner. I get lots of comments in Starbucks when I check e-mails and do some work. My only advice would be to invest in a good case. The latch is flimsy and probably will fail if you carry the Pbook around naked a lot. The Airport Extreme card is a worthwhile accessory, too. So many places have 802.11 access these days. There are also after market car and airline chargers available which will effectively allow you to work from the time you leave your office and fly to a far off destination. Battery life is good so far. From talking to other owners and personal experience, I recommend going with the manual recomendations. I consistently get between two and three hours depending on what I am doing. I would expect two years of usage from this notebook. By that time, Jobs and Company will have something faster and better that you won't be able to live without.","Date":"January 11, 2004"}

I bought the 12\" Powerbook G4 1Ghz, and have been blown away by it. It has a good metallic design and its size is very easy to carry around, this is the major disadvantage of larger bulkier notebooks. I have had mine upgraded to 1.25 GB Ram, and the performance of applications like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop is great. You can even play games like Halo on it pretty well, if that is your thing. You can have up to 80GB of HD, and my advice is to buy the largest you can afford. I also have an Airport (802.11g) card installed, and it allows wireless connectivity with a pretty good range. In addition, Bluetooth built-in allowed me to use a very nice wireless mouse with it.  The Keyboard is of good quality, an important feature if you have to write long documents in Word! The LCD screen is of good quality too.

{"Title":"Great machine, few flaws","Author":"Robert Graves","ReviewID":"R3KQMKBQPZ1W5F","Overall":"good","Content":"Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it.The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance.I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably).The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had).All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.","Date":"February 18, 2004"}

A notebook or laptop it is not; its big and heavy by todays standards but the performance is fantastic!The Gateway desktop died (will never buy from them again) and couldn't be brought back to life so I decided to pick up a \"notebook\".  The FRV37 is blazing fast, the screen is large, bright and clear & its got plenty of HD space (if you need more consider getting an external USB hard drive).  With a CD and a DVD burner you really don't need a desktop machine anymore.  It comes with a nice software bundle.  Its got firewire built in and is great for capturing video from digital video cameras.  If you go on vacation, take this computer, a Sony or Canon Digitial video cam and an Olympus digital camera and everyone on the trip can go home with CDs or DVDs of the trip.Buy this machine if you want to replace your desktop, you don't need long bettery life (it gets about 2 hours max), and you want something portable but not light weight.  The only thing missing is built in wireless but for about $50.00 you can get a wireless card that will do the trick.

The keyboard and display are both very nice. The sound is not great but it was better than two Toshiba machines I was looking at. It has USB 2.0 and Firewire. It also has an ATI Radeon chip with 64mb of shared RAM. I was able to make restore disks using two DVD-R and one CD-R with no trouble and free up the restore partition on the hard drive. I benchmarked my machine using SiSoft Sandra 2003 and came up with performance expected of a 2.8 Ghz Pentium 4. I should point out that I am technically experienced. I had my own business repairing and upgrading computers. Maybe the process of creating the restore disks is more challenging for others.

Apple has solved this problem, why can't sony?B) heavy.  and the ac adapter is HUGE, about the size of a psp/1st gen. gameboy.  Will fit in backpack, but it will weigh you down.  It's fine to carry - so long as its the only thing you're carrying.C) hot.  i highly recommend a centrino processor.  p4s are just too hot for a laptop.

It is no longer lacking in the processor department and thus is a very \"well-rounded\" laptop.As for the machine itself, it's great. The entire laptop is white, crisp white (a mixed blessing...it's elegant, but very, very hard not to dirty it), and the overall design is great. Everything is ergonomical and compact: the little latch to close the iBook stays hidden on the top, but then magically appears as you close it. (Gotta love Apple's design team for those little things!) The keyboard, unlike other models, isn't \"spongy.\"In fact, it is rather sturdy for a laptop keyboard. It is stationed to a strong metal backboard and if you take the keyboard and backboard off, you will see a slot for an Airport Extreme card (card that enables wireless internet). No more PC \"NIT\" cards protruding from the sides, everything is on the inside. The top of the computer has a translucent Apple logo that glows when you are computing in the dark. The trackpad is large and precise, and the button (Windows users, beware: no \"Left-clicking\" in the Mac world, only \"Command clicking\"!) is large and responsive.Battery life is excellent, I get an average of 5 hours with normal use. The charger has a light indicating the level of charge so you know when the 'book is charged (green for charged, amber for charging) without turning it on or waking it from its \"Sleep\" mode. Panther, the latest version of Mac OS X (10.3), is stunning, powerful, and reliable in its own right (go ahead and check out those reviews or Jaguar's reviews, the previous OS X version.) I don't want to go into the benefits of its UNIX core, just trust me that it is stable. The \"iLife\" set of software is one that really revolutionized the Apple world, after OS X, software-wise. It's all here: iTunes (store, burn, and buy music in one easy-to-use program), iPhoto (organize, burn, share, print, edit, email, and more with a plug-and-play friendly piece of software), iMovie (for editing, storing, and organizing your DV movies), but no iDVD...no DVD burner (but you can buy an external one.) Some other good programs that supplement your iLife are Mail, Appleworks, iChat, iCal, etc. It comes with World Book 2003, Quicken, and a few others.It's fast. CD's burn with one click. My iPod (a great addition to this for music lovers) loads with one slide of a Firewire cable (literally.) Safari has built-in pop-up control (never has a single pop-up existed here.) Games (only the Sims so far) load and play flawlessly. DVD watching is pristine. USB 2.0 and Firewire (a BIG plus for external hard drives) work at top speed. No bugs, no crashes, no viruses. This machine was engineered to have the software and hardware be integrated. Have a problem? You won't be told to call a different company. You will always have one number to call, and they can't transfer you (since they make the hardware and software)What more is there to say? I love my iBook! It's light, user friendly, and works like a dream. Quick! Go order one. You'll be in for a treat.","Date":"January 9, 2004"}

{"Title":"Daziling Laptop","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1JBTMD8D4K7ID","Overall":"good","Content":"The iBook G4 is a great laptop! It runs like a charm. And is extreamly fast compared to the older iBooks. I can have several applications open and it works great! Such as I can have Safari, AIM, iTunes, and more open and play a game and it runs perfectly. In fact it would seem it is just as fast as some of the iMacs. It has very clear sound for iTunes or games or anything. Speaking of games: Because it has a very strong processor (G4 933 MHz) games run like heaven on it. Currebntly I have Call of Duty on it, a rather strong game, and it delvers the perfect experiance Mac gamers want. The iBook G4 aslo comes with for no charge at all Tony Hawk's Proskater 4 and Deimos Rising. Back to applications: Th iBook G4 has great applicatons such as iTunes, Safari, Internet Explorer, iChat, AppleWorks 6, iCal, iPhoto, iMovie,and more!  This computer also has very long battery life. Around 4 or 5 hours! As for design, wonderful. It has a great screen, and great keyboard (in fact one of the best laptop keyboards I have used). And I like it's color. It's just a simple good looking white. There you have it, the great and almighty iBook G4. Trust me, worth it's money.","Date":"June 20, 2004"}
{"Title":"True Love At Last","Author":"Carolina Kipnis","ReviewID":"R39451D3N90HDB","Overall":"good","Content":"This little beauty came into my life around Christmas, and she and I have been inseparable since then.  I ordered it directly from the Apple Store Online, and I had it maxed out on RAM, and had the optional 60G hard drive installed.  I love the processor speed, immense capability, and versatility.  The screen size makes it a suitable replacement for a desktop computer.I do everything on this computer: word-processing, spreadsheets, music transcription, photo editing, Internet communications, audio editing, and managing my music collection.  I have Office X, Sibelius, and  iLife 2004. I run iTunes in the background, write a report integrating Excel and Word, plus can have all my pictures handy on iPhoto.  I can have five or six applications running at the same time (not including iChat and MSN Messenger, which are ALWAYS running), and the processor doesn't even hiccup.  I use an iPod 40G as an external hard drive (not to mention all dem kewl tunes!), and have a Canon PowerShot A80 digital camera, and an iMic audio converter.  Add to that an AirPort driven wireless network and a laser printer, and you have an ultra-powerful home office for any kind of occupation, from music composition, culinary research, to communications-based businesses.Although larger and heavier than the 12\" iBook, I believe the 14\" screen is definitely worth the extra weight and price.  If you get it, the wireless card (AirPort Extreme) is a must.  The optional built-in Bluetooth module is nice, especially if you have a compatible PDA or cell phone.I didn't realize I would love owning a laptop.  Until I met this one.","Date":"February 23, 2004"}
{"Title":"14.1\" iBook by Apple","Author":"Brian","ReviewID":"RY5MB4WJMJXB2","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, let me say that I paid the 1500 dollars in September, before they changed all the iBooks to G4s and the USB ports to 2.0 .  Why is this important?  Well, a few reasons.  Final Cut Pro only works on G4s.  I paid 699 dollars for the upgrade that my computer could certainly handle, however the software was designed to look for a G4 or G5 in order for installing.  So, as that wouldn't have been too aggrivating until I tried to take it back to CompUSA which I soon found out has a zip-O-la return policy, I got a bit peeved at both CompUSA and Apple Software design.  Well, within two months of my purchase the 'new' G4 iBooks were on the net to buy, and I had my answer on Apples ideas for makeing a touch more money by getting me to buy a new laptop, if I want to run something like.. oh Final Cut Pro, or some animation software on the market.However, the reason I put five stars wasn't Apple's beautiful software marketing and design, or CompUSAs ability to move a person to consider programming a video game thats objective is strangling CompUSA employees.The real reason is that for laptops, and for this price, it is a quality laptop.  You see, I can't justify to myself paying over 1500 of a base price for a tool that I'm going to be using out of my home.  At any moment it could be stolen and I am much more at peace with a loss of 1500 dollars for a top of the line iBook which can be much more readily replaced than 3000 dollars for a top of the line PowerBook.My laptop has survived a 2 ft plus drop while open from a bed to a not so plush carpeted floor.  There wasn't too much destruction done other than some of the lineing on the left edge of the screen and the battery doesn't fit as smoothly as before.  Everything still works, including all the ports I use, like the USB, firewire, 56K Modem, and the Adapter port.  It works fine on battery and plugged in, so I really didn't lose any functionality.The laptop operating system doesn't break down, although it does freeze every once in a while.  The software that it comes with is very useful, and handy, and not as annoying as say, windows media player..  The text editing software that it comes with is ahhhhh!!!ggrrr.. when you try to program html initially.. fortunately, after going to the preferences you can fix this loading html pages as a web browser does initial setting.  iTunes is fun, and useful, and the only drawback is that it doesn't read the song encoding on CDs that Windows Media Player does.  So you have to either manually type the name of the song in by hand, or buy your songs off the internet at a buck a piece.  The iPhoto works fine and allows for some adjustment, but if you're into adjusting your photos, use nothing less than Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  Photoshop might well be a waste of 600 plus dollars if you get good at Elements 2.0 .  In fact.. I'd dare say Adobe Illustrator and Elements 2.0 could be a grand combo.  Safari is a good browser with annoyances with interpreting java on the web.  No joke, web browsers that understand Java well on the web on macs are rare as leopard seals.  There is only two of them.  One is the Microsoft Internet Explorer(who stopped making new IEs for mac because Safari does everything it does) and the other is Safari.  Every other web browser.. say.. mozilla??  like Netscape 7.01, Firebird .7 and Mozilla and Camino seem to all be carbonized.  And the problem?  Well, for some reason, carbonizing does not like Java or something.  No Java, no chatting, or java online gaming.  So the only chatting you can do say on Yahoo is on Safari and IE.  No problem, they are both free.  And Safari is included with all the new macs.  But for your daily web browsing, you might want to download Firebird .7 .  After you get the tab browsing down and the various keyboard commands, you will find its just the best daily browser out there.  It runs secure bank transactions in xml fine and quickly.  As a bonus AppleWorks comes with every new iBook, so you definitely have a decent word processor.  But don't be fooled with the Microsoft Office that seems to be included, Microsoft wouldn't forgoe a profit that easily.  The Microsoft Office on the computer is a 30 day trial.  Office X is 500 dollars.  Not too much for full licensing for a single user.  And well worth it if you're in college or otherwise use it frequently.  Look at QuarkXPress for some serious pricing.. oww.  The clock is nifty and calendar is useful, and the internet options are easily read in the upper menu bar.  And for entertainment, you can talk to the computer and it will do what you say.. if you can speak it well enough for the computer.. you know.. the standard speech recognition flaw.  The fun thing about all this is that you talk to the chess game and play an entire chess game by speaking alone.  It's actually pretty nifty.There is enough computer software out there for the mac, especially if you want to get work done and you work with video or images.  The Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2 don't save files quite the same way which can be a touch annoying if you are using old macs at school still.  You have to specify the exact program to open this or that file between the two operating systems.  This is easy enough.. as long as its only a file or two, come ten or so, and it gets a bit annoying.  On the good end, it is more compatable with pcs now.  There is a decent software translation of Windows XP for purchase for ultimate compatability.  Wasn't too bad, but as always.. anything Microsoft runs as slow as a slug.  Try a G5 if you want to run the Windows XP translation a lot.  If Windows XP freezes, it doesn't freeze OS X, and thats kinda nice.  Adobe has most of there popular software available on the mac, and so does Macromedia.  And Living Language has their 9.0 versions of Language Lessons in plenty of European and Asian languages available on Mac.  Also, if your into Video, Adobe dropped Premiere because Final Cut Pro was kicking their but in earning the market share.  And if your into animation software, Cinema 4D 8.5v and Maya 5 both support mac, as well as Lightwave.  So as far as getting something done, the mac is awesome.. it doesn't freeze much if you treat it decent(don't run a zillion programs at once).  It simply works, and has better compatability than Linux.  Although Linux rocks too, Mac OS X is a Unix base with more compatability.  It is simply more compatable with stability than Linux.  Microsoft Windows?  Well, its compatable with a bonus of being hacked and virus wrecked and blue screened every so often.  In other words... Microsoft Windows tends to limit me getting anything done.. particularly in Graphics Design degree which of course is only macs.As far as games, of course most of the games out there are made for windows.  On the other hand, many might argue that if you are a real gamer, you own an XBox or a PS2 already.  Besides, Microsoft XP is available for Mac.  Like I said, get a G5 for that kind of thing.The chatting programs?  Well, Windows Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, and AOL instant messenger, as well as the OS X customized iChat version of AOL instant messenger that comes with any new mac.  The Yahoo Messenger can't do as much as it can on Windows.. on the other hand.. it doesn't get hacked like the one on Windows, which doesn't freeze my computer, which makes my life a bit easier.If you're into video, you should remember two things.. one, VCD format.  You know, that old laser disk format that any CD burner can place on a CD-R/RW.  two.. if your into business cards, the business card CD-Rs can hold video flash presentations as well.  So, basically, if your not looking for 2 hour movies on a dvd, you can easily burn animations as well as edit them from the CD-Rs on the iBooks.  The other detail is that 400 firewire is the only thing sold on iBooks.  800 firewire is considered 'professional'.  However, although my 400 dollar Olympus digital camera can make short videos, it, like many Digital Cameras on the market, does not have firewire.  In fact, that is much more likely to be restricted to digital camcorders.  Such as my Digital Camcorder does have.  Still, you still have to look for a firewire port, not all camcorders have them.Hopefully, you found my review helpful.  Oh, one more helpful hint.  Certain Epson scanners come with Photoshop Elements 2.0 .  A good piece of software with a needed accessory.  I definitely recommend it.  ArcSoftware is the usual accessory.  Don't be fooled.. although its fun and useful, for work with multiple photos, nothing beats Elements 2.0 .Hope you all enjoy this laptop if you buy it.  Obviously every business is out to make money and Apple is no different.  But Apple OS X and Apple laptops as a combo are better and more useful than nearly anything with Windows on it.Brian","Date":"December 17, 2003"}

It worked beautifully in the first few days. Then it would not start up at all. My wife called Apple tech supports. After few questions, the lady realized my wife was not quite knowledgeable in the iBook and required some hand holding to debug the problem. She hanged up on her. I would never expect Apple support people would do that at all!The 2nd tech support was much more helpful. After running some tests, he decided the hard disk was not working and asked my wife to bring it to a nearby Best Buy for repairing. Best Buy asked us to pay for the shipping fee. We then called the tech support again. We were asked to bring it to a nearby Apple store so we don't need to pay for the shipping fee due to it's within 90 days of the purchase.It looks like the tech supports were more interested in whether we wanted to buy their Apple Care than fixing our problem. I always have very high opinions on Apple products until now.Later on I found out Apple.com has lots of informaiton regarding iBook problems and how to fix them. I was able to fix the start up problem after I have tried several instructions at Apple.com. But the computer failed again with the same problem the very next day!

The typical failure is a really bad/sticky key (1st), a failure of some buttons on the synaptics track pad (2nd), a hard drive failure (3rd), or a failure of the power-port male plug, making it difficult (but not impossible) to charge the unit.  With the exception of the hard drive failure, NONE of the failures were catastrophic \"I cannot do any work right now\" type of failures, so the system is robust.The IBM repair manual is fantastic so I buy new parts on ebay and repair it myself.  I've replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).  The keyboard in particular takes 120 seconds to replace as it's just 5 screws and it pops out.","Date":"May 17, 2009"}

Overall lowest cost: after deducted the costs for 3-year warranty, high resolution LCD screen, Windows XP Pro, slim and light-weight design and quality material.2. Proven reliability: this means there won't be extra costs to burden my 3-year ownership.3. Excellent technical support (I called IBM technical support once in August, one month after I got T41, and was surprised that the tech. support rep. picked up the phone right the way and guided me step by step to go through the problem I had. They even followed up with a call to confirm the problem has been solved!Yes, I am more than happy to recommend IBM ThinkPad T41 (2379DJU) to you. However, the best buy is with $100 rebate from Amazon.","Date":"December 1, 2004"}

{"Title":"Fabulous, sturdy machine!","Author":"Lawks","ReviewID":"RUYDJ2B64VDU0","Overall":"good","Content":"Oh, Thinkpad, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways!I have never had a refurbished machine, so I was wary about glitches and bugs--but when my computer arrived, all my fears were laid to rest. This machine is huge, heavy, and STURDY AS BALLS. This is NOT a hoity-hoity little Macbook air that you're going to be afraid of breaking if you look crossways at it. This, my friends, is a F$#@ing Thinkpad. This guy eats 5 dozen eggs for breakfast. He can lift up a bench with three buxom lasses on it. He uses antlers in all of his decorating. Get the picture? Good.He is HEAVY and HUGE and I have named mine Moose.Now, granted, this is not a guy you can watch movies on, or play games on. This is definitely a computer for writing and surfing the web and basics like that. He CAN stream pandora or another music service, but tends to skip sometimes if you're doing anything else. He has a bit of trouble with flash-heavy webpages, but a good flashblocker add-on can help him with that. Budget your programs with him, don't ask him to do too much. I usually limit myself to a chat program (and I use Trillian 3.1 and AIM 5.9), Word, and Chrome. Definitely use the most streamlined versions of things on this guy, and he'll do you fine.Of course, there is the little matter of you being able to add space, speed, and so on with him. Thinkpads are probably the best kind of machine for upgrading. He's got space for more inside his casing, which is more than you can say for newer machines, that are just meant to be thrown out after a year.Another bonus is the full-size keyboard, the two types of mouse (a touchpad and the pointing stick, the latter of which has a middle button which I'm sure does SOMETHING but I don't know what), the very sturdy mouse-buttons (they're loud but push down satisfyingly), the status lights at the bottom of the monitor, and the little white LED on the top of the monitor, that illuminates the keyboard in the dark. There are also page forward and page back buttons on either side of the up key.I would say that if you're a writer in need of a laptop that'll survive the long haul, or if you're someone who appreciates a machine that will last you years instead of months, get this. Ffs there's a review in here from someone who's had their machine for five years!This guy won't steer you wrong, people.","Date":"October 18, 2012"}

{"Title":"IBM/Lenovo = The Finest Laptops Available","Author":"Richard Odato \"Slingboxer\"","ReviewID":"R2LPQKH83PFYDQ","Overall":"good","Content":"We purchased two T-41 laptops back in 2003.  Prior to that, we had a Dell - (TERRIBLE) computer, and a Toshiba - (bad) computer.  Our T-41s are still running fine.The T-41's are far superior in reliability.  IBM tech support is also far superior to Toshiba's and (especially) Dell's which was incredibly horrible.T-41's have arguably the best keyboard of any laptop ever.  They are sturdy, lightweight and travel well.  The performance is good - even compared to more modern machines.  We upgraded the hard drive capacity and after installing more memory, the speed increased dramatically.  With added memory, they even run Windoze 7 just fine. Try to get one with the 9,000 series video card.  They have much greater graphics resolution.Our brand-new T-41's cost about $1,400 each back in 2003.  Over the years, the T-41 line has become far less expensive on the used/refurb laptop market.  These computers were built for the corporate market and many of them were leased and returned for refurb.  You can buy one now for about $75-175 used.  That's quite a bargain.  As a result, we bought a few spare identical computers and if we have any problems with one, I just swap the hard drives and I'm back in business in 10 minutes.  That system works very well for us.We wish IBM were still making laptops instead of Lenovo, but it seems as though Lenovo is still maintaining good quality in their new machines.  Tech support is still provided by IBM, and as previously stated, it is truly outstanding and provided by English speaking Americans in Atlanta.","Date":"October 20, 2013"}
{"Title":"The worst five pound slab of junk you could ever buy and hopefully never rely upon.","Author":"Anonymous \"Anonymous\"","ReviewID":"R1Q4BGUSEYTK6J","Overall":"bad","Content":"Too bad that IBM (now Lenovo) ThinkPad's have really slid downhill, they break down just for the sport of it, there is growing number of web sites and complainants reporting a growing number of bizarre problems espeically with these older models and the new ThinkPads are getting worse while Lenovo keeps mortgaging their old reputation to command higher prices.The T41-T43's have a particularly stupid vulnerability, the motherboards can permanently fry from inserting a USB device !Hard to believe, but is a known problem (link to the community WiKi in the first comment) and the fix is even stranger if you don't want to keep buying new motherboards, you take a heat gun and \"reflow the motherboard\" after covering most of it aluminum foil.Buying new or used replacement parts for any ThinkPad is just as bad as shopping for antique Porsche parts because the tight knit community overcharges for everything. Thinkpads seem to kill batteries faster than the Arizona summer because I've never managed to get two years out of ThinkPad battery before it reports failures. The fans are noisier than hell and growl worse than horny house cats in the middle of April and those go bad requiring expensive replacements.It's too bad, ThinkPad's used to have legendary quality, they were the only laptops allowed on the International Space Station, IBM made the first tablet computer in the 1990's, these used to be innovators but now they're just the wallet invaders and for most new customers, their first ThinkPad decidedly becomes their last ThinkPad never willing to reconsider the headaches and hassles again.The ThinkPad community is literally guarded by miscreant owners too embarrassed to admit they made a mistake and eager to attack any critic and I expect to see this review attacked and buried in negative votes, that certainty underscores my assertions.Review the immediate comment since Amazon allows external links in comments for the authoritative ThinkPad sites that sheepishly admit just defective these things have become.","Date":"March 9, 2013"}

{"Title":"Only for the Simple","Author":"Cooking Mama","ReviewID":"RS8XVH8LXS0OH","Overall":"good","Content":"tl;dr Get this laptop for simple tasks like word processing or checking e-mail. Not best for entertainment purposes like watching dvds, gaming, and Skype calling.Clearly this is a cheap laptop and it's cheap for a reason. This laptop was manufactured by IBM who are famous for their Lenovo technology. Lenovo is a fairly good brand, so that's a plus.Pros: + price: It costed $130 used. + keyboard: I freakin' love typing on this thing. It has a nice feel. Don't judge me.Cons: - slow: It has a 1.6 GHz processor. What do you expect. It takes a while to start up and is kind of slow switching between tabs in Google Chrome depending on the level of content on a page and the number of tabs you have up. - clunky: This thing weighs about 11 pounds. The design is old looking & clunky. if you feel embarrassed using a dinosaur-looking machine, either don't use it in public or don't buy it. Haha.I got this laptop because I just needed a device to type my papers for my silly ENC1102 class. The reason why I got a laptop instead of a netbook was because of price and the laptop had a more comfortable viewing & typing size. I occasionally roam around Youtube, but its speed is fine. It may be a bit laggy at times if you're watching a DVD.Overall, this is a decent laptop for simple computing. Works best for word processing... anything productive. It fits all my needs for school.

So, when it came time for buying a home computer, I got the same iMac, but got the version with the larger screen and more memory at the advice of my wife. Well, we've blown two hard drives on the home iMac (covered under warranty, except for the lost files) and I'm rather annoyed. Nevertheless, I really like it as a computer. Alas, my wife likes it too and she's constantly working on eBay things. Too much so, in my opinion. I've been constantly on her for working at the computer all the time and blocking my usage. As a solution, she gave me an iBook G4 for Christmas (1907).I really like this little iBook. It's been completely trouble free, and in that respect is better than either of my iMacs. It's fast and my enjoyment of working on it greatly increased after I purchased a Mighty Mouse to go with it. I'm a college professor and I give about 12 classroom lectures per week. I also give visiting lectures (about 2 per month) all over Southern California. I store my PowerPoint presentations in the computer and it works out very well. I simply walk into a classroom or hall, plug in the equipment and I'm ready to go. Everything works real well, as long as I'm the one setting it up. When others have set it up, I've had a couple problems which they then blame on Apple equipment. There's an \"Apple Phobia\" that's widely prevelant. That's nonsense. It's their own ineptitude that's the problem. This is a real nifty computer and works splendidly for my purposes.Gary Peterson","Date":"February 4, 2009"}

One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap.

However, the laptop was in worse condition than described by the seller: on the outside everything was nice and shiny, but I guess nobody bothered to dust the inside of the poor thing. It took me about 20 minute and two cans of compressed air to make it look \"normal\"; the laptop came with a few missing screws, so I had to buy those as well; it coms with Windows XP Pro, SP1, so you'll need to do ALL the updates in the past 5 years. Loads of fun...All in all, the laptop runs great (once cleaned) and it was definitely worth its price.","Date":"November 2, 2010"}

{"Title":"Better than Windows Vista/7!","Author":"C. steele","ReviewID":"R2VZHNA5V4K7IZ","Overall":"good","Content":"1st, let me start by saying, I've never really been the biggest fan of laptops in general but for this I have to make an exception. Windows XP will always be BETTER than all other operating systems. Yeah I said it! From my experience with the more advanced windows such as windows 7/Vista they have always been too faulty with all sorts of random errors: Slow starting up, Trouble/Slow connecting, freezing, blank outs screens, the list just goes on & on. So random, Its annoying. I find that they over-do it with the more advanced systems, I really don't think most laptops are designed to handle all that. I much prefer this in Windows XP(Pro)! I find its more concrete, more sturdy, & I can turn them on with no surprises waiting for me. I have had very few troubles with it so far: Its fast, large screen, nice to look at, reliable, easy to customize. It even connected to my wireless internet right away & with no prompt. The battery life is decent as well though I always keep it plugged anyway. The only problem is this tea kettle whistling noise the battery occasionally makes when plugged but I hardly notice it most of the time. This is a win win for me in terms of price & quality esp since I find this better than any of the more expensive brands. What a Steal. Ofcourse the RAM, Free space & Memory is pretty small but that doesn't matter for me since I don't plan on downloading or saving much of anything at all. I'm sure I'll have to be very careful with this thing. I just hope the computer never crashes on me, that's my only concern.  But good so far. Highly Recommended it. :)","Date":"January 12, 2012"}

Now, if you're looking for something sleek and futuristic this laptop is not for you, but if you want to listen to music, stream videos, do some word-processing and browse the web this computer is perfect. The wireless also works great. I can't believe it was under $200. It was worth every penny. I bought this when my HP laptop crapped out. It was a little over three years old. I can't afford a new computer right now and needed something just for those basic functions I listed above. The computer's old so the battery doesn't really hold a charge. It's also not the lightest so I don't leave home with it very often. It runs Windows XP, so you can't install some recent and complicated software (ex. I couldn't install the software for my Zune mp3 player, but I had no problem with Spotify). These are the only minor complaints that I have. The only thing that I wish it had is a webcam, but that's not a big deal. I don't really Skype that much anyway. This laptop gives you more than enough bang for your buck. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a cheap and simple machine that they're going to mostly keep in the house.","Date":"August 23, 2012"}
{"Title":"Perfect for what I need...","Author":"John C","ReviewID":"R1K4XIWALMBYCV","Overall":"good","Content":"For the price of this laptop it's unbeatable. It actually came with Windows 7 installed and not XP. I was a little concerned at first that it might have trouble running Windows 7 but so far so good. This is really just a back up for me and all I really need to do is surf the net, send emails maybe watch an occasional video. It's running great, surfs the net with good speed, boots up pretty quickly. The only thing that seems a little lacking is the battery life. I usually have it plugged in anyway so it's not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life. Not terrible but not great. It lasted a couple hours before I had to plug it back in. All things considered, I am very happy with this laptop. If you are looking for something to use for simple applications and surfing the web then you really can't go wrong here.","Date":"September 1, 2011"}

{"Title":"Pretty good machine for a great price","Author":"Wikileaker","ReviewID":"R2SW9C7YN5U1XY","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm tempted to award five stars, but there are a few issues with this very good and affordable laptop.First, don't believe the Technical Details data on the 802.11 Wifi. I got mine from U.S. Micro and couldn't get the wifi working. An email from their tech support stated that they check their machines for wifi card being installed before they ship, but sometimes they forget. I got one without the wifi circuit card, and they promptly replaced the laptop with another that did. Just remember, Amazon's T43 web page indicates wifi as being a built-in feature, but it is NOT. You need to check with the seller before you buy. Also need to make sure it comes with the correct driver installed, otherwise you'll need another computer to download it. (note: according to U.S. Micro, there are two possible wifi cards, the IBM and the Intel. You need to install the correct driver for your particular wifi circuit card)Who knows what else might be listed as a standard feature, but isn't really? I can't tell yet; everything else seems to work okay so far on my machine. The T43 can come in various configurations, and it comes in two different screen sizes (14.1 inch and 15 inch).This laptop gets pretty hot after 30 minutes or so.Two USB ports is a little skimpy for some people. Consider a USB hub, or the T60/T61 which has three USB ports. Other than USB, has oodles of I/O ports, even a good old-fashioned IrDA for hotsyncing my Clie and Handera PDAs.Otherwise, this is a reliable and solidly built computer. Good performance even being some 7 years old. A champ!

That only added $12 to the total. It works fine for the limited tasks I want it to do. Cosmetically in perfect condition. Screen is in good shape. The one odd thing that caught my attention had to do with one software program that was installed, which I had not expected to be installed: PowerPoint. I was glad to have it, but there were a few fragments of old PowerPoint presentations still on the machine, from some business that had owned the computer before. It wasn't much, but usually refurbished computers won't have anyone's old data at all. Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow.

The only thing I could do to stop the overheating was to buy a small 6 inch fan with a clamp on it, clamp it to my desk, and point it directly at the rear of the laptop.This is poorly designed in my opinion.  From reading other reviews around the world, I understand this model has been discontinued, Toshiba customer service is an abomination, and the speakers are made of metal and there is a shock/reboot problem on some machines.  0_oAnd if that is not enough for ya, it periodically boots with the sound disabled.

{"Title":"Dependable system, nightmare company","Author":"J. Leary \"jleary\"","ReviewID":"R3GBNEZJXDH3EY","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned a Gateway M305CRV for nearly 4 years.  The processor is a 2.4GHz mobile celeron and I installed 1GB of Ram (system max).  I also upgraded the hard drive to 100GB, which the system handles with no issues.Despite the fact that the processor is the older single core vs. the newer dual core intel and AMD models, the performance is still comparable.  I use the sytem for surfing the web, e-mail, photo editing, some video editing, and standard word and spreadsheet processing.  I have also used it periodically for database development in Access.While you cannot use the more demanding programs (such as Access or photoshop elements) simultaneously without bogging the system down somewhat, the performance is still on par with newer processors for working in a single application.  I have owned several different models of the Gateway laptops and Dell laptops, and I find in general that the Gateway models seem more efficient that the Dells. The downside of the Gateway's is the customer service.  If you don't need tech support and can do your own upgrades for most items you would want to change (such as RAM, hard drive, optical drive, etc.) don't be afraid of a Gateway.","Date":"March 18, 2008"}

I'm just now looking to replace it and that it how I stumbled I came upon these reviews.Maybe I've been very lucky, but I'd have to say that this laptop has done it's job very well.  For starters, I needed something cheap (~$750, as I recall) that could primarily perform basic tasks.  No probs there.  And no others for the last 8 years, with the exception that the battery did die on my a few years ago.  That's a bummer, but, I think, a common problem not limited to Gateway.Now, the power connection or the AC adapter itself is having problems and sometimes it goes on an extended jag of giving me pop up msgs that I need to reconnect the AC because the battery is about dead.  Also, one of the keyboard letters got stuck at a weird angle and I popped it off trying to fix it.  That'll never go back on.  Along with everything else, screen technology has improved greatly so my screen looks pretty  dull compared to newer machines.Still, we are talking about a very old laptop, here.  If my next one gives me anywhere near this level of service I'll be a very happy man.","Date":"November 3, 2009"}

Fortunately, like most, I got a perfect working Gateway M305CRV years ago and it still bulldozes through whenever I need it to. Powerful enough to use high graphics software like Photoshop CS3 and connects to internet perfectly. I've never had any system problems (other than the ones I brought upon myself lol). The bad reviews are probably true but I think it's because they had a bad system. Notice there are only a few?? lol The rest, like me got the real deal. D*** fine computer!

{"Title":"PC to Mac","Author":"NavySeal","ReviewID":"R1IZQWJJ73YP8C","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me start by saying that I've been using PCs my whole life and I am now 17.  I decided to buy a Macbook Pro for college because I am going two years before I would have actually gone to college.  I was torn between the 15 inch and 13 inch.  I decided on the 15 inch because I do a lot of programming, mostly for fun, but I'm also on a robotics team, because I'm a Physics major.  I decided on the 15 inch model and I'm very happy that I did.  The screen size is perfect for extended periods of use while programming.  The free software on the Mac store called xCode is a great application.I've used PCs all of my life and the Mac OS is head over heels better than all of the Windows OS versions.  Although, Windows 7 is a much closer competitor.Parallels Desktop 7 allows you to run Windows 7 on your Mac also, this adds the best of both worlds.  Mac's killer OS and Windows' programs.Pros:Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!!  I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.It is extremely fast.The screen size is perfect.The Mac App Store is great.The keypad is backlit.Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.The battery life is good.Cons:It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn't get proper ventilation.Glossy screen, but for me it isn't that bad.The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.  It also adds so many things you can do in the way of note taking, applications that help you brainstorm for writing papers.  It has been a big help with my 5 page essays.I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes to program because the screen size is perfect for extended periods of use.  This is a great computer.  It would be even better if you have an iPad or iPhone.  If you have either of those than I would strongly suggest you get a Macbook because of the application compatibility.  This is a great computer and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  The heat only happens if you have it suffocated by your lap.  This is a great computer and you should definitely get it for college, or any other work related things.","Date":"September 26, 2011"}

The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.The good* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.Not so good* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.* The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5\" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one.","Date":"December 4, 2011"}

Very satisfied so far.  Feels like the sturdiest, best designed laptop I've ever owned.My only complaint is that as of today (09/19/2011), Amazon's product description states that \"This Mac comes pre-installed with OS X Snow Leopard, but you can order a free upgrade to OS X Lion...\"  In fact, it ships with Lion pre-installed.  Dozens (if not hundreds) of major 3rd party applications have yet to announce compatibility with Lion, so this can be a significant issue for quite some time.  Amazon is not \"set up\" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it's still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I'll update this review as soon as it's published.","Date":"September 19, 2011"}
{"Title":"Upgraded from MBP 13","Author":"Art","ReviewID":"R9YIGDKO5ZW5","Overall":"good","Content":"The 13 inch MBP 2010 was my first mac and I thought it was the best laptop I ever used. Recently I got a special deal on the MBP 15 inch 2011 and decided to upgrade although the price of this thing is quite  high. Right away I busted this thing open, took out the DVD drive and installed a INTEL 120 GB SSD drive in it's place. Now I have 2 drives. The SSD is for OS X + software and the 500 GB spinning HD is for video since I use this to edit HD video H.265 filesAll I can say is that it made quite a difference after the switch from 13 inch. Running Premiere CS5.5 is much more spaced out and comfortable on the 15 inch. Much faster processor too.Internally the MBP 13 uses 1 fan and a small speaker attached to the main board. The 15 inch has 2 fans and 2 real speakers. There are other additions but you can look at apple's site yourself if you want to compare the models.With the SSD drive installed, my applications load instantly and everything is faster than a Macbook Air.Although I was loyal to Windows and PC all my life, I can now tell you that the average user would fall in love with OS X Lion compared to using Windows. Windows is sloppy, virus prone and doesn't operate smoothly with its hardware as Mac products do. I used many windows laptops and they all feel cheap and the trackpad always sucks no matter how expensive the unit is. Lots of people around me switched to Mac after playing with my laptop. A granny can learn to use a new mac in 1 hour while a PC might get tossed out the window.I know you've heard it before but I switched to Mac and don't plan on going back to PC.","Date":"August 14, 2011"}

{"Title":"It's Hard To Give A Complete Review Of A Notebook","Author":"Mister Murse","ReviewID":"R2IBXAWR86PKXL","Overall":"good","Content":"There are many different factors to consider when writing a review of a notebook, but I'm just going to go with the topics hardware and software.First, the exterior/hardware. This is the first thing that you see when unboxing so it only felt right to start here. Of course when you open it you're in the awe of actually owning an Apple machine. The aluminum unibody is extremely attractive, clean, and just stunning. Then more time sets in, and if you're like me, you begin to inspect it, wondering if it really is as perfect as you first thought it to be. Upon inspection of this machine (my 1st of two, BTW) I noticed there were some flaws. First, I noticed when the lid was closed, there was a gap on the right side (the drive side) compared to the left. Upon further inspection, eyeballing at an angle I find hard to describe, I can see an imperfection in the form of the aluminum, as if it was bent. Secondly, after some use, I also noticed two of the backlighting on the keys, keys 'B' and '7' were noticeably dimmer than their counterparts. Lastly, upon inspecting the powercord, it looks like there are some imperfections in the sheathing...I don't know from what or how, but just another thing to make my mind boggle. For a machine of this price and from a company like Apple where form and function are supposedly equal, I personally could not 'suck it up' and live with these things, but I'm sure there are those out there who would...to each is own. But other than those things, it definitely is a striking machine that leaves an impression.Second, the software. Being this is my first time owning an Apple and working with OS X, I have to say I am pleased right from the get go. It truly is simple to use. I don't know how else to explain it, but I've been using Windows for years, and after a short time, a couple weeks on a Mac, I feel quite oriented with it. Setting up things seem much less painful on a Mac, as the system often recognizes things in advance, ie setting up an internet connection. For the experienced, not impressive by any means, but for those who have trouble fathoming wireless anything, it works like it's supposed to without needing to be \"experienced.\" I'm sitting here trying to think of a more compelling example to share, but all I can really tell you is that things work in a straight forward way. Recalling my Windows experiences, there are often multiple sidesteps that would be taken to finally reach a certain destination, but here its a straight shot.Personal experience: As stated above, due to the hardware issues/imperfections, I bought a second MacBook Pro and returned the first one. I truly love my second one, as all the hardware imperfections are no longer there...the lid is even all the way around, the backlights work on all the keys, the power cord doesn't have any weird marks. I'm happy. I will say though, I don't know if Amazon was trying to be slick or if it's common practice, but the box this 2nd one came in I noticed had been opened before and a new clear piece of tape was placed over it. I'm not entirely sure what that means? I will also say too that the first one ran much cooler, as this one seems a bit warmer...(uh oh, did I make things worse for myself?) Not hot enough where I feel like I'm getting burned, but noticeably warmer...but I have read things about 'thermal paste' on these MBPs being excessively used, so I'm not sure...have to look further into that. But all in all, this is what I initially expected, form and function are top notch, as they should be to match the cost.MBP #1: 3 starsMBP #2: 4/4.5 stars (Would be 5 stars if it operated at the same cooler temperature as the first one)","Date":"July 2, 2011"}

The closest I got to a Mac was in school and I thought they were terrible.Back to 2011, I felt the need to buy a new laptop to replace my existing Windows 7 laptop (i wanted a sandy bridge and faster laptop). I was hesitant at first because of the ridiculous pricing but this macbook pro changed my mind entirely of my perception of macs.The laptop finishes booting up a few seconds quicker than my Acer laptop and the user interface was beautiful in its simplicity. This is the key word here folks: simplicity. Windows involve more menu clicking and finding compared to a Mac. Dont get me started on the screen, WOW! My eyes WILL get used to this when studying. In fact, it will make studying easier because the screen doesnt have dull areas like on my acer. Now the trackpad, it is the best trackpad I have used. You can move on the trackpad and click simultaneously without letting go of your finger. I like the chiclet keys plus the backlighting LED makes it look cool. The side speakers have incredible volume that I actually have to LOWER the volume because it was just too loud! My acer's volume fail in comparison but Acer's laptop have a smaller speaker.Overall:Apple Macbook Pro design is sophisticated, clean, and functional. I feel like a heavy burden has left my shoulder thanks to the nice trackpad, screen resolution and quality, and overall ease of use of Mac's OS X Lion.Apple has converted me from PC's!

I was also considering the 13\" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z. All of them are worthy laptops. I was attracted to the XPS as it is very well priced and a great looking laptop. But in the end I stuck with Mac. I have been a Mac user since about 2002. So, all my private software etc is Mac. Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac. So then had to decide on whether I go for the 13\" or not. I have always had the 13\" models. In the end I went for the 15\" because the sound is better and the sheer power of the laptop is brilliant.

I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon. I think 4GB of ram is more than enough for anyone, but I may upgrade to 8GB of ram in the future. Battery life is beyond what they claim if you turn down the obvious battery drainers. (Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon.

I had sold my last Macbook (White polycarbonate) to go traveling and bought a Dell instead. It wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had. My Dell wasn't an entry level laptop it was actually the XPS M1330 with all the options. After upgrading to Win7 I thought my laptop was fast enough and the screen was bright and crisp. After breaking it I decided it was time to go back to a mac. I wasn't disappointed.This laptop can run laps around my Dell. Paired with a Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS-Bare Drive This laptop is faster than most $2300+ Windows computers and outperforms any windows pc in terms of start up/standby/resume/shutdown speed. I find that the graphics switching helps keep the laptop cool and the fan quiet under normal web browsing and document drafting. 3D drawings load quickly and you rarely find any lag while working on large 3D projects.I only carry the charger everywhere with me because I never know when I'm going to be spending extra time in the library or spending all day away from home. However I rarely find that I need to plug in during a normal day of classes and some study time inside the library. In case you need to fuel up between meetings and whatnot the battery charges to 80% fairly quickly.Usability is greatly improved over Windows machines with the extra large trackpad that conveniently doesn't get in the way while you're typing on the full size keyboard that is a joy to type on. I find that with the keys the way they're designed has me typing ~10 WPM more than other less intuitively designed keyboards. The backlight in the keys also help when you're on a plane or other dark places like certain lecture halls. It does however eat up more juice than I'd like.If your anticipating on doing more Graphics design or 3D drawing I would suggest upgrading to the Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop otherwise this will be more than plenty to satisfy the general user and student.

{"Title":"Replaced my 13 2010 MBP","Author":"A Techy Guy","ReviewID":"R1LL4PVFKDETRK","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me start off by saying I have always been a pc guy until I purchased my 2010 macbook pro 13' last year and I must say I don't know why I waited so long! I purchased my 13 back in September and about 6 months later I saw the new MacBook pros came out and comparing the specs I felt like I needed to upgrade. I replaced my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 with this and I must say that I am very pleased. The dual core on the 2010 seemed fast but when compared to the i7 quad core the dual core isn't even in the same universe! The 15' is super fast and great at handling multiple apps at once. The new Lion OSX is excellent and apple has added  a lot of things to make this os superb to others. The only drawback is that Apple has axed rosetta which means power pc run applications and games are no longer supported. However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs). The battery life on this laptop is great. I can usually get 6 to 8 hours of life from a single charge depending on what I am doing. Most laptops can only get 3 or 4 max. The battery can actually be calibrated to help get the most out of a charge. Ilife 11 is a great addition with this laptop and apps like iMovie and iPhoto couldn't be easier to use. Portability isn't as good as the 13' but with this computer being pretty much 2x-3x faster that the 2010 13' I'm not complaining. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if your thinking about converting to a Mac, DO IT! You will be very satisfied.PROS1. The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).2. The battery life is great. ( A little less than my 2010 13' mbp but it averages about 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on what I'm doing so I'm not complaining)3. Osx Lion is a great upgrade from snow leopard and does a great job at keeping everything organized and fast.4. Great apps included like Garageband and iPhoto.5. The case looks very sleek, thin, and professional and the backlit keyboard can be super bright or dim depending on how you want it.6. Bootcamp is a great feature that many people may not know used to run windows on your mac if needed. 7. The screen is extremely bright and big and hd videos look crisp and clear.CONS1. Price is a little steep compared to other pc's with the same specs.2. When running windows the laptop can get very warm.3. In the new Lion OSX power pc run apps and games is not supported anymore.","Date":"August 14, 2011"}

I was a little wary at first never having really used a Mac before, but today I can easily say that I'm happy with it. I'm not particularly computer savvy (and I won't pretend otherwise) so the computer is more than likely capable of far more than I use it for, but it does everything I want very well. Perhaps my favorite thing is the quick start up time, from turning my computer on it literally takes less than half a minute to get full speed. My only real complaint or observation is that the area just above the keyboard can get very hot with extended use. Great laptop.","Date":"August 3, 2011"}

When I used to compare it with my personal windows laptop, actually I could not compare...there was nothing to compare. Macbook was light years ahead of it. Another plus was that with Mac OSX, you can surf the web without worrying the intrusion of spywares and viruses in your machine, effectively eliminating the need for an anti virus. All these factors were compelling enough for me to shell out 1700$ to make it mine.I have now upgraded to LION OS and oh boyyy...using it is like biting through a cheesecake...smooth! I also do a lot of photography and developing pics is just an out of the world experience on Mac. The screen is so vibrant that the pics almost speak out. I have a glossy screen and since I mostly use it indoors, I got no issues. In fact I love it more than the anti-glare one.Coming to the performance, well this is supposed to the most advanced laptop in the market and it truly lives up to its name. The booting (after installing LION) is around 30-40 seconds! The clicks are so responsive that I have forgotten what latency is, the speakers are a nice addition and it even has a slot for SDHC cards...I can just takes pics and insert the memory card directly into this slot and boom...its done. Goodbye USB cables, now I don't need to depend on you. Lastly the batter life is amazing, it gives me around 6 hrs on normal work and around 5-5.5 hours with wi-fi on.All in all, thumbs up for Macbook Pro and also to Amazon for letting me have a 100$ waiver.","Date":"July 30, 2011"}

I needed a Macbook Pro with a built in optical drive due to the nature of of my work so I didn't want to get the latest model of the Macbook Pro.  Although this review is not for the seller, I will just say that this laptop was in pristine condition and everyone that I have shown it to says that it looks brand new.That said, the Quad Core i7 in this machine is perfect.  The only thing i did is upgrade the RAM.  It is very fast for all tasks and I do a lot of media heavy (i.e. - audio and video editing) things that require a lot.  Is it a Mac Pro?  Certainly not, but by necessity I do much of my work on the go and a desktop is out of the question most of the time.Even though this machine is a couple years old it has more than enough horsepower for 99.9% of standard computer users and even though for power users.  If you want the latest/greatest like Retina display, thinner, lighter, then this isn't for you, but if you want an laptop with a built in optical drive that still delivers on the power side, this Macbook Pro definitely delivers.

{"Title":"Replacing my road worn Titanium PowerBook...","Author":"David M \"professordavid\"","ReviewID":"R5ZO8S07NR97A","Overall":"good","Content":"I just received my new 17\" MacBook Pro. I was a bit reluctant to replace my totally worn out PB 15 Titanium which is over 4 years ago: dings, replaced frames, and other maladies from falls, travel, etc. \"Reluctant\" due to the new operating system, new chips, new about everything. And then there's the issue of a ton of gigabytes and programs moved over to a new machine. Geez. What's that... days of adjustment, reloading, re-installing, and finding serial numbers.Before that though, the experience of taking it from its box was remarkable. Who else but Apple would think about the slick box that it comes in? But the accessory box was missing... or was it. The cable adapters were there, a cool remote control (that works with Keynote), and a tight little kit of DVDs and DVD-sized books. That was it. Of course, I didn't read anything... I'm too impatient.So, that takes me to set-up etc. I started it up, it asked if I had a Mac and would I like to migrate my files (and applications). I said yes. It demanded a Firewire cable for the deed, I complied [not provided, but I had one]. About an hour later, I had a fully operational MacBook with all of my old applications working. No dragging, serial number stuff, or otherwise (so far, that is). A seamless transition. I did need to state that my music would be authorized on the new computer. The easiest move ever. As though I was using my old computer with everything intact, but now a new, wide screen, ultrafast environment. So a little over an hour after taking it out of the box, I was using Creative Suite and other apps with abandon.I don't want to discuss all the enhancements and how well they work since better reviewers than I have already done so. But I will do a few highlights. First, the wide screen is real estate I sorely needed (and no twisting that might cause the battery to drop out), not too heavy, but real estate and bright. It rests for hours on my leg and I fell no excess heat. The new magnetic charger connection is great: as you approach the plug it literally is sucked into the connection. And the lighted keyboard for dark room users -- awesome.So far, all of my applications work except Virtual PC which I anticipated. I did need to trash the try-out Microsoft suite since my licensed version was co-installed (and doubling clicking took me to the try-out version rather than my version).I haven't tried the emulation via Boot Camp, but perhaps the Parallels Virtual System might be better. The latter offers simultaneous operation. I have no choice since an important testing system is PC only, and we use it for 1000 students year.As we would all expect, everything moves so totally quickly, that I have few barriers to productivity. And that was an initial fear. So this is a brief review focussed more on migration and seamless operation. In these respects, I could not be happier. It's a Mac, in spite of the Intel processor, with all the usual simplicities and convenience. Other barriers to productivity? I haven't found them yet.","Date":"June 18, 2006"}

For less money, you can get a cheap PC laptop that weighs 15lbs and is about 3\" thick to absorb the heat it generates. If you want the best in portables without sacrificing screen real estate, this is the one to get.The MagSafe power adapter is pure genius. No more cats or kids making your investment fly across the livingroom. If your foot snags on the power cord, it yanks out of the portable, instead of denting your DC-in board or crashing your computer to the ground.FrontRow offers you what no other portable has - remote control for your tunes, your videos and your entire iLife. iLife '06 is pre-installed and other than perhaps a carrying case and a copy of Microsoft Office, you won't find yourself having to buy a lot of stuff to go with your investment. It just works, and comes with industry clad software that also simply works and yields stunning results.No viruses, no malware, no spyware, no worries. Be sure to snag an AppleCare protection plan with your purchase. AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) covers your computer for 3 years... otherwise you have a one year warranty and out of warranty repairs for portables are not cheap... starting at about $310 out of warranty.If you're used to using your portable for faxing, you'll need to pick up a USB modem. Apple believes that modems have gone the way of the Do-Do bird, despite the fact that all fax machines still use 28k-56k modems. Who knows what tomorrow may bring, though. Apple was the first to ditch the floppy drive, and thank goodness they did! They got a lot of heat over that decision, but it is a trend the industry has now embraced.","Date":"May 20, 2006"}

I priced this a comparable on Dell and a few other model and either way you slice it this will cost north of $3,000.  Whether it's a high end gaming device, whatever, it will cost you.  My MBP came in at slightly over $3,100 and that included Aperture and 3 years of support.  I dare anyone to make a case for a cheaper alternative with a PC.- Quality: What can you say?  The heat output on this is about the same as other Intel based machines I've had.  It sounds like that is more than the traditional Mac laptops, but as far as Intel laptops go it's about the same.  All of the other cosmetic stuff is just fine.- Application Support: There is plenty written about Photoshop CS2 running on MacTel machines and the performance issue.  I read some of the tests, and no only were they unusually taxing given typical use of PS, they were unrealistic for all but the photo pro who must process large numbers of complex batch jobs.- Support:  I have called Apple support a few times.

My new MacBook Pro (MBP) 17\" died 6 hours into its life.  Conversations with Apple confirmed the situation, but since I had purchased my MBP at an Apple retailer (not an Apple Store), all Apple could do is schedule it in for repair, but they recommended that I return it as DOA.  I knew my local Fry's Electronics sold me the last MBP17\" they had, but Fry's checked the other stores in the DFW area and found another store with several still in stock.  it was a 120 mile round trip but at least I got a brand new MBP and life has been WONDERFUL since.  I am a long time Windows user, but I also am very comfortable in the Mac environment( as well as UNIX).  I purchased Parallels Desktop for Mac (FORGET Bootcamp) and loaded in XP Pro and the various Windows apps that I knew I would need either due to lack of comparable Mac software or during the transition.  The MBP has to be experienced to be believed.  XP running in a Virtual Machine (VM Parallels Desktop) is WAY faster than native on a  1.8GHZ ATHLON/512MB machine. OSX Tiger is LIGHTYEARS ahead of XP and Leopard looks like it will leapfrog whatever Vista actually becomes.  It does take some getting use to having to use the function key + delete or home or end or pageup or page down to get the those functions in XP, but once you get the hang of it no problem.  I also got the Apple Mighty Mouse and it makes XP a LOT nicer than trying to work with a single button mouse.  I am upgrading to 2GB of Ram since OSX and XP running at the same time chews through the standard 1GB completely (11-15MB left).  Once a 7200RPM Perpendicular Recording is available from Hitachi, I will be moving up from the standard 120GB/5400RPM drive.If you are a Windows user and want to move to the realm of the enlightened, buy a MBP and Parallels Desktop for Mac for those moments when you need a fix of XP.","Date":"September 1, 2006"}

When Apple came out with the duo core Intel processor, I still wasn't convinced that I could happily move to a new system. Let me tell you; it is the finest computer I have ever owned! I have this gut feeling that Apple made this dual OS move to convince PC users once and for all; this is the only computer you will ever want.There is plenty of support out there for learning the new language of Mac, but it is amazingly easy. The first thing you must learn is that Mac is intuitive. I was prepared to go through pages of setup instructions to hook up my internet, but Mac did it all for me, no questions, no permissions, just had to enter my WEP key to enter my service provider environment. WOW!Switching between systems? Boot, hold down the 'options' key, and choose your system. I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.What is hard to get used to? No 'delete' key (Mac has a 'delete' key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse 'click' functions to delete things. Also, No 'home' or 'end' keys. All the above functions require 2 key-strokes on the Mac.This is the only trouble I have found; It pales in comparison to the nightmares of Virus software, updates for security and everything else that seemed to drag my old system down.

I'll list the pros and cons of the 17\" Pro.Pros1. ENORMOUS SCREEN - I literally have two desktop computers at home that have smaller screens!2. Built in iSight - Convenient3. MagSafe Connector - innovative, especially around clumsy people and children4. Duo core processor - The power doesn't show up unless you're doing intensive graphics work or programming5. Keys that light up in the dark - Even though I can type without looking at the keys, it's great when you're on the train and can find the function key6. Bluetooth - for obvious reasons7. Firewire 800 - for obvious reasonsCons1. Probably the biggest is the surprising amount of defects and poor customer support for their products. I get my computers from my job and we got them as soon as they were available. That might have been a mistake, as we ran into a number of defects, including the infamous mac shutdown problem. Just do a search for \"random mac shutdown\" on google to see he horror. Someone even filmed their problem and showed it on youtube. I won't go through the other defects other than to say I wouldn't DREAM of getting a MacBook/Pro without getting an extended warranty. As others have also mentioned, the turn around time for them to fix your product is VERY slow, and we should have preferntial treatment with them, considering we do work for them (won't go into further details on that). Ultimately, if Apple realizes they've put out a defective product, the solution (especially on a $3000 laptop) would be to send out the white macbook as a loaner while they waited for parts to arrive.2. Probably not the most conducive for the train. I got this laptop simply because I had the option to. If you travel a lot, you'd probably be better off with a 13\" MacBook as opposed to this. If you're on a plane or train, you'll quickly realize just how big this laptop is. However, since there's no way to make a 17\" also small at the same time, just note what I'm saying. Sometimes it's great that the screen is so huge. Sometimes it's slightly inconvenient.4. The placement of the keys. This might also be due to the large size, but there is a lot of space between the keyboard and the mouse area. I initally found my wrists resting on this area and it was starting to cause me pain. I therefore now have to type with my wrists slightly elevated to avoid resting my hands on an area that simply would not be there on a smaller laptop. The only solution to this problem would be to move the keyboard forward.As a final note, unless you're doing extensive graphics work, my opinion is that you'll get more bang for the buck by getting the black 13\" MacBook. The speed difference between the Pro and the MacBook is 0.16 MHz, basically negligible. In my case, I hook up the laptop to a 23\" screen at work, so only when I'm on the road is the size of the screen even an issue anyway. And again, if you're not doing extensive graphics work, I'd say it's not worth it. For half the price, you can get more bang for the buck.","Date":"December 16, 2006"}

I am also a graphic designer and photographer and I push my machines to their limits on a daily basis. I adored my 17\" Powerbook and, due to someone in my corporate IT department dropping my Powerbook, was forced to get a new MacBook to replace it. The transition hasn't been a smooth one.If you are a designer or photographer (after all, isn't that who Apple supposedly builds these machines for?) you will immediately notice that Adobe has not yet rewritten their suite for the new Intel processors. This means serious lag whilst they run through Rosetta. Not pretty. If you routinely create and work with large layered files in Photoshop as I do, plan to stay late at work more often.Another major issue has been the heat of the processors. The back of my MacBook Pro is so hot I can only touch it for a couple of seconds (top and bottom). Mind you, I have this machine seated on an iCurve stand which allows air to flow all around the machine. I rarely hear the fan/s kick on and I worry about traveling with this unit. You cannot place it on your lap and when I am in hotels I am nervous about having it seated directly on a wooden desk. Sounds like a future recall to me.We professionals know that the first issue of most Apple products are far from the best. My advice? Wait until Adobe releases CS3 next Spring (perhaps before Macworld in January). By that point many of these issues may be ironed out. Until then, I'm longing for my mangled Powerbook.","Date":"September 10, 2006"}

{"Title":"Very happy so far","Author":"N. Caine","ReviewID":"R1JAV35KNABY2Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I got this to succeed an HP Pavilion AMD Duron ZE series laptop.  I got the HP a few years ago after trying a lot of laptops, because I liked the keyboard feel (I typed without looking on many keyboards and the HP had the fewest keyboard-caused typos) and I found the text sharp.  Over time I was held back by:  1) the sound never worked without stuttering, 2) even with a memory upgrade, it was very slow running XP SP2, and 3) the screen was hard to read in a brightly lit room.  I could fix none of these, even after removing every memory resident program, uninstalling all unnecessary software, and using a professional defrag program. But the laptop otherwise served me well.  One thing I learned about laptops:  their performance is influenced largely by the rotational speed of the hard drive and the amount of memory you put in.The Toshiba, which I got on sale, has been a joy.  For a budget laptop, it is one of the few I have found with a 5400 rpm hard drive, and that has made a huge difference!  I also added more memory (512 should be your minimum, but adding a 1 gig module is advised).  Everything works quickly and I have found no little annoying things!  The screen is marvelous:  huge and bright.  Dvd's are gorgeous, especially when using the Dvd player's widescreen mode.  The sound is great.  4 high speed USB ports are wonderful, as they fill up quickly!  The wireless not only works very well, but has a conveniently located on/off switch, so you can turn it off to save energy, a feature not available on the wireless card I added to the HP.  I also like the fact that the Toshiba's only \"extra\" buttons are dvd-type controls (play, pause, etc.).  I find too many extra buttons goofy.  The Toshiba is also lighter than the HP and is thinner.  I'm amazed.On the down side, yes they saved money on the battery.  I do not have experience of long battery lives on laptops in the past couple of years anyway, so I wasn't surprised.  The battery comes out easily if you want to buy an extra.  I'm used to taking my a/c adapter everywhere.  Yet another pleasant surprise is that the a/c adapter is smaller and lighter than my HP's.  Since I take it wherever I take the laptop, this is actually an important feature!Overall, I'm thrilled.  I've read some complaints about other variations of the Satellite line, but I have read of no problems with the A105 series, and this was a very important consideration for me.","Date":"February 27, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent multi-use bargain laptop","Author":"Kevin M. Holmgren \"Gadget Guy\"","ReviewID":"R2LMTJ541WOBBY","Overall":"good","Content":"I am compelled to echo my felow Satellite owner from NV. I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for $499 with a free RAM upgrade to 512. I needed to replace my 6-year-old Dell Inspiron 7000 that was just getting too clunky and trouble-prone, the main problem being it took a full 15 minutes to start up. Anyway I want to talk about the Satellite not the Inspiron. The 15.1 inch wide screen is deliciously beautiful. I cannot accent this point enough. Fantastic for web surfing, dvd viewing, digital snapshot sharing, Hauppauge USB TV viewing, anything. The sound is also top-rate, excellent stereo separation, which I was surprised to hear on most commercials when I started using my above-mentioned USB TV tuner, which I will review separately (mini- review = excellent).The weight is perfect for carrying around constantly for whatever use you may think of, this laptop is really an all-around jack of all trades.Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the short battery life. One hour seems to ne the limit, grossly short compared to my Dell Inspiron. Of course that is not a reflection on the laptop as much as it is on the battery - just get a better one or a spare one.Also need to warn buyers that what brings the price down markedly is the fact that it only comes (at least mine did) with a 6-monh trial of MS Word, Excel, & PowerPoint, but I solved this problem by backing up my 6-year-old Dell to a 300 gb Seagate external hard drive, and all those apps seem to run on the Satellite off the Seagate drive. Also, Sun has free beta programs that mimmick them.So if you see this laptop in the $500 range, grab it - you won't be sorry.","Date":"April 18, 2006"}

I bought this at BestBuy March 2006 for 499.00 with free upgrade from 256RAM to 512RAM, it has been a fine computer so far. I upgrade to 2Gig. Nothing went wrong to the point where it does not function. There are a few clitches, but it came back normal. I regularly defrag. & clean-up, this is important PC maintaince. I also delete all the software that I do not need out of the computer, this make the computer to run lighter & faster. Few of the common mistakes computer users have are 1) not defrag. regularly 2) not clean-up disk regular 3) have a lot of software that does not need which cause a heavy load in the computer. If you could carry 50 lbs, why not do it instead of carrying 500 lbs. When the computer has many software inside which it does not need, it will run slower & slower. 4) ruffly handling the computer is a \"no, no\", your laptop is a sensitive & fragile electronic device, handle it very gently or you will pay the price for damaging it. I used cushion to sandwich between my laptop in the computer carry Targus bag. The cushion of computer bag does not have enough cushion to keep the computer from shock injury. 5) used the dust blower can to blast out the dirt every once & a while. I am in deployment right now & dust has got into my broadband portal, at first I thought something wrong with my computer why it did not connect. After blasting into the portal connection, the connection work again, no more problem since. At this time, you can get one on Ebay around 399.00 or less plus shipping, just continue to bid & look eventually you will find a nice one. Well, I hope my comment help & God blessed.","Date":"July 5, 2007"}

{"Title":"Not for music; poor customer service","Author":"Stixter \"Stixter\"","ReviewID":"R120JK3R4O3PGL","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought a Toshiba A105-S101 from Best Buy with an additional 256 MB of memory for $499 in Feb `06.  At the time I thought it was a steal.  In retrospect, I should have left it at the store.I bought this computer to use as a jukebox.  While it performs adequately at most tasks, the machine fails miserably as a sound reproducer - it induces a garbled distortion that one hears at the end of music and system sounds as well as in quiet musical passages.  Though Toshiba's tech support was professional and courteous, they were not able to fix the problem over the phone.  So far, I have had the system board replaced twice, and as I write, it sits at Toshiba's corporate office for \"evaluation\".  They have had it for two weeks and I have heard no news from them.  They never call back or answer e-mails.  I feel I have wasted $500 and a lot of time on the phone and shipping the thing in for repair.The three system boards (original and two replacements) have all displayed the same problem, so I can't help but conclude that it is a design problem with the model, not a problem with my machine.  Yes, I have good ears, and maybe some folks wouldn't ever notice the problem, but I have four Dell machines that sound great with the same music sources; the last thing I expected was that this new machine from a highly respected manufacturer would have such a fatal flaw.If you are planning to use this machine for music, test it first in the store with headphones before buying.Long story short, I gave Toshiba a chance to redeem itself through good customer service and they are failing at that, too.  Upset?  You bet!","Date":"August 1, 2006"}

{"Title":"Excellent Laptop","Author":"Darren He \"in Boston\"","ReviewID":"R2MEC7FNZ0SZ31","Overall":"good","Content":"The Thinkpad T series is IBM/Lenovo's standard business laptop, and as a college student, I have found it to be perfect. I have the T60 model with the specs listed above: T2500 (2GHz Core Duo), 1 GB Ram, 100 GB Hard Drive, SuperDrive, Bluetooth, Wireless Internet, Fingerprint Reader, Windows XP SP2, 128 MB ATI Radeon x1400. The laptop is very well constructed and sturdy. The keyboard is excellent, and very responsive. The screen is slightly dim, but I usually use it at an even dimmer setting anyways to conserve battery life. I also have a dock and a 21\" widescreen monitor. Recently, when my computer became infected, I merely used the backup sector (which takes away 20GB from your hard drive) to reload everything - it was a lot easier than manually reformatting, installing Windows, installing the thinkpad drivers, etc. The drivers are also very good, with the exception of the Thinkpad Access Connections, which I uninstalled immediately. The embedded security chip works well, if you need to use that. I prefer to key in a password rather than use a fingerprint reader. The fingerprint reader will not work if there is moisture of your fingertip. It also needs to be recalibrated (i.e. reprogram your fingerprint) every know and then. Since getting a dock though, I've chosen to forego the fingerprint reader completely.I purchased this thinkpad with the accidental damage protection warranty, which means I can do nearly anything to the thinkpad I want, and it will be replaced. Why would I though - it's a great computer.Battery life is pretty good - the 6 cell battery is rated at 3.5 hrs and will give you a decent 2.5. You can always upgrade to a 9 cell battery and/or take out the DVD-burner and stick in an extra battery there.Opening up the T60 is also easy, and allowable under the warranty to some extent - for example, adding RAM or replacing the keyboard (replacement keyboards are shipped overnight!)I also like the matte-ish finish off the laptop cover as well as the screen. All in all, a wonderful laptop, and with a student discount, very affordable. The newer Thinkpads have Core 2 Duo processors (marginal performance increase over the Core Duo in this laptop), and are Vista Ready. You can always upgrade. Highly recommended laptop.","Date":"December 12, 2006"}

Not sure if it has anything to do with IBM selling the business unit to Lenovo (Chinese company).Anyhow, this T60 feels a lot more \"plasticky\" than the T41.  It just seems cheap and flimsy.  I also have a lot of problems docking and undocking this machine.  With the T41, I can undock the machine, run to a conference room, open the laptop and not miss a beat.

Originally recommended to me by one of my fellow IT friends, I decided to check Amazon for the IBM ThinkPad T60. The price was right, I needed a laptop for email, office applications, and general sysadmin usage. The best part - these laptops are built like a TANK. Good luck breaking these on accident!Data Sales, Co. provided a great description of the laptop. All of the cosmetic wear was correctly described, leaving no surprises. The laptop was cleaned perfectly, packed perfectly, and even came with a copy of Windows XP (Although I just installed Arch Linux.) I ordered a separate battery for the laptop so I had that extra 4 hours of battery life. 8 hours of battery life for ~$150 is the deal of the century.My only issue is when you turn on, wake up, sleep, or take power in or out, the motherboard speaker makes a LOUD beep. This can be avoided by muting the motherboard speaker by pressing a button on the keyboard.The palm rests feel great, the screen looks great (although don't plan on taking this outside in broad daylight - unless you're in shade.) The hinge connecting the screen to the body of the laptop is very strong. You can hold the laptop by the screen and nothing will swing.This laptop can also be used for light gaming! I was shocked! I installed Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source on this laptop to find that both ran at upwards of 60fps and 20fps respectively when I tweaked with settings.All in all, this is a great buy.

Easy to replace an optical drive. Easy to replace a hard drive. Such a contrast with my old Apple G4 iBook, which I dearly love, which has a disk permanently stuck in a broken optical drive. The cost of replacing the optical drive on that machine would be more than the laptop is worth. The T60 keyboard is every bit as good as the g4 iBook keyboard. The light above the screen on the T60 to illuminate the keyboard is a very nice touch. The 4:3 aspect ratio screen is the best screen I've seen since my old Compaq Presario 1215US from 2001. One catch to warn about is the volume control on Windows 7 Pro. The Windows volume control gives you only the percentage of whatever volume is set by the volume buttons. I suggest setting the Windows volume control at 100% and then using only the thinkpad volume control buttons to set your volume. I was almost fooled by this glitch into thinking my T60 had defective speakers. It was a Microsoft problem! For Linux users, a Point Linux (Debian derivative with Mate Desktop) live DVD ran well on this machine with wireless working out-of-the-box.","Date":"April 11, 2014"}

{"Title":"If there were a negative star, I'd have clicked it","Author":"pdxpat","ReviewID":"R3G8NZVOQTU3W1","Overall":"bad","Content":"The mail tracking for this laptop went seriously wrong.  The seller emailed me to wait and it would sort itself out,When the thing finally arrived, it was filthy inside and outside.  A large sticky smear graced the lid.  Under every key there were long black hairs mashed together with dust and other unidentifiable debris.  The screen was almost opaque from the stuff on it.The T60 is known for being easily user serviceable.  It should have been trivial to reassemble this laptop into its original condition. When it arrived, the palmrest was loose all along its edges;  it had not even been refastened down correctly.Many of the keys had no face on them. This version of the T60 does not have easily replaceable keys and it shouldn't have needed to be done, anyway.  Anyone who is not a touch typist, even though most programmers are, could not easily use the keyboard.The laptop's memory was an unadvertised 512 megabytes.  This is gastropodial by today's standards. Added to this, the laptop would not even boot when the second gigabyte from my failed T60 was added - it would only take  one gigabyte card and one 515 megabyte card.The battery would not hold a minute's worth of charge.  When combined with the fact that the advertised power shortage was no power cord, this would have left a purchaser without a previous similar model without any source of power at all.The video card was so regressed Debian fainted and could not install Gnome.This seller has decided to sell laptops stripped of everything that can be resold and leave it up to the purchaser to find that out. I would not buy from them again.  I did not return this one because in the process of investigating its shortcomings I did change its original state, for example filthy to clean, fastening down the palmrest, etc. and do not want the additional annoyance of dealing with return postage and arguments  over original vs. returned condition.The one thing it did have as advertised, other than a functioning motherboard, working wireless and an irrelevant Windows installation, was the 120 gigabyte harddrive.","Date":"January 10, 2014"}

{"Title":"HP Compaq nc6400 Business Notebook (Refurbished)","Author":"808IsLaNDGiRL","ReviewID":"R7P9DVZLG5BSG","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been an Amazon customer for nearly a decade and haven't had any issues with Amazon or any sellers. With all of the items and thousands of dollars spent on this website, this is the very first \"review\" I am writing. I was very hesitant about purchasing this refurbished laptop. You don't really know what you are actually buying with transactions like these.I purchased my laptop from GothamCityMall. We received the package via USPS a day earlier than expected, was not expecting that! So I really didn't know what to expect when I opened the box. And boy was I surprised! After removing the various layers of bubble wrap and tape, I unwrapped a pretty cool-looking piece of machinery. It is definitely an old model, but it still looks just as sexy as the new guys out there on the market today. Also, the laptop may have been refurbished, but it looks far from used! Cosmetically, it was almost perfect except for one tiny scratch on the cover. The keyboard, screen, battery/cords were also in new condition. If I didn't know any better, I would think this machine was brand new. I really got lucky with this one!Before purchasing this refurbished laptop, we had the pleasuring of using a relative's brand new Inspiron Notebook for almost 2yrs. Although my nc6400 isn't quite as sleek in the looks department, it does pretty much everything that the Inspiron did. I'm pleasantly surprised!It handles multiple windows of web browsing, creates documents w/ease, plays Netflix videos (sound is great), and whatever else you can throw at it, all at the same time...without any problems with performance. The physical size and weight of this laptop is perfect! I hated lugging around the huge and incredibly heavy 15\" Inspiron. This thing is a baby in comparison! The layout of the keyboard and the feel of the keys is wonderful. I also like the matte screen compared to the high-gloss screen of the Inspiron. Fingerprints from my 2 1/2 year old are much less noticeable. My most favorite feature on the keyboard itself is the handy row of buttons at the top, volume included. The Inspiron didn't have volume buttons, making it quite an inconvenience to make adjustments.I'm not sure if I will be using this laptop to play games, but I'm sure it can handle it without a problem. We'll have to see though. I haven't watched DVD's or listened to music on it yet either, but I do love that I can burn DVD's or CD's as well. The 3 USB ports are handy; I'm only using about 2 at a time for my flash drive and wireless mouse. The smart/memory card slots are also handy for a family like ours that takes a lot of pictures.Because this machine was built for the office (I use it for Home), it has many features that I don't have the need for. They are great tools to have when and if I decide to use this machine in an office setting. The one \"office\" feature I do use is the Fingerprint Scanner. It's pretty cool and easy to set up.If you are debating between buying a new/newer laptop or even a used version of this laptop, stop fighting with yourself. It is risky buying used/refurbished electronics online, but it's a risk I'm so happy I decided to take. I spent less than $200 (shipping included) on a quality piece of machinery that does everything that I need it to do, and is comparable performance-wise, to the newer and MUCH MORE expensive laptops that are selling now.","Date":"February 29, 2012"}

It's just something that I would carry with me while traveling. It's small, lightweight, and it gets the job done.What I like about it:* The keyboard is normal size.* The touchpad works fine.* It has plenty of ports for connecting devices.* It's fast enough for me (surfing the web, checking email, OpenOffice, listen to music, watch movies, etc.)* The screen is large enough; it's bright and has good color* It includes a DVD/CD drive* It's reliable, good quality, and well made* Wireless card included (for Internet)I removed all non-essential software from it, including the \"fingerprint security detection\" software. This helps to keep it running fast.With adequate padding included, the notebook, cord, and charger fit nicely inside a USPS Priority Mail medium flat rate box (13-5/8\" x 11-7/8\" x 3-3/8\"). And that works great if you are giving it as a gift (like to a soldier who needs one to keep in touch with family/friends back home).Things to keep in mind if you are purchasing it used; verify that...* it comes with an operating system like Windows XP* the battery, charger, and cord are included* the battery still hold a charge (unless you just plan to plug it in when using it)* it has enough RAM memory for your needs* it is in working orderI'm pleased with my purchase and would buy one of these notebooks again, if needed.","Date":"October 24, 2013"}

I have had no issues beyond only one with this Lenovo (IBM) ThinkPad: it is a Centrino Due. A slower processor that I have not found to run hot, and it has not crashed either. All and all it is a good machine. The battery has lasted up 3.5 hours with normal use of MS office and desktop publishing. Not unexpected considering the age of which this computer came out. That also can be solved by purchasing any one of the many extended battery methods on the market. I do not use the Lenovo T60P to travel much away from home, I bought the Lenovo X41 for this and an extended battery that last me a good six hours of MS Office time (the X41 cannot handle desktop publishing but I don't require that when I am away from home--who does?). For me, whatever the subject, it has always been \"the right tool for the right job!\"Oh, one more thing if anyone is reading this, I am not a rich man, if I was I would have the latest and greatest computers, one for the road and one for home as now.

{"Title":"Awesome laptop for the price!","Author":"Whereeaglesnest","ReviewID":"R57IKEBZP713O","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned the 1.8 P4 version for 2 years and I am considering buying one just to have should anything happen to this one. Even by today's standards this is a very good laptop. The ONLY drawback is that there is only 1 USB port and it is 1.1 but that is very easily solved with a $15 PCMCIA card with USB 2.0 ports. This is not a \"gamer\" laptop but it is a serious workhorse that you can adapt in so many ways to your needs that you can't with most even today. For example, if you tend to need more battery time than the DVD drive (I upgraded my CD to a DVD burner) then just pop out the DVD and pop in an extra battery. Or like in my case I wanted more hard drive so I bought a 100 gig to replace the main hard drive and by doing a little surfing online I found a parts place that sells an enclosure for a second hard drive that fits perfectly into the DVD slot, so since I do not need the DVD very often I have another 100 gig drive in most of the time, how cool is that!? Add to that that it has S video out, vga out plus a keyboard port in case you prefer a regular keyboard when at home. The video is a respectable 32 meg ATI and I have run some games and applications that were not suppose to be able to run on it according to specs. This laptop only accepts 1 gig total memory but under XP that is fine and will keep you moving along smoothly. I ordered mine with the wireless networking card (802.11b but you can buy very cheaply a G card that will go right in to replace the B card or if yours doesn't come with a card you can add one VERY cheaply) and the speeds are so close to my G PCMCIA card that I use the B card built into mine with my G router.When you really look at just what your getting for a comparable price these days, for everything this one is capable of I cannot recommend grabbing one of these enough, it is sturdy, nice size screen (14.1) and just an overall feeling of confidence in this laptop because it \"feels\" durable. When these were brand new I'm told you could not by them as an individual as they were only meant for business purchasers.Bottom line: you want something worth the money this is it no question. Admittedly I put another $200 into mine but that was all upgrades to the memory and DVD and adding another hard drive. As it comes it is an awesome deal in today's market will run rings around many laptops in the same price range.In case you missed it through all the techie talk, buy this laptop!Dell Latitude C640 1.8 GHz Pentium 4 256MB/60GB/CD Drive Notebook Computer","Date":"December 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"Small, Powerful, and Light Weight","Author":"Damien Margo","ReviewID":"R3PPW4QU2IY87U","Overall":"good","Content":"Once again Toshiba re-defines the marketplace with this incredibly powerful lightweight laptop. How can you beat this? It's only around five pounds and packs incredible power at an amazing price. It's a great deal by the best laptop maker out there. The positives totally outweigh the negatives, but I will mention the few problems. The system makes more fan noise than most other models. If the system were more expensive this would be a deal breaker, but again, this powerful laptop is cheap! The other problem is how the system performs out of the box. As usual the system comes with a ton of pre-installed garbage. It took me 4-8 hours to wipe the hard drive, re-image it with a clean OS, and install the Toshiba drivers. Once this was complete the system worked to my satisfaction. This would be a five star review if the system worked well out of the box.

{"Title":"The BEST student laptop!","Author":"Andrea Horne \"WCU Student\"","ReviewID":"RDJR6J8VHGZUQ","Overall":"good","Content":"Being a college student, I am always looking for ways to save money.  After a semester of living without a laptop and constantly having to go over to the computer lab which was anything but conducive to studying and writing, I finally realized it was time to buy my own laptop.  With so many options on the market, I spent much of my winter vacation trying to figure out which model I would finally decide on.  The driving factor in my decision was price.  I knew that I wanted to spend under one-thousand bucks for the laptop and any needed accessories.  I called up my brother, the computer whiz, and asked for his opinion.  He told me to look into Toshiba, and that started my two week long search that ultimately led me to this laptop.I went to Best Buy, WalMart, Target, etc to test out many different models of many different laptops.  The first thing I noticed with this Toshiba is the screen.  For being only 14.1 inches, you barely notice that it is inferior in size to the bigger 17 inch models.  The colors are vivid, the pictures are as clear as can be, and while testing watching DVDs on it, I felt like I was watching High Def. TV.  I decided after that point to research the model farther, and eventually ended up buying it.I ordered my M115 from CompUSA and it arrived within two short days.  I opened the box and started set-up.  I was amazed at how few annoyances I had with a laptop that cost me so little.  Usually you are going to sacrifice SOMETHING if you're buying a cheaper product, no matter what that product may be.  Of course, as I delved deeper into testing this laptop, I figured out several reasons why it is in the budget category.Now that the laptop was home, it was time to start other tests.  I had already tested the screen at the store, and like I said, it passed with flying colors.  Next I tested the battery life.  I put in my extended version of \"The Return of the King\" and let the battery run down.  I kept the laptop at full brightness and did NOT use power saver mode.  It took two hours and fifty-five minutes before the laptop shut off.  This is EXCELLENT for a six-cell battery under the conditions I put it in.Next, I tested the laptop battery for word processing on the lowest brightness possible with power saver mode.  The battery was empty after four hours and five minutes.  I was extremely pleased with these results because I use this laptop for word processing in class where I can't charge it up if it runs out of battery, and over four hours is more than enough for me.  However, if you are truly concerned about battery life, you can always buy a spare and keep it charged.After the battery had taken a good beating from all the testing, I started testing sound quality.  I popped in my \"Best of the Classics\" CD and started messing around with the sound settings.  On lower settings, the sound quality is not the best.  However, the higher you put the volume, the better quality you will get from the speakers.  I finally found the perfect spot on the volume adjuster for listening to CDs.  However, I need to adjust when watching DVDs and Videos...generally you need to turn the volume up a bit for that.  All in all, I was happy with the speakers and sound quality, but not blown away.After taking my CD out, I started opening every application on the laptop.  This way, I could see approximately how many applications I could have open before the laptop either seized up or got horrendously slow.  I opened the internet, my word processor, photoshop, my digital photography suite that is connected to my printer, my website editor and finally, I started running the virus-scan.  This is a lot to ask of any computer, but especially of one that only runs on 512MB.  I found that it ran the applications well up until I opened the website editor.  It was just too much for the little M115 to handle.  This was expected from a machine that only runs on 512MB, and I decided at that point that an upgrade to 1GB would be needed.  I ordered another 512MB the next day, and can now run all the applications I want.  From time to time they will slow up a bit, but the fact that it can even handle that work load is awesome and a definite must, since I'm a multi-tasker.This laptop comes with an 80GB HD, and some today say the new standard is at least 100GB.  To be honest, I think that's a complete crock of sh**.  I have an old Compaq (from 1999) that still works, and it has a 15GB HD, with only 11GB usable.  If I can operate that machine (and I can), then 80GB is luxury.  I have all the programs I need installed on this machine and I still have 55GB free.  Will I use it?  Probably not.  Would I need 100GB?  No way!  Unless you are someone who is using cr**loads of programs that require installation on the computer, then there is NO need for anything bigger than 80GB while operating on a Windows XP machine.  Maybe when it's time to upgrade to Vista, but for now, it is just not necessary.  Besides, you will not be upgrading to Vista on this laptop.  I know several Microsoft developers and they all have Vista already...and some of them can't even run it on machines with 100GB HDs and 2GB memory.  So yeah, stick with XP and you will be fine with 80GB HD and 1GB memory (RAM).One annoyance I had after setting up this laptop is finding the amount of bloatware that came with it.  It can be easily removed, but the fact that so much of it was even on my little M115 was a serious gripe for me.  This is probably one of the reasons why it was so cheap--lots of manufacturers being advertised from start-up.  I now have altered it to my liking, but it takes some time and patience.Another thing to keep in mind is that this laptop is not for extreme gamers.  I do a lot of graphic design with digital photography and I can work from this laptop, but it isn't the best home-base for my work.  This is more of a laptop that you would use for typical programs like the internet, word-processing, light gaming, light photo-editing, movie-watching, music listening and chatting.  It's great for the TYPICAL user...but don't buy this laptop and then complain that you can't run your huge graphic-demanding games on it without giving up some quality...if you're in that boat, you should go with an Alienware.Some annoyances that have been listed with this laptop, other than battery life which I have already covered, are the keyboard and some complaints of overheating or loud fan noise.  The keyboard is cramped.  No two ways about it.  This is a small laptop, and the keyboard is spread nicely on it, but it is still cramped.  I have small hands so this is not a problem, but a someone with huge piano fingers would probably have a hard time with typing.  A very hard time.  Test the laptop out at a store before buying it, because if you don't you could be sorely disappointed.  I did not notice ANY overheating...it gets warm, but in no way does it \"overheat.\"  There is some fan noise, but very little.  It turns on every 5-10 minutes for about two seconds when using the laptop under normal use.My last note on this laptop is that I wish it had come with a faster processor.  I have altered it so that it is up to what I want as far as performance goes, but come on, Intel Core 2 Duo is the standard now.  Not Intel Core Duo.  Hopefully Toshiba will change this on future M115 models, because I would love to get a younger sibling of this laptop at some point.For what I paid, I could not have gotten better.  This laptop gets the job done and is the best of the best in budget laptops.  Buy another 512MB of RAM, and you will be good to go.RATINGS:Screen Quality: 10/10Sound Quality: 7/10Operation Speed: 8/10 (after upgrade) or 6.5/10 (before upgrade)Battery life: 7.5/10 (excellent for a six-cell battery!!!)Out-of-box quality: 6/10Price: 10/10Design: 8/10Why not 10/10?Screen Qualiy deductions: -0.

The size is nice, with the LCD wide screen making it very enjoyable to watch movies on.  It's a pretty light laptop, at 5.something pounds and is very mobile for its size.  I really like the keyboard, with the regular sized 'Shift' button on the right hand side.  The battery life can last up to (and possibly a little over) 4 hours, depending on your chosen power settings.  It's got the built-in wireless card, that you can switch on and off whenever you want to use it.  The graphics for this computer are pretty good, and pretty much everything else is well over satisfactory.The only cons about this computer is the 512mb memory, but that can easily be upgraded, and all you need is another 512mb memory upgrade and you're set.  Also, the computer comes with a lot of unnecessary software and junk, but that problem can be solved by simply uninstalling whatever you don't want on there.  It can take a bit of time, though, depending on how much stuff you want to uninstall, but I didn't really mind it.Overall, I'd have to say this is a great laptop at a great price.","Date":"December 23, 2006"}

{"Title":"It was an OK computer before I broke it!","Author":"GNN Photography \"GNN\"","ReviewID":"R2WXSL9S2C6S4T","Overall":"good","Content":"Ok so my review will focus on how the laptop preformed before I broke the screen. To start out the laptop worked fine for basic activities like surfing the web, looking at pictures, or listening to your music library. But with the entry level amount of ram, and the cpu only being a single core, it lags with basic games like Sim City, and The Sims, and forget graphic intensive games like Flight Simulator's. It always got hot when doing basic stuff, thus the fan kicks into overtime to cool it down causing noticeable noise. The screen (before I cracked it)was very hazy, and the glare in the sun was terrible. Now moving on from the bad, the good things included a roomy keyboard with a very nicely located shift key (its great for fast typing). The battery was good with a two hour life span maybe two and a half if you're doing the basics. It came pre installed with a lot of useful software, that was a plus. All in all it fit my basic needs, but its limited hardware can set you back. I suggest a ram upgrade before you even set foot into the level of games, and streaming movies from Netflix, or Hulu.","Date":"May 23, 2012"}

{"Title":"Fantastic laptop","Author":"Guy in Fredericksburg, VA","ReviewID":"R38B20LPI092Z1","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great laptop.  First, let me say, I'm a software developer, so I'm very particular about my computers.  I was in the market for a new laptop.  After a lot of shopping around, I went with a laptop from HP for around $700.  It was my first PC with Vista, and it was frustratingly slow.  Here's an example... Put your laptop into sleep mode.  Come out of sleep mode, and how long does it take to connect to your WiFi network?  The HP laptop would take about 45 seconds while the macbook takes less than 5 seconds.  It's a small detail, but it's the tip of the iceberg.So, after I purchased my HP laptop, my wife bought a macbook.  I was so impressed, I took mine back and got my own macbook.  The battery is great.  I haven't timed it yet, but it's easily over three hours.  The LCD is great.  You don't get all that bloatware that comes with a new PC (like antivirus software that you can't seem to delete) that fills up your new hard disk.  And, there's no need to even worry about antivirus software since 99.9% of viruses are designed for Windows.As for performance, these macbooks are plenty zippy.  And, yes dual core does make a difference.  If you like to multitask (browse the web while playing mp3 music), then you'll notice the difference.  The user interface is more responsive during heavy loading.  Just for fun, I took a program I wrote for work and ran it on my new macbook.  (I won't bore you with the details of what it does, but it's CPU intensive.)  On the HP laptop, the program took about 13 minutes to run.  On the macbook, it took 3 min, 30 seconds.  Just for fun, I ran the same program on a fully loaded Dell 820 ($3000), and it finished in about 3 minutes.  So, I'm very pleased with the performance of this macbook.And, there are great open source (free) applications you can get for Mac OS X now.  So, I quickly installed Firefox, Thunderbird (email), NeoOffice (MS Office replacement), Chicken of the Sea (VNC client), XAMPP (Apache/PHP/MySQL), Transmission (BitTorrent), Burn (CD/DVD burner), and Eclipse (Java development).The only way they could improve this macbook would be to bundle the DVD writer in the entry-level model instead of a combo drive (CD writer, DVD reader).  It's not an issue with me since I have many other DVD writers on my LAN, but others may want to purchase the next model up that comes with the DVD writer.","Date":"August 30, 2007"}

{"Title":"If it's been two years, this one is worth the plunge.--UPDATE. (Extend the warranty)","Author":"Samuel Chell","ReviewID":"R821ZWCA6TXB4","Overall":"good","Content":"[UPDATE: Written 18 months after the review below: Compared to my iBook this machine proved better built (on the outside), maintained a tighter-action keyboard, was noticeably faster--for 15 months, at which point the hard drive simply, suddenly, and unexpectedly, died.]  It's predecessor, the iBook, on the other hand, developed problems like letters disappearing from the keys of the keyboard along with the keyboard action becoming sloppy, loose, and chattery.  I'd rather replace a keyboard than a hard-drive any day, but I probably got my money's worth out of both machines (Apple's least expensive models).  If I had to do it again, I'd order the extended warranty plan with any Apple laptop.  It's expensive, and it's not guarantee (if Apple judges the damage due to the user's incorrect or inappropriate use of the machine), but if it's a laptop and it sees heavy use, the two extra years are probably worth the several hundred extra. (With desktop models I'm still inclined not to buy the extended warranty.)}I ordered my last small-screen iBook from Amazon just two summers ago.  As usual, my heavy touch started shorting out the keyboard, and I couldn't afford several weeks of down time.  Factor in the wait, the cost of repairs, and the improvements, and this 13\" MacBook from Amazon seemed the best way to go.It's about a hundred bucks more than the prior edition but worth it.  The screen is wider, sharper and brighter (though I had no complaints with the predecessor).  The speed of unloading internet pages is noticeably faster,  a time-saver. The magnetically attached power cord should save the user the cost of an Apple adapter or two (about $80 each time you snap the thin wire).  The keyboard area is larger, which is nice, though the different feel of the tracking area and right thumb-click (little play--it barely seems to go down) takes a bit of getting used to.I didn't need a built-in camera or remote control, but what can you do.  At least I was able to avoid the Superdrive (haven't found much use for DVD burning) and all the extras (and sales tax) they push if you buy from Apple Store.  This machine doesn't require any additional memory or RAM, unless you're a heavy duty movie editor/audio engineer.  It's a one-click purchase. I even took a pass on Apple's current iPod incentive (I still buy CDs, mostly from Amazon).Even as I type this review, I'm conscious that the keyboard has a tighter feel and is quieter than the previous model. It also gets around in the often cumbersome and sluggish MS Word more quickly than the comparable machine of only two years ago. A great little work horse, and the transfer of information from your old computer has never been easier (make sure you have a firewire cable handy).","Date":"July 24, 2007"}
{"Title":"Fast and Zippy","Author":"Andy \"Andy\"","ReviewID":"R3KFBUPAMQRE3Y","Overall":"good","Content":"I will try to give a unbiased and responsible review of this MacBook. As a college student I struggled with the decision between purchasing a Windows laptop or a MacBook, but due to all the horror stories out there about Vista imcompatibility and my previous Windows nightmares, I decided to give Mac a try. I don't regret it. The screen is glossy and beautiful, albeit the 13.3\" screen can make the font in programs (especially in instant messaging programs) a bit small. You can adjust the font to larger size in, say,  AIM, but then that would render the person you are talking to to receive ridiculously large font sizes from you as well. And, if you are new to MAC OSX, there is definitely a learning curve and an experimental phase, so you should be patient; fortunately, there are alot of MAC OSX tutorial sites on the web and resources as well. I love the fast fast FAST boot time (around 20 seconds!!!) from off to on. BRAVO!! And the 2.0 ghz processor is more than enough for me. The MacBook is also very very silent. One thing I don't like though is the mouse track pad. Even on the fastest sensitivity setting, it just doesn't keep up with my fingers. A bit annoying, but a problem that can be solved with an external USB mouse. Let's see how my MacBook holds up in the next four years.","Date":"May 25, 2007"}

Recent issues with Vista and increasing problems with run-time bloat, incredibly long startup times, malware, and endless updates with their associated mandatory and automatic reboots began to get me thinking about checking out the Mac again.  Particularly with my iPod and iPhone showing me how superior Apple products could be compared to the competition.So I bit the bullet and purchased my first Macintosh laptop, the new MacBook with glossy screen, dual core Intel processor, and a gig of RAM.  For the most part, the laptop has been a pure joy to use, is built with amazing solidity, and does what it's advertised to do.  However, since I use computers of all kinds all day, I have racked up a number of pros and cons for this mostly stellar new laptop product as I've used this MacBook (in gorgeous matte executive black) the last three weeks on a daily basis.PROS:- Amazingly fast boot time, about 20-30 seconds in my tests. Wayyy better than Windows.- Extremely solid construction and feel.- Elegant and compact power cord setup with the famous magnetic detach system to prevent annoying and damaging cord yanks.- Comes with lots of software and apps that really work.- Roomy storage and good overall performance.- Does not run too hot, even when performance settings are turned up.- Supports Bluetooth 2.0 and a lot of the newer, sexier Bluetooth profiles including A2DP and stereo headsets.- Big, bright, clear screen.- The built-in camera takes decent video and it works well with Skype.- With Parallels, runs Windows Vista Ultimate flawlessly so far, even with old apps, simultaneously with the Mac OS.- The feel of the latest Mac desktop seems brawny yet nimble with lots of seductive graphics, morphing windows, flip screens and more.  Makes it a joy visually.- Battery life is acceptable, not finding myself wanting a lot more juice frequently (though occasionally I do.)- Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection works surprisingly well to control and use Windows PC's remotely, a genuine pleasure since I usually work with 2-4 computers at a time, and I can just Alt-Tab between them from the MacBook.CONS:- User interaction often seems weirdly sluggish with a brief, unexplained pause when many common actions are initiated in applications.  Not significantly off putting, but strange for a system with two powerful CPU cores.- WiFi seems slow and inconsistent.  Not a lot of dropped connections, but slower for sure than my PC laptops.- Bluetooth stereo support is crude, with no automatic switching between internal and wireless speakers/mics.- The leading Mac apps (iLife, iWork, Mac Office) just aren't as stable as their Windows counterparts.  Not a lot less stable, but definitely noticeable and sometimes frustrating.- The trackpad and associated button feels heavy and ponderous and is tedious to use for long periods.  Definitely invest in the wireless Mac mouse for serious work, it works well.- Irritating sharp beveled edge on front of the case where your wrists rest.  All edges on the MacBook are smooth except for the one which you rest your wrists.  Careful placement and angling of MacBook can help, but seems inexplicable in terms of good design.- Screen has slightly uneven lighting, not enough to bother but Sony laptops run rings around the MacBook in terms of mind-blowing clarity and lighting consistency.- No extended battery available from Apple (that I know of), not good for serious business users.- No built-in WWAN support, had to buy something from Verizon that hangs off the side, another knock on business use of this product.- 1 GB RAM is not enough for serious daily use, I had to upgrade to 2GB to get things to work right, particularly with Parallels.For lighter family use, the current MacBook is more than ready for almost any computing task.  For serious business use, the MacBook is just barely there and requires some additional investment (mouse, WWAN, extra battery, Parallels) but that's true of many Windows laptops as well.One star is subtracted from a perfect score for the strange design shortfalls (average Bluetooth support, sharp edge on the front of the case, so-so trackpad, less than great app stability, less than zippy response of apps.)I would recommend this product to almost anyone however, the Macintosh has re-arrived on the personal computing scene for sure.  I hope you enjoy it!","Date":"August 21, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great for everything.... but not for spreadsheets","Author":"CKE","ReviewID":"R1RMLEFQFG4F0G","Overall":"good","Content":"I guess all Apple reviews eventually become a comparison between PCs and Windows to the virtues of Macs.  Most of us really only have these two options.... we can look at RAM, memory, processor speed and a variety of other indicators - but to be honest what characteristics really matters? Hopefully, this review can help make this as painless as possible for the non-tech savvy (The power users already have their preferences). By the way, I use both PCs and Macs during the course of the day, so I will give my opinion on the strengths and weaknesses.Apple - Strengths-  The Apple goes from \"off\" to \"surfing the internet\" in 15 seconds. It is truly amazing how fast it gets booted-up and ready to run.-  Video editing is a breeze - lots of power here.- Lack of viruses ...there are some... but not nearly as many as Windows based computers...an added benefit is that you don't have use \"Norton\" or \"McAfee\" and all of the annoying pop-ups that those programs provide.- Ichat... my wife is able to have a picture perfect video conference with her sister every night...even though they live 2500 miles a part. The best part? It is free!- Apple support is top-notch! You make an appointment at a store and they bend over backwards to help you! This is sooo much better than calling into some random help desk.- Quality of construction - sorry, I have had to many PCs die from hardware related issues over the last 5 years... Apple's seem to last forever.Apple - Weaknesses-Spreadsheets - It is true you can get a Mac version of Excel - but it is absolutely horrible. Things that you take for granted on Windows based Excel...i.e adding a comment in a cell are missing!- You can not buy (at least at the time of this review) music and videos on Amazon.com - they do not support Macs at this time.- Lack of programs in general. While there are many cool programs and games for PCs there are only a handful available for the Mac.- Attaching photos to email is not as easy as using a PC and Yahoo.- a 13.3\" monitor really is too small.My final recommendation? If you have to have ONE computer you probably want to strongly consider a PC. The  variety of programs and the power of spreadsheets have become critical to most of us.... especially for our jobs. However, if you need a computer simply for \"fun\" (not counting games) and surfing the internet the Apple is impossible to beat.If you need a computer for work or Video Games = PC/windowsIf you need a compuer for surfing the internet/photos/videos = Apple/MacOS","Date":"September 14, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great little notebook","Author":"Chones","ReviewID":"RYU88B7LP26H7","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my Macbook (MB) for about two weeks now and I have to say I love it, and I'll tell you why:1) Ease of use.  After you get over the PC to Mac unfamiliarity (it took me a day or so), you'll realize that everything on this MB is so much more user friendly than any PC/Notebook I've ever used.  For example, deleting items/programs off the computer.  There is no need to uninstall...just drag the item to the trash and bingo, the program is gone.  There is no registry in OS X to deal with.  Wireless connectivity is a breeze - just walk into a hotspot and a little window pops up asking if you want to connect.  That simple!  My previous laptop - Dell Insipiron - took some windows configuration which if you're new to wireless connectivity could take awhile to get used to.  Bluetooth comes standard and any device is automatically detected.  I have a BT mouse that I just turned on and the MB took care of the rest.  It was that easy -- so far I haven't had to deal with drivers and updating and the like.2. Security -- I am still a litle wary about this aspect of the MB, but no anti-virus software!  I have not yet (knock on wood) encountered any spyware/viruses whereas in PC, that is the first thing you have to contend with.  That is not to say Macs are not vunerable, but much less so than PCs from what I've read.3. It is sleek, light, and great looking.  Aesthetics aren't too important to me, but it is a plus.  The MB looks great and works well.  Not to mention its 1\" all around size.  It is slightly heavy, a little over 5lbs with the adapter.  Fits nicely in my school bag -- not much heavier than a 5 star notebook with about the same dimensions.4. Little things.  So you can probably get more functionality/customizibality from a Dell for at or just under the price of this MB.  But what the Dell probably won't offer is the little things. For example, the AC adapter comes in two parts - one much like the IPod adapter with two prongs for travel and then a three pronged extension when using at home.  The fast connectivity of this MB - I never have to turn it off/restart, I just close the lid and the its goes to sleep.  When I open the lid, the computer starts right up and picks up where I left off in seconds.  On that note, the use of magnets for the lid closure and power cord connector -- that is ingenious!  No latch to break, no hard cable connection to send your MB flying from the careless, unaware college kid. Installing applications -- just download app, an icon appears on your desktop, drag it to your applications folder and you are done.  There are many more little things that I could mention, but this review is turning out too long as it is.Bottom line:  I am very happy with this MB.  It is my first Apple Computer, and when my Dell XPS dies, I intend on replacing it with an Apple PC.  They just seem so much more user friendly.  I am not a computer whiz and the Mac seems to target the average user like me.  I love every aspect about this MB from the size, weight, design, to its functionality.  Switching from PC to MAC is really not that difficult and if you get stuck, just google whatever it is you need and someone somewhere has probably had the same question.  Most of the stuff is common sense.  Unlike some other users, I don't think the MB gets overly hot on my lap after many hours of usage.  The keyboard is flat and takes a bit of getting used to, but I love it.All in all, well worth the price.  I bought mine off the Apple store, used the student discount ($100 off), got a free IPOD.  Granted you cannot upgrade much on this machine (I got a larger HDD), so it won't replace a regular computer for gaming or serious graphic design.  If you want more value for your money - you're probably better off with something like a Dell.  But if you have the money (although it's not overpriced for compared to other notebooks in its class), and want a well thought out, nicely built machine - with very little headaches that are associated with PCs, you should get this MB.  You won't be disappointed!","Date":"August 24, 2007"}

Enger","ReviewID":"R306JBUNG4N4TA","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been a Mac gal for 20 years now, although I have to use a PC at work (but it can't hurt to know both platforms, right?). This is my second Mac laptop, replacing an original iBook from 1999, which is still working fine but can't accommodate enough RAM for OS X and things like Photoshop. The MacBook is lighter, boots up in record time (faster than the iBook and my work PC), and I love the glossy screen. OK, I do sort of miss the handle--no matter what people said about the iBook, that handle is helpful when you live in a house full of butterfingers.No complaints about battery life--I keep AirPort turned off when I'm not online--and I work in some pretty battery-draining programs, like iMovie, InDesign, and Photoshop. The MacBook handles them all with ease, and the big hard drive means I can keep multiple projects onboard and still have plenty of working room.Love Spotlight (the search widget) and Dashboard--my inner Steve Jobs really hates all sorts of aliases cluttering up my desktop and impinging on my wallpaper. Dashboard has a calculator and a dictionary/thesaurus for my son, and boatloads of free widgets are available at apple.com for the publishing geek (font management, project timers, etc.)Being somewhat new to OS X and using Windows XP at work, I wasn't sure how Tiger would handle cross-platform files, but I've imported wav and avi files and iTunes and iMovie read them without needing additional software for translation. If I want Windows on the MacBook, I can use BootCamp to have it run native, which would be a vast improvement over the adequate-but-slow PC emulation I had on the iBook under Virtual PC. Because I'd only need Windows to run spreadsheet software for hubby, I'm hoping iWork07 has the long-awaited spreadsheet program.Hooking the MacBook up to my ancient peripherals was a snap. Drivers for my 8-year-old inkjet printer were native to OS 10.4, and I was able to download free OS X drivers for my 8-year-old scanner and 15-year-old laserprinter.I'm very happy with my MacBook.

{"Title":"Snappy, \"relatively\" reasonably priced laptop","Author":"Amazonian","ReviewID":"R1GTBG888D40EZ","Overall":"good","Content":"While windows laptops bottom out at less than $500, price reductions have nudged this machine generally under the $1000 mark, and this particular model comes close. And it's probably a very reasonable amount, considering the features. What mates this model different?- If you've done the full installation, you can use both windows and Mac US, doubling the of applications available to you.- The speed is very fast for most applications, and standard use will provide a near-instantaneous use.And there are a few things that you may want to know before buying:- For demanding streaming video like Stage 6, you will need to upgrade the RAM from 1 to 2 gigs. Extra modules are available for under $50, and installation is remarkabably easy. Two gigs is your limit  for total RAM.- Heat is an issue for a number of users; certainly a cooler system increases wear. But at default, this model can be quite warm. That, too, isn't a major concern. The freeware smcfancontrol can bring the temperature to under 100ºF without significant fan noise.- Previous versions of Mac portables have been less than impressive from the standpoint of graphics quality. Ib this 13\" model, however, color is bright and and has very good detail. However, if you reduce brightness through the Control Panel, the image quality is close to a desktop system, and watching DVD movies is a pleasure.- This model has a battery life of well over four hours, though I try not to use the plug unless necessary. Save the battery entirely by uninstalling the battery.These tips help make this Macbook a special pleasure to use.","Date":"July 20, 2007"}

I was really debating on whether or not to buy this or stick with Windows. So I dediced to see if I could find a Windows based laptop with the same specs around the same pice. Not even refurbished laptops offers as much as this laptop ( Intel Duo Core processor 2.16, 1 Gig RAM, 120 Hard Drive). Don't believe me? Research it .

Long \"la la la\"","ReviewID":"R1PJUTZWBQDMTN","Overall":"good","Content":"This review is intended for current PC users who is thinking about getting a MacBook. I'll just point out some of the issues I have faced.I have been a PC user for 7 years. I'm using this MacBook for my college, and I have been using it for only a month.(Please be gentle, I will update my review later if anything changes)First thing that really bothers me is the battery life. I travel quite often, so battery life is a big deal to me. This MacBook claimed to have up to 6 hours of battery life, which is a lie!. In real life, it only last around 3 hours. Even I turned off bluetooth, wireless, dim the the screen, I might be lucky to get around 3.5 hours. If you run Macbook under Windows mode, the battery life drop to 2.5 hours. The only way you can get your macbook run for up to 6 hours is dimming your screen to darkest, not running any applications, and turning off wireless & bluetooth..Don't believe me? Go to different forums and search battery topics. My last laptop claimed to have up to 5 hours of battery life, which it did last around 4--5 hours even after 2 years.  If your previous laptop only have 1 or 2 hours of battery life, I guess 3 hours will be a little bit \"upgrade\" for you. On top of the short battery life, this macbook battery can get very hot, you can burn your lap if you put it there long enough.There are good things about Macbook. It is very easy to upgrade and install the memories. It only cost me around $60 to upgrade to 2GB ram, and I installed it very easily without much of an effort. The same configuration, Sony could easily cost around $2000, and macbook only cost $1300.I have always wanted a MacBook, because it is cute and stylish, but the Mac OS system always make me hesitated. I finally got it after I found out it also run windows now. It is very easy to install windows on MacBook with bootcamp. They suggest you to print out the instructions, which is not necessary, all you need to do is follow the instructions on screen.If you get used to using windows softwares, you will find many of them have very limited functions when under Mac OS, and sometimes they don't even have Mac version.The bootcamp I used was 1.3, it does have some incompatibility issues.The volume and brightness control keys, disk eject keys are not working under windows. I hope all these problems will be fixed in the future. Since there is no right click button, you have to use two fingers tap on the touch pad and click as right click. Some new MacBook users might have problems in the beginning.It is not hard to learn the Mac OS, and there are many great programs are specially designed for Mac. The office 2004 for Mac is great for college student, one of the function is you can record the lecture while you are typing down the notes.I strongly recommend this laptop. It works just like a regular laptop, but it can run in both of the world. :-PPS: the white macbook does get dirty easily, get Glass Plus Wipes, it will do the trick to make your laptop look new again.

First of all, the Superdrive is absoulutely necessary if you wanna back up your hard disk or big files... it's a little slow and bored to burn a lot of CD's with 700 MB, instead of a big DVD with 4,7 GB of capacity.2. The Intel-Based system is very fast, have a extremely quick start, and native software runs perfectly.3. The Intel Core 2 Duo is better than his first version. The Core 2 Duo, works colder, and doesn't have problems of unexpected shutdown. Very solid.4. The space in gigabytes of Apple software and applications it's simply a hassle, that's why I buyed this computer with a 80 GB hard disk, and when you open your laptop the first time, you can check with horrour only 56 GB available!! That's because you can see a lot of unnecessary Apple software that uses a total of 17 GB of your precious hard disk space. The solution? I re-installed Mac OSX from the DVD, erasing the whole hard disk, and simply I \"personalized\" what software I really need to use, so, I unchecked all the unecessary language packs, printer for all drivers, garage band, and some useless software, and finally, I get a lovable 3,5 GB Mac OSX and a 70 GB free... perfect.5. Mag-safe technology, simply comfortable.6. The 13\" with 1280 x 800 resolution, it's very bright, clear and you can \"see\" everything.I recommend this computer for people who wants an easy-to-use system, and enjoy it without thinking in virus, patches and worms like another operating systems.","Date":"July 26, 2007"}

I did not have any problems setting the computer up.  It does everything for you.  The MacBook is light, easy to carry and very functional.  I use it to edit my photos, check and compose my email, and video conference with my family from various locations around the house or when I am in the field shooting Pics.  It's easy to carry and use in the field for photography and down loading your images.  The AC adaptor is ingenious and helps in preventing injury to this computer. I like the black model but settled for the white because it doesn't show finger printsor smudges easily. The screen and the screen colors are clear &  beautiful but if you are farsighted get a larger screen.  The  glare on the glossy screen has been reported to be a problem however I haven't had any viewing problems.

The included softwear like Garage Band,  iDVD, iphoto and all the rest of the included softwear works seamlessly together and is astounding to say the least.  It is a fine instrument compared to other portable (PC's) in this price range and it can be used as a PC if you so desire.  Battery life is okay.

{"Title":"MacBook - Info on CD drive","Author":"Amaz Trend","ReviewID":"R39GB6GPDHZSYC","Overall":"good","Content":"I resubmitted a correction to Amazon for the drive speed of the CD (they have it as 6x and it is much faster) listed under the Apple laptop (ASIN: B000L48Z02), because I bought the computer and ran my own test.  It wrote at 3.4 MB/s instead of the 3.6 MB/s (which is 24x) so that is close enough.  I assume the top speed is under \"ideal conditions\" anyway and my hard drive was 3/4 full.  6x is more like 0.9 MB/s.  The manufacturer specs do say that the DVD read speed is 8x (from Apple:  Slot-loading Combo drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW): reads DVDs at up to 8x speed, writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed, writes CD-RW discs at up to 16x speed, reads CDs at up to 24x speed)Since Apple tends to give only a few options, and I can't find a single example anywhere of a 6x version, I assume that Amazon is wrong on the title.  In all fairness, since I did not check the speed of the DVD, a real world measurement might make that close to a 6x, but that is not the common way to rate the drive speed and I doubt Amazon did such a test and decided to publish only the precise values for the DVD.So far, for the few days I have it, the computer is great.  I like it as much or in some ways better than my work MacBook Pro 15\".  Running Windows is frankly distasteful, and you easily see why I stick to the mac side as much as possible, but Parallels makes it as easy and stable as it can be. This MacBook ran it with no noticeable speed difference. I love the no-latch closure in the front (much easier to open).  The built-in camera is very helpful and kids think that the funny software it comes with is a blast.  My bluetooth mouse was found with no trouble.I need to get use to the ports all being on the left side and the CD on the right compared to the MacBook Pro.  Also it feels about as heavy but is noticeably smaller when carrying it around.  The sound is as loud and clear as the MacBook, yet the speakers are not visible. My only complaint is the modem is not internal and is a $50 extra. That comm method may be on the way out in the long run, but it was a big mistake in my mind by Apple.  I still have an old external USB floppy drive that works with the machine.  Now that is backwards compatibility!Update: After having it for 7 months, I have to report that it is absolutely wonderful and my wife, who does not like computers, finds it very useful and easy to use.","Date":"June 8, 2007"}
{"Title":"Mac's Rule","Author":"JH","ReviewID":"R8WLZ605DI7OI","Overall":"good","Content":"The last time I used an Apple computer was in the early 1980's with an Apple II.  Things have come a long way since then but my computer experience since has always been with Windows PC's.  I looked at Macs and their users as rebels, outsiders who wanted to be different, away from the mainstream with little understanding of what makes someone want purchase a Mac.  Setting out to purchase my 1st notebook for home use, it seemed an almost impossible project with so many choices in the PC world.  Reading the reviews and shopping in the electronics superstores only made it worse.  Then I spent a few minutes with a Macbook.  \"Hey this software is pretty neat, the design is solid and well thought out, and I can actually have both operating systems on the same computer if I want....this is it!\"  Having used my new Macbook for only four days I am a now a believer.  Using a Mac computer is actually FUN and not BORING & frustrating like a Windows PC.  I will never go back to a Windows PC for home use.  Infact, I plan to look at the new iMac to replace my old desktop.  I am very happy with my purchase.","Date":"September 3, 2007"}
{"Title":"Excellent Notebook","Author":"N. Mainthia","ReviewID":"R2HQYBWILC3LPL","Overall":"good","Content":"I was a windows user for several years before purchasing this notebook.  After experiencing a lot of problems with some previous windows notebook, i decided to give Mac OS a try and was thoroughly satisfied.  The operating system is easy, hassle free, and efficient with multiple tasks. Furthermore a lot of the programs i found easy to use and very intuitive. The notebook itself is very well made compared to a lot of the flimsy lap tops i've seen on the market.  It's very lightweight and yet is a computing powerhouse with a Core 2 Duo processor running at 2.16 GHz and a 160 gb HD, to store just about whatever you want.  If you are having hassles with windows or are thinking of switching over I would highly reccomend this notebook.  I can consider this the best notebook I have ever owned.","Date":"June 26, 2007"}
{"Title":"MacBook MB062LL/A","Author":"RamenNoodle \"RamenNoodle\"","ReviewID":"R1CUVLMA30JT3L","Overall":"good","Content":"The newest revision to the Apple MacBook mid-range model is a solid buy and a decently equipped machine.  Amazon delivered a zero-defect machine to me within the promised 2-day shipping deadline for a very reasonable price, which is par for the course with Amazon in my experience.  The rebate program makes this about the lowest cost for these machines on the web  (you can currently get a $75 mail-in rebate from MacMall on this machine plus some 'extras', but for me the ease of the on-line Amazon rebate and the decent customer service they provide in case of a problem outweighed the few extra incentives from the MacMall folks).The machine itself comes with all you need to get going, but a ram upgrade will definitely boost the performance, particularly if you are running Parallels or VMWare to use Windows in a virtual machine configuration.  For those of you who may be considering a purchase directly from Apple in order to customize your system configuration, take a careful look at the cost of purchasing extra RAM or HD upgrades from a third party and installing the hardware youself.  You'll most likely receive your machine faster, both RAM and HD upgrades on this machine are 5-10 minute jobs, and the cost-savings over a custom configuration from Apple is substantial.  The only caveat being that any damage you cause to your system performing RAM or HD upgrades is not covered by the Apple warranty.Choosing the base model (2.0 Ghz. Combo Drive) vs. this model (2.16 Ghz. Superdrive) was for me the most difficult decision to make.  The extra Mhz. that the 2.16 Ghz. processor delivers is essentially unnoticeable in real-world performance.  So the primary consideration seems to be, is the DVD burning capability worth the extra $200?  The Combo drive can be upgraded by some 3rd party companies, but unlike the RAM or HD is NOT an easy job.  For me the extra cost was worth it for the occasional need to burn large files to DVD when away from my primary machine, YMMV.As with all laptops, these machines are more prone to failure than the desktop hardware, and will be more costly to fix should they break, so I would highly recommend purchasing Applecare for this product for the additional 2 years of hardware warranty it provides.","Date":"June 25, 2007"}
{"Title":"LOVE IT!","Author":"B. McEwan \"yellokat\"","ReviewID":"RMC01ZUWRTUMB","Overall":"good","Content":"I just adore this laptop!  I am a recent convert to Mac and treated myself to the 17 inch MacBook Pro when I first opened my small business earlier this year.  I liked it a lot so bought myself this small 13 inch to use at home and to carry on business trips.Well, I soon found myself completely attached to this smaller machine.  It is lightweight and has a battery that lasts an impressively long time. I can carry it anywhere and be set up to go in a flash, wherever there is a wireless connection.  And the speed of the wireless is terrific!  I also purchased an Airport Extreme and am now running my home network through its new, faster n standard.I have an old digital camera that was a huge hassle to use with Windows.  I had to download software and there were always glitches when I tried to upload photos from the camera card.  Now, with the MacBook's iPhoto, no software is necessary.  I just plug the camera into the laptop via a USB connector and the software does the rest.  I had pretty much given up on digital photography, but now find that I am using the camera a lot and easily sharing pictures with friends over the Web.The only drawback to this laptop is that it gets quite hot when it's in use for awhile.  (I've noticed that happens with my MacBook Pro too, as well as with other laptops I've had. But the Pro doesn't present a problem because I don't use it on my lap because it's a bit too large for comfort).  So I purchased a lightweight, insulated lap pad and now I have no problem keeping the MacBook on my lap for hours.I am incredibly enthused about the 13 inch MacBook and highly recommend it to everyone.  It is a great value for the price.  I only wish I had converted to Mac sooner.","Date":"September 28, 2007"}
{"Title":"happy recent mac convert!","Author":"K. Swanke","ReviewID":"R3QJ5MD0JF9MX5","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently gave my Dell Inspiron to my parents and bought a macbook after harboring much antagonism towards Macs.  My frustration with Windows' reliability and the testimonials of a couple of friends who recently converted to macs inspired me to spring for one, and life has been much better since!  I love the mag power cord, the compact size of it (although I was worried about the small screen size -- which has proved only difficult when reading and typing in word, so I just use the zoom feature and set it at 150%), and the great programs including dashboard and ilife suite.  I installed office for mac and have found it to be a great improvement over office for windows.One day I got real confused over how to uninstall a program I had installed and changed my mind about.  I kept trying to look for a \"add/remove programs\" in the system preferences menu, but couldn't find one.  Finally, after asking my roommate, I learned that all you have to do is drag the program icon from the finder onto the trash icon!  It took care of everything automatically.  I didn't believe the fix would be that quick, so I found a forum online, and indeed, it was that easy.  Microsoft had trained me that these matters are complex.  Apple simplifies them.My other worry was that I wouldn't like the keyboard, but I think I like it either just the same or better than those with beveled-edge keys.  The programs work pretty well with each other, the mail program and address book feature is fantastic (especially for downloading v-cards), and the photo booth program is incredibly fun and addictive.  My only complaint (that I share with a couple of my friends) is that the iphoto program is confusing and cumbersome for organizing your photos.  I miss just creating folders for events in Windows, and haven't yet taken a lot of time to figure out the best way of grouping my pictures so that they're consistent in the finder (the windows \"my computer\" counterpart) and in iphoto.  In its defense, though, it's real easy to modify pictures through iphoto, and I like that feature.all in all, I would definitely recommend converting to mac if you're typically a windows user, it's both pretty painless and very enjoyable.","Date":"November 25, 2007"}

Due for an upgrade on my notebook, i decided to give the new macbook a look.  I'm glad i made that choice!!  this machine absolutely is worth the $1,100 price tag.  the new mac os x leopard blows away windows vista.  The macbook is very user friendly and easy to use. some of the features this machine has will take Microsoft 10 years to develop and implement on their machines.  The iLife suit can is included with this machine, which includes iphoto, iweb, imovie, and garage band (don't use that much).  Safari web browser is second to none.  Explorer always gave a distorted, over the top look and feel when surfing the web.  Safari shows exactly what you need, with very easy configuring if necessary.  I consider myself to have moderate computer wisdom, it didn't take me long at all to figure out and operate a mac.  Within 2 days of exploring its layout, I was rolling with it.  Overall great product, if you still use window pc's like me at work or at home, mac virtually converts everything, so their should be little difficulty adjusting.  Some improvements I would like to see apple make are boosting up the gigs on this thing.  At this point 120 and up should be the standard.  Also, .Mac, although a very good user interface and emailing setup, is a little expensive.  It should come down to about $50 annually.Update: macbook (entry level white) just upgraded to 120 gigs and a 2.1ghz processor.  If it's in your budget, check out the macbook pro, apple's best!!","Date":"November 14, 2007"}

Let's just get it out of the way right now: yes, it is cool, yes the Unix-based operating system is good. Yes, it is virus-free. In other words, it has a lot of things that other laptop makers can't claim.And yet: I have had mine 8 months, and increasingly, I have to end sessions because I get the \"spinning beachball of doom\", indicating that RAM is being hit (i.e. is processing and I can't do anything). I went into the Apple store and they told me it was not spyware, but \"you have too many sessions open at once\". And yet, it happens when I have one single session open. To be fair, I am not 100% sure that this is Apple's fault. It could be something else that I don't see right now. But it didn't used to happen. I hate ending sessions with the \"beachball of doom\".Another issue is battery life: for instance, I often leave my MacBook with 50 % power. When I turn it on the next morning, it is dead and I have to start back at 0 %. Why ?Battery life seems to be the achilles heel for Apple, on most of their products.Thus: 3 stars.","Date":"August 12, 2007"}

I go to an art school down in Chicago, and every person that I talked to that has ever owned a Mac said that they are much better with artistic things that a PC. Its true! I use my computer for photoshop as well as a couple animation programs and its as fast as a bullet. Alot of people get turned off when they see that is has only 1GB of RAM, but keep in mind that if you get any PC with Windows Vista, Vista is sucking almost 1 GB just running. I found that the transition from a PC to a Mac was not that hard at all. I was an avid PC fan that even ridiculed and hated Apple products. After my first 10 minutes with this computer I was hooked. Macs can go from off to surfing the web in 30 seconds. Also everything that you do one your PC can be done on a Mac in about 5 less steps and in half the time. The thing I love most about this Macbook however is it has a slightly bigger hard drive than the regular white Macbook. Before this I had a semi-top of the line 15\" ASUS with a high resolution screen and all the bells and whistles one could ever want with a laptop. Don't get me wrong Asus also makes  a great computer, but this little Black Mac has changed me forever from a PC-anti-Mac-Man to an Apple Fan-For-Life!

I went through all the Sunday ads and specials, went to Dells website, and then compared their prices and features to Apple's Macbook line.  What I found out was that the Macbook actually saved me $200 or so when compared to other laptops that feature the Core 2 Duo processor.  I could have spent $500 on a Windows laptop but the features would not come close to the Macbook.  The Core 2 Duo processor is amazing; the Macbook boots very fast and so do the applications.  The built in webcam is fun to mess around with and I like the power of the built in wireless network as well.  Also, most Windows laptops do not offer a DVI port but the Macbook allows you to use  DVI with an option $20 adaptor - this was another thing that sealed the deal for me.  I have an HD LCD TV and a Samsung DVI LCD and I would like to use either one of them with my laptop.  The screen is glossy and crystal clear.  The laptop is light - only weighs six pounds.

{"Title":"Lots of problems","Author":"anonymous","ReviewID":"R68RRZUGK4EXW","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a Macbook last June. Here are the things that have gone wrong with it since then:1. Computer shut down repeatedly at random times. This was eventually fixed with a software update.2. Battery stopped working. Had to be replaced.3. Headphone jack started to malfunction, so that I couldn't use the speakers. This went away on its own after a long time.4. Ethernet port ceased to work.5. Case became discolored, and a piece chipped off. Other macbooks I've seen have a sliver missing in the same place.Other problems that aren't bugs. Just annoyances:1. Mac OSX won't work with my Canon scanner. I got it working with Boot Camp.2. Mac OSX wouldn't recognize the satellite modems that were available to me while I was traveling abroad.3. The speakers are extremely soft and lousy sounding.-------In spite of all these issues, I've liked the laptop and the operating system. I was an early buyer, and they may have made the machines more reliable since 2006.","Date":"September 19, 2007"}

This is really a huge leap over the designs in other laptops: the CD drive does no pop out. The CD drive is always inside the computer. That is a huge plus. Apple is really leaps ahead of other computer companies in terms of hardware. This computer is also incredibly small. From a hardware point of view, it is almost perfect.I have been a windows user for a long time, and I'm pretty much fed up with it. With open office out there, much of the windows office suite is becoming obselete. It's easy to install open office on mac, as well as windows office - windows office will cost you another 200 dollars though. So far, I am very happy with my decision to go mac.","Date":"June 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"Nice hardware, but Apple usability advantage is a myth","Author":"The 14 Amazons","ReviewID":"R2TJARDK3RO0R","Overall":"good","Content":"After developing R.S.I. I decided to invest in a macbook on the theory that Apple's legendary usability would put less stress on my hands.  What a mistake!  Nearly every common operation takes longer in finder than exlorer, many operations and configurations are as far from 'intuitive' as anything in Windows (much further in some cases).  Yes the O.S. is more stable (just), but can't say the same for much of the software - and the lack of good quality, free software is disappointing (even good quality paid software is harder to find).I've been using it for about 6 months now so it can't just be lack of familiarity.  There are so many areas in which OS X is flawed or lacking compared to Windows that I can only conclude that the mac's reputation for usability is pure bluff and hype.  The thing that's saved the macbook for me is installing vmware fusion so that I can run XP on it.  Could have got a really sweet Windows-based notebook for the price though!","Date":"November 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"Made in China...","Author":"M. Orbuch","ReviewID":"RY8IL4VPXT0KK","Overall":"good","Content":"...and not in Taiwan, as the Powerbooks were and the Macbook Pros are. And it shows, at least in some aspects of the machine. The processor is fast, the machine is compact, light and slick-looking, while Mac OS X is rock-stable.The keyboard is my real gripe; 2 days old and the it needs to be replaced as the \"chicklet keys\" are wobbly and the click-bar below the track pad is variably responsive at the edges. Oils from one's hands can smudge the polycarbonate case but the avidity of dirt is less an issue with the black model. The glossy screen is sharp with great color saturation but the glare from it in brightly lit rooms is somewhat distracting. On the whole it is a solid machine for a competetive price but if you can spare the $350-500 differential, check out the new 15\" LED-backlit Macbook Pro's, particularly if you're a heavy user and prefer the better keyboard action of the higher-end models.ADDENDUM:The keyboard was swapped under warranty and the experience is far improved. Keys, track pad and buttons are as they should have been to start. While my estimation of the machine has risen, the new Macbook Pro is still is worthy of the extra expense.","Date":"June 13, 2007"}

Childcare \"Child Care Guy\"","ReviewID":"R3JCWFHB2M1MD4","Overall":"good","Content":"I have found the transition from Windows XP to Mac OS X to be slow and frustrating. For me the Mac has been frustrating and highly NON-intuitive.  I hate Windows-based computers, for their unreliability and frequent crashes. But I actually miss Windows XP when I want to download specific photos from my camera;  burn a CD ROM or a DVD, with items chosen from various folders;  or edit my web site.  The Macbook efficiently and reliably does what it wants to do, but not what I want to do. Even when I have expert advice from experienced Mac users, I find the computer to be recalcitrant.  I tried to present a simple basic slide show, and we needed to turn off the music and special effects half a dozen times.  I expect my Mac to be reliable, and I must admit it has only crashed once in two months. Eventually, when I have learned OS X, I may love my Mac. The display is beautiful. For now however, the path is long and slow.","Date":"October 10, 2007"}

{"Title":"not impressed","Author":"Robert west","ReviewID":"R46IM62ZXQYPH","Overall":"good","Content":"you know i thought i would try my first mac based on all the positive raves about how great apples are, there is this buzz about them that it is  magical experience and that all the ills you have with your PC will be obsolete and that it is a superior under the radar computer. Everyone that owns an apple swears by it. I tried this unit for a couple days and i have to say i did'nt like it. for one thing the palm rest gets very hot and emanates and uncomfortable electromagnetic radiation on your hands or on your lap if you keep it there, very similar to \"cell phone ear\" for some reason that bugged me my pc laptop does not do that i beleive because of the thin size of this notebook the hotness is a trade off , i did'nt like the keyboard either , now onto a completely newer operating system , granted i never really took the time to fully learn it but my impression of it is this, it is supposed to be intuitive and more user friendly than windows, i think it is dumbed down , furthermore i think that windows is great if you have it working well, the advantage that this apple has supposedly is that it is less prone to bugs virus's crashes and things of that nature. All in all after using it for a couple days i really missed computers and decided to return it, i am now shoppng for a new pc laptop. Alot of the stuff apple gives you is based around photo's music and movies , which is kinda nice in  way but i still feel that apple is a niche product and that there is a reason why 90% of people still use windows based pc's. windows may not be perfect but it is a universally usable product that is the best way to use the internet among other things. And apples are'nt exactly cheap either. And there is still alot of stuff like peripherals and programs that don't work for apple os , even though apple is growing alot of stuff is still left out for apple users. Also i have heard that windows vista has copied and knocked off alot of the good features of apples OS tiger 10.4 , ultimately i wanted to like this computer but i feel it does'nt live up to it's hype. you get an expensive computer with a bunch of preinstalled music movie web publishing programs thats basically it.","Date":"July 25, 2007"}

Now with Leopard, I can monitor my kids computer time, set child/computer bedtimes, view/limit and the websites and I don't have to pay extra for this it is built in.

It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size.  It's held up very well.  One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap.  No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook.  In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review.  Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second.","Date":"June 18, 2009"}

I unboxed it and turned it on and everything worked as it should.I have been servicing computers for 42 years and this was one of the most trouble free installs I have ever done.","Date":"December 5, 2010"}

{"Title":"excellent product AND seller","Author":"grenadierART","ReviewID":"R262D18MQXOQLG","Overall":"good","Content":"Great product and great seller.This product was excellent. I was looking for a portable pc to use at home or anywhere for my home business as a freelance artist. I needed a computer that would run all my programs, hold my files, and got access to the internet, along with other things like usb and earphone attatchments. In terms of minor damage such as scratches etc., I was only missing a couple of the rubber feet from the bottom. Runs fast, good memory & storage, Windows XP is great, much easier to use than windows 7. It came with a working power cord, and has a fairly long battery life (so far about 5-8 hours depending on what I'm doing. I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend this if you're looking for a computer under $200. And because I know no one wants to go through the hassle of ordering a computer to find out it doesn't work, having to return it, etc.; I would also say this is a valid seller; I actually needed to contact him through email, and he was quick, accurate, and helpful.","Date":"May 28, 2012"}

We emailed 5 Star electronics often and always got a response but not thinking of the postal situation in the northeast we wanted it now.  The more impatient I got the more paranoid I became and filed a claim for not recieving the computer.  Soon after customer service called and let me know the status of the order and when I was told at the beginning of the week I was told it would be here friday, today is saturday and the laptop arrived in good used condition, completely restored to factory defaults and good programs already installed.  My daughter loves it and if you're like me and have very little patience I recommend you call them their customer service is fantastic and I can't find my keys on sunny days and 5 star is still business operational with little delivery support and a waterlogged state.

{"Title":"Awesome Laptop","Author":"SClark","ReviewID":"R2BERILAEZ6A0S","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased one of these back in 2007 and it is still running strong.  Yes there is a video card issue with them.  They need to be on flat free from debris, table clothes, and other stuff that will limit air flow.  I have only had to bake my video card once and replaced the thermal pads on the CPU and GPU with artic silver with no further issues.  Also get the I8K GUI software to control your fans and monitor your CPU and GPU so you know when it is time to service it yourself.  This laptop is highly serviceable and the documentation has always been available from Dell.  The only downside is that you do need to clean it and replace the thermal paste periodically due to the amount of heat that is created from running this powerhouse.  I recommend replacing the hard drive with a Solid state unit since it is blazing fast then and extends the battery time to something realistic.  The standard battery time while gaming is only 45 min due to the awesome graphics and processing.","Date":"January 5, 2013"}
{"Title":"Great machine from a not so great company","Author":"Daiho","ReviewID":"R2CIU0TH6E3T9H","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this computer from Dell in 2007.  At the time it was one of the most powerful laptops available and retailed for approximately US$3000.  I have carried it across the world and used it in Japan, Nepal, India, Thailand, the US, and now in the Middle East.  I am still using it today.Like hundreds of others, mine suffered from the poorly installed graphics card, but fortunately this didn't cause serious trouble until this year, when I had to have the card remounted.  Dell does not provide this service and will not tell you how to do this.  Nor will they sell you a reasonably priced replacement graphics card, as they are keeping what they have for computers still under warranty.The only other problem I've had is the loss of both power sources.  Batteries quite naturally have a short shelf life, but I've never had a AC power source burn out on any appliance I've ever owned.  Only on this Dell.  And getting a replacement was a bit of a hassle as this machine uses a bit more current than your average computer.Otherwise, this has been a wonderful machine.  On balance, it has provided far more hours of productivity and entertainment than it has hours of frustration.#","Date":"November 24, 2011"}

They had fantastic customer service and took care of me no problem after some security questions were asked.  This one arrived and it was fantastic from the beginning.  It still has served me well though the military, medical school and graduate school, as well as being a pretty high end gamin machine.  It does relatively well even today, though for gaming it is now underpowered; for anything else it is still great.  This laptop is one of the best and most reliable; I've updated it to windows 7 x64 and the RAM to a full 4G to keep it as current as possible.This is a great machine and I will gladly buy from Dell again - in fact I'll probably stick to high-ends and get an alienware from them in the next year or two.","Date":"January 16, 2011"}

It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size.  It's held up very well.  One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap.  No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook.  In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review.

Having tape on the bottom of my computer just to hold the battery in isn't something that I enjoyed. Next time you sell something you should tell people what is wrong with it so that they know what they are buying before doing so, you would like buying something thinking that it is perfectly good and getting it and finding that it is broke in some way shape or form.But other than the crack on the bottom of my computer everything else is good.Thank you,Emaleigh Trautloff","Date":"March 12, 2013"}

{"Title":"Item not as described....","Author":"Betsy Kiehl","ReviewID":"R1LLU9CQOOLO68","Overall":"good","Content":"Over all, the iBook is all right, and it works really well  However, when something is advertised as \"like new\" the buyer expects that to be true within reason.  I expected that since it was used, even though it was described as \"like new\" there may be a few barely noticeable scuffs, etc.  However, this iBook had MANY scuffs and scratches, it is badly scratched and scuffed.  To be honest, I would not have purchased it if it were described  in any way OTHER than \"like new.\"  So I feel their description of the iBook was misleading.  I don't plan to return it.....there are covers etc. I can buy that will hide the scuffs etc.","Date":"April 9, 2014"}

It is much smaller than many of the PCs operating on the MSDos systems.  It has plenty of speed, plenty of memory and is very easy to use.  It is so lightweight and easy to carry with you that it has advantages over some of the larger, heavier laptops.  I own a very nice PC laptop, but, it is larger and heavier.  The little iBook G3 is so light and small that I often take it instead.  The computer arrived quickly and in good shape.  There was information included in the package for support.  The newer models are indeed faster and do have more RAM, but I only paid about 14% of the cost of these newer models for the older, yet very capable iBook G3.  I am thinking about purchasing another one for my colleagues to use in the field.  I also purchased covers for the computer at Amazon and they were a fraction of the cost listed elsewhere.","Date":"April 24, 2011"}

{"Title":"awesome portable workhorse","Author":"Buyin Guy \"The mac fixer guy\"","ReviewID":"R3GZ5HMPIE4HMF","Overall":"good","Content":"This iBook G4 GREAT for typical web-surfing, email, word/spreadsheet/office work, and for doing 95% of what most computer users want in a portable.  It is compact and powerful. I've used one for several years for trips and weekends- I can keep up on email, play music, even watch a movie on it (DVD player built in)..The 1.33ghz has built-in WIFI and bluetooth, so my external keyboard works perfectly with it, and I use it in any coffee shops or WIFI zones while travelling.The weakest point (in my perspective) is that it's not a powerhouse processor. If you're thinking of making movies on it, you're going to find yourself spending a good bit of time. But for 95% of what people do on laptops, this thing ROCKS!  The battery life ranges - - I've seen 45 minutes, and with a brand new battery 3.5hrs. i'm also a super power-user, so I generally \"run the wheels off\" anything I use.. so comparatively you might see it last a wee bit better..The comparison to a netbook is very true. And this thing actually has a hard drive!  and, what's best: if you lose it or it gets stolen, you're not out $1300  --- the purchase price is very reasonable by comparison.  I know a handful of folks with these 12\" 1.33's, and they all love them.","Date":"December 4, 2010"}

This lap top comes with the software you need... you don't need any other software... because its everything you need. I was really hoping this thing wouldn't replace my windows and something to give to my older brother for school. but this devise belly's up to the bar, now i just want to throw away that windows 7. it my be a down grade of software, it is smooth it is speedy.

Pros: great operating system, ( osx leopard 10.5.8). No set up required or installations necessary.ok software preinstalled. used, but came in pretty good condition, with only surface scratches. came with everything the seller described plus extras (laptop carrying bag).Cons: ibook g4 gets really hot on the bottom. unable to udpate to lastest programs, such as adobe flash, google chrome etc. the ibook g4 (os x 10.5 leopard) is a power pc so most web program updates are not compatable with this system (adobe,browsers etc). the updates are for intel pc's which this is not, so thats why you cant install program updates. only browser compatable is safari 5.0, firefox 3.6, camino and a few others (old versions). On youtube the flash loads up slow and lags with this g4 ppc, but its manageable. 4 stars for good condition of ibook g4. 5 stars for the OS. 1 star for the processor speed. 4 stars for the seller of this notebook. overall 3.5 stars. PS if your a windows person this is the wrong pc for you unless you want a change from virus prone windows. completely different platform from windows which'll take some getting use to.","Date":"November 9, 2011"}

I'd been shopping for a refurbished laptop for a while, not wanting to spend the money for a new laptop for a 16-year old at this time.  The G4 got great reviews and, since my wife owns a newer MacBook that my son borrowed constantly, I thought the iBook would ease the competition in our home for computer resources.  This particular model has lived up to its reviews extremely well--it's a functional, solidly made appliance that has all the capabilities needed, including Bluetooth connectivity and a connection to our home wireless network via AirPort.  It's certainly not as flashy as the newer, forged-from-a-single-block-of-aluminum model, but it fills the bill splendidly.  This iBook looks to be a real workhorse and the price can't be beat.  I think I'll start looking for one for myself now....","Date":"January 22, 2011"}

This would seem like it would be pretty simple for microsoft and windows machines to handle but they constantly slow down, sputter, and take longer and longer to start up and turn off.Having two friends who have used Macs for years I decided to buy a used one and see how it performs with daily usage and if it compares or if it is better. This machine, while old and likely out dated by newer models is awesome. The Iphoto App is wonderful and easy, installing Office was so simple I could not believe it and a few other pieces of software.

I was skeptical as the price was so low but all I read was good reviews. I recently broke my Sony Vaio. Even though this computer is many years old, in my opinion it is still sleeker and stylish compared to newer computers.It has a different operating system than most computers but I'm getting used to it. It is in great condition, only thing I noticed wrong with it was a letter on the keyboard was vanishing but I know what letter it is so it works for me. All in all this computer is great and well more than worth the $100 I paid for it. The outer condition looks brand new, and I'm so happy to have a computer again, I would definitly buy from Go Get Computers again and definitly would purchase the Apple IBook G4 again. As a matter of fact I don't think I'll ever purchase a non Apple product again. Amazing how they hold their value. Thanks GoGetComputers and Apple!","Date":"April 23, 2013"}

{"Title":"This laptop will last a very long time!","Author":"Brandon","ReviewID":"R157G06W5UA2Y4","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had an ibook G4 since 2004. I bought it brand new back then. Its now 2011 and I am writing this review with that very laptop. I've had 2 other computers since the time I bought this laptop that no longer work. Apple products may be expensive but they last forever. I have never had problems with this computer. Its battery life is actually about 2 hours longer than my dell laptop I bought last year. Most of laptops more than 5 years old have a battery life of about 5 seconds. Thats pretty impressive. Of course this laptop has inferior specs compared to computers today, but you can still do basic things like browse the internet, write papers, synthesize music (yes it comes with garageband), photoshop, some games, etc.Its operating system is immune to all windows viruses. There is hardly any malware out there for mac os x. So you're computer won't slow down overtime from browsing the web like windows will. People say there are no programs for macs, but since the popularity of macs has risen over the years this is no longer true. I have all the basic programs I have on my windows computer like Microsoft Word, VLC, Firefox, MSN messenger, etc. Just a note, the highest operating system you can have for this computer is Mac os x leopard as it doesn't not have an intel processor.I'd recommend this computer if you want save money. Don't expect to play modern day games on it or anything, but expect to find most of your favorite windows programs written for mac. Still 7 years later this computer is still going strong.","Date":"April 27, 2011"}

The warrantee was expired, but they took time on the phone to help resolve the problem and sent me a recovery disc at a very low cost.  They helped brainstorm the problem by phone and email.  I was able to resolve it, but I'm sure they would have made it worth the postage to return it for them to do the work if it had been a hardware issue.","Date":"April 19, 2011"}

My friend refurbished an old Sony Vaio for me, and admittedly I'll be sad to see this one go. My issues with it throughout its lifetime:1. Mousepad messed up. It was a very minor thing (I think the clicker wasn't working well?) and Geek Squad actually completely made it un-useable. My warranty expired right after they \"fixed\" it, so I just used a mouse ever since. If I use the pad, the mouse will just jump all over the screen and click things. Again, Geek Squad's fault. They're horrible.2. It overheats... But that's because I never clean the fan. Woops.3. Battery can finally not be charged (after five years+, I'd say that's a good lifespan for a battery), but works fine plugged in!4. Got some nasty viruses and had to get the hard drive revamped about.... 2 times? But that wasn't the equipment's fault.All in all, super glad I made this purchase.

{"Title":"It's almost perfect - after a few tweaks.","Author":"ScOObydoo","ReviewID":"R23TK6K6C7HSNU","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me start by saying that out of the box this product would never receive 4 stars. This is why; Vista on 1Gb of ram just won't do.Samsung have clearly listened to some complaints as my unit did not come with McAfee installed, in fact that amount of bloatware was very limited. Upon booting the device installs itself, then needs an hour to create a backup on its drive. Which is annoying because it places it on a hidden partition swallowing up 13Gb of storage (of your 60Gb).The touch settings in Vista are pretty bad by default, so you really need to tweak those a lot to get them right (turn off the silly mouse \"help\" pointer, enable the keyboard instead of handwriting recognition etc...).After that you need to do something mean to it; rip it open and swap out the 1Gb module for a 2Gb one. It's not for everyone but there are some very handy video tutorials online. All you need is a small screwdriver and steady hands. The 2Gb module (2Gb DDR2 notebook memory) cost me $49. With 2Gb you'll notice a MASSIVE increase in speed. Applications now run smoothly, open fast and there is little to no disk memory swapping. But like I said; it's not a question of an easy to open panel, you need to remove the entire backside of the machine to reach the ram. Why Samsung don't just deliver it with 2Gb is beyond me.Once you have upgraded the ram and tweaked the OS you need to turn off the Vista indexing service (google it), this reduces the amount of drive accesses for indexing your files. All that does is help with file searches which you probably rarely do anyway.Now with 2Gb, better tweaks and some services turned off you'll want to turn off the Vista Aero settings (once again; google it).It's taken you 2 hours, but now you have a PERFECT speedy little UMPC that runs nice and fast.Some general observations:The mouse pointer is beyond useless. It has little to no acceleration, use the stylus and keep the mouse in joystick mode, it'll make scrolling much easier.The \"dialpad\" popup keyboard is horrendous, ignore it and never touch it again.The keyboard on the device itself is for emergencies only. Because that is about the only time you'll put yourself through the agony of typing something on it. The best and (in my opinion) fastest way to type is with the on screen keyboard, or the (optional) Samsung portable keyboard (or any small keyboard of your choice). The Samsung is listed for $89, but comes with a built in eraserhead mouse. Amazon has a folding Bluetooth keyboard for $29 which is a great option for this machine.Audio is impressive, nice and loud.Wifi is great, it connects much faster than my Dell XPS notebook and never drops a signal.The device boots in under a minute and wakes from sleep in around 12 seconds (including connecting to wifi).The screen is perfect; great resolution and extremely bright and sharp.Heat is an issue. It DOES get warm, but never to the point where it will burn you or that it becomes too hot to handle.The Microsoft Origami interface is awesome. Anyone that has seen Media Center will recognize the look and feel. It's a media center/application launcher optimized for touch screens.Bluetooth is stable, they use the Widcomm Bluetooth stack (which put simply means they use a third party company for the Bluetooth software and not the limited Microsoft package).The package is a little limited. You get the unit, a charger, a battery, a wrist strap (that also works as a handle, very clever) and a cheap (poor quality) case. In my opinion Samsung should have delivered it with the organizer case and a keyboard, but I fully understand they wanted to keep costs low on it.All in all it's a winner. I picked it over the competition (Sony UX380 or the OQO model II) because of the screen and the fact that I can upgrade the Ram. The Sony is limited to 1Gb no matter what you do, and the OQO is underpowered with a VIA cpu. Even though this device is only 800MHz I felt that it ran faster than the OQO model II I tested.  It also has the perfect screen size to resolution ratio. The Sony has a higher resolution screen, but is 2 inches smaller making it near impossible to work on for longer durations.My only real annoyance with Samsung is the model numbering on the Q1 ultra series. First of all; calling it Q1 was plain stupid. The previous model was also called Q1, and it's nothing like this machine, so google searches for \"q1 ultra\" return 100's of hits on \"q1 ultra portable\" which is usually NOT this device. Note to Samsung; next time, call it Q2.Then the various models of the Q1 Ultra; they make one with no Bluetooth or cameras, one with Vista, 2 cameras and Bluetooth but no fingerprint scanner, one with XP, 2 cameras, Bluetooth and a fingerprint scanner and several others. All with cryptic names. Bad move. It's near impossible to determine what the exact specifications are of this machine.All in all I can highly recommend the Samsung Q1 Ultra for people shopping for an ultra portable PC. If you use Skype, Office, Internet Explorer/Firefox, Mail and most other basic applications you will be very happy (once again; only on 2Gb). It won't do well on heavy applications like video editing or graphic designs.","Date":"December 26, 2007"}
{"Title":"Love it","Author":"P. Knopf","ReviewID":"R2T30WI9TRF5DD","Overall":"good","Content":"I own a dual core laptop with 2 gigs ram and a fast hardrive and was looking for something to take notes one, a small tabletthat was small enough to carry in my laptop bag with my laptop, but large enough to take notes on.So far this device has exceeded my expectations.I have taken notes on it for 2 days now with MSFT's onenote loaded.The machine keeps up with my writing.I loaded all of MSFT office enterprise edition on it for the fun of it and Lotus notes 7 for my corp email.I am trying the new windows live mail instead of using outlook for my personal email. I love this as well as I can read my personal outlook emails on the device and my personal gmails at once without them being deleted so my regular laptop still has a full email record.I am starting to use the MSFT Origami interface that comes with it, and so far I like the interface for playing music.The device only has 1 gig of ram, but I have open and am using onenote, windows live mail, lotus notes, a few browser windows, word  and am playing music on it with only the most occasional music stutter.... with the Vista OS.It launches applications slowly once you have consumed the ram and the hard drive isn't all that fast ... but once launched it swaps between applications fine.(+- 11 sec to load excel as opposed to +- 4 sec on my fast LT)Remember I only bought this to take electronic notes on .....  but I may even leave my laptop at home next trip.I am buying the larger 6 cell battery (I think it should have come with this already for the price) but I got over +- 3.5 hours with wireless on and connected with the std battery.  I hope I will be able to have Samsung upgrade this later and add a  cellular chip in this model  but I doubt they will do that....  If you need cellular, I'd say wait.So what don't I like,Some usability nits with the key positioning, a tad more spacing would be better, rubberized keys perhaps and the most popular extra keys positioned on the outside (like the esc key).Of course I'd love a faster CPU, more ram and a faster hard drive, but I'll always say this ......This device is usable as it is, when a faster one comes out I may chuck my laptop away for good.","Date":"July 26, 2007"}

Oh well that's what the xbox360,PS3, and Wii are for. Yeah you might have to wait a couple seconds longer to load an application and the keys are a little close together, but who really cares? I use the stylus for just about everything and this computer can do everything yours does or more! The 7 inch bright 1024 by 600 native resolution is absolutely perfect. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy a computer regardless of desktop,laptop etc. especially college students or anybody that likes to take notes, doodle, and journal.

{"Title":"Fabulous Machine!","Author":"Ronald M. Cordes \"Watch Looker\"","ReviewID":"R3CWKQI7PD0T7D","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Q1 Ultra NP-Q1UA000 with Windows XP installed.  (I read so many other reviews suggesting that Vista was too taxing on the processor and 1 GB of memory).  The bottom line is:  This is everything I expected it to be and more!  I did order the portfolio/keyboard combo but it is still on backorder.  Nevertheless, the variety of input methods (stylus, on-screen keyboard, dial keys and split Qwerty buttons) work extremely well for me.  I bought this machine for two purposes: to check email on the road and to provide a compact way of taking notes during the many work meetings I attend. Its internet capability using Wi-Fi is as smooth as silk and the note taking via Windows Journal and One Note is really neat after you get the hang of it.  The screen resolution is really nice and its readability is enhanced by the brightness settings using the sensitive touch buttons at the top.  Samsung thought of most every niche including a slot for MMC and SD cards--a feature that allows me to share camera shots without hogging hard disk space.  With Windows XP, in lieu of Vista, only 16 of the 60 GB hard drive is used...and that includes the full suite of Microsoft Office 2003 and several other larger programs.  I've read a number of critical reviews about this UMPC but for me, this little jewel is A-1.  Negative things?  OK, the split Qwerty buttons are small, but the on-screen keyboad (and the USB keyboard on order) suppresses that frustration.  The other dislike is that the extended life battery is thicker so that the machine slants to one side when set on a flat surface and I doubt if it will fit too well in the portfolio I have on backorder.  I did order the external USB ODD with the machine and I would highly recommend this to anyone who buys one.  On the other hand, almost any external USB driven DVD/RW will work.  Overall, I am very very happy with this computer.","Date":"September 4, 2007"}
{"Title":"Nice but flawed.","Author":"John G. Bennett \"Tanj\"","ReviewID":"R3528NOHA4WC0K","Overall":"good","Content":"First and foremost, it works and works well.  Both with the original 60GB disk (I used a 4GB \"EP\" SD chip for ReadyBoost) and with a SanDisk SSD I fitted (look up Hugo Ortega for how) it works at nice speed.  The screen is clear and bright, you need good eyesight of course.The flaws:- WiFi range mediocre.  At home it failed to work in a room where several other devices worked fine.  Set up the WiFi in a place where signal is known strong otherwise you will go nuts trying to juggle the mystery messages in the setup screens.- the mouse thingy at the left is virtually unusable.  Last resort.  It is a joystick but it either zooms or crawls, does not seem to have much dynamic range.  Fortunately you can use the cursor or a fingernail.- the screen does NOT allow you to rest your hand on it, the sensor will not be able to figure out the stylus.  This makes handwriting a bit awkward since you need to rest your hand somewhere and almost everything has some kind of button or sensor on it.  Portrait-right mode is the best for right-handed since the lower edge is clear of gadgets.- the split keyboard is not very good.  Not because it is split, but because the buttons are just too easily mistaken and also the choice of what is on the buttons is awkward.  It works, but not any faster than stylus onscreen.  For logins if you have a \"strong\" password you will go nuts trying to get your password right.- THE THUMB READER IS MISSING.  Despite it being in all the images on Amazon, the model they ship does not have the reader.  And I still have not been able to figure out if Samsung will agree to sell it separately.- the velour sleeve supplied has effectively no protection.  You will want something to carry this safely.Battery life seems good, there seems to be minimal crapware installed, in many ways this is a good experience.  But there could be definite improvements.  Handwriting recognition is fast and accurate.  It is a bit large to be a pocket machine but is quite unobtrusive in a bag.  It is big enough to show email, documents, and web quite clearly.","Date":"February 21, 2008"}

You will need to upgrade the memory to 2gb and replace the atheros wifi module. The cheap wifi module causes the system to constantly pause (for up to 10 seconds!).

I've come to not expect much in the performance department of these little PC but they should be able to at least play video files without annoying pauses.

The keyboard is small like many say, but you can get used to it (as long as you don't have really large hands). The screen is touch only (no active digitizer), so you'll run into significant vectoring issues. The processor is slow, but in return you get excellent battery life. So, as long as you're not looking for the performance of a dual-core processor, you'll be able to run your basic office applications and stay productive with extended use times. Finally, the best part of this unit is that it stays relatively cool in your hands compared to many other UMPCs I've tested. I would recommend upgrading it to 2 GB of RAM and running XP instead of Vista.","Date":"March 18, 2008"}

Because I wanted a good compromise between screen quality and portability in a windows device. What for? believe it or not: to be able to run a 3D CAD program (namely DesignCAD). Not realy in order to do the main drawings there, but in order to have them available, be able to look at them when on the go and eventually even create a small item in order to evaluate it. I really was not sure if this would work when i got it...but at $750 for the qiuv i took the risk. I did an upgrade to 2GB and i must say: I AM AMAZED. not only does the design program work perfectly fine (of course not as smooth as on my desktop, but it really does work, including rendering shaded objects and moving them around). Now, with this design program (and many other programs too) it is helpful to have keys available in order to enter commands. the keys around the screen are doing a great job here. And the fact that you have a tablet pc in a slate shape and still access to hardware keys is really extremely convenient and you find yourself sitting in a coffee shop surfing the web with a little something in your hand. This device really has been designed with the end user in mind. It definitely changes the way one uses a pc when on the go. I do agree that for longer texts i would use an external keyboard, but being used to the thumb keyboards from my pocket pcs i learned typing blindly on the keyboard rather fast and i use it for chatting and emailing on a daily basis. the qiuv has become my daily companion and i simply love it.","Date":"June 11, 2008"}

In addition I've been pleasantly surprised by how good their customer service is even though I hate the loss of US jobs.  The 9420 has a huge bright screen for those of us that need 3-4 windows going at the same time.  The keyboard is a nice size so I don't have to scrunch my hands together when typing long projects, and I like the number pad off to the side for quick spreadsheet work.  The keys also seem to be built a little sturdier than some other brands.  2GB of RAM is just fine for most things and seems to run the VISTA Memory Monster just fine.  Word to the wise, don't get less than 2GB of RAM if you're running Vista.  I wouldn't consider this a hardcore gaming computer at all (nor any laptop for that matter) but I can play some good games just the same.  Hard drive size is good at 240GB, multi-card reader is a great feature, and the AMD TL-64 chip seems to be pretty speedy but all that power runs awfully hot so you won't want to work with the computer on your lap for too long unless you're out of hot chocolate on a frosty winter day.  The outside of the computer looks very nice with the slick black finish but it is a fingerprint/smudge magnet.  Thank God good Ole HP threw in a small \"computer napkin\" AT NO EXTRA CHARGE just for that reason.  Those people think of everything!  The only con is the mouse pad.  The old style had a texture to it so your finger would slide smoothly, the 9420's pad is now smooth and gets a little sticky at times.  I'm also not a fan of the new mouse pad page scroller.  For some reason it doesn't seem to interact with webpages quite as well as their old one.  It appears to be a software issue or I just haven't figured it out yet.  All in all I'm very happy with the purchase, I feel I got a lot of computer at a relatively affordable price and that's saying something because I'm cheap.  I sure wish they would've given me more than just a trial version of Office2007, but that's ok, I'll just use the free OpenOffice software instead \"HAHA! Take that Microsoft!\".

When it arrived my husband and I were so impressed, we bought another for him. I will warn you right now if you order more than one of these laptops, you can only get a rebate for one through amazon.com. They do not allow more than one rebate for this per household. I did not get that information until after I purchased both.As for the laptop, I found the layout of the keys to be comfortable and I like that I am able to turn on and off the wireless at the touch of a button. Playing movies on this laptop looks great as well. The picture comes out clear and easy to see (not grainy and fuzzy).I do have to add, I'm not thrilled that it came with Windows Vista. I have tried Vista in the past and I'm not a fan. Unfortunately even if you order this laptop straight from HP you still don't have the option of a different operating system, so you might as well save some money and order from Amazon.One last thing to add, when I received my laptop, my power cord was bad. It charged my laptop for twenty minutes and then stopped. I called HP the next day and they over-nighted a new power supply to me at no extra charge.

{"Title":"A Fantastic Price but a bit bulky","Author":"J. Fujino \"bookworm\"","ReviewID":"RK7EW8PLXLSJ7","Overall":"good","Content":"Warning: Not for wimps.This computer is a scaled-down desktop replacement, but its still a desktop replacement so if you're thinking you can lug this around on a daily basis then think again.  Your back or your shoulder will probably only be able to handle occasion transport (the computer itself is 7.8lbs and if you factor in  the AC adapter it will go up to about 11 lbs.  Then add accessories like a mouse, put that on a scale and decide if a 15.4\" is really that small a price to pay for portability).Fortunately, it does have beautiful screen and if you're watching DVDs or playing games it will be impressive.  The nVidia 6150 card will do well for a modest gamer but it will not be able to handle upcoming games especially since they are moving on to directx10 graphics and modern games will probably have to run on lower settings.The processor is good, not the best Turion and slower than most Core 2 Duos but it will get the job done and unless you're going to do movie and photo editing or serious gaming you won't have any problems.The biggest weakness of this PC, though, has to be its memory.  1 Gig of Ram is ridiculous to try to run any version of Vista on.  If you're going to purchase this also purchase a gig of RAM and install that as well because Vista really requires at least a gig to run at an acceptable speed.If you aren't an expert than you probably are reluctant to open the bottom of a $1000 piece of equipment and start messing with things.  Another option is to but it direct from HP. You can customize a dv9500 on their site and it will probably cost about the same.  The only problem is they won't offer options like the AMD Turion or 6150.  You'll have to order something more or less powerful.Altogether its an affordable large screen PC with great power for a $1000 but poor mobility.","Date":"July 18, 2007"}

(only 2 are officially supported, but I've seen enough reviews of people upgrading to 4 gig to feel comfortable making the leap.)","Date":"August 16, 2010"}
{"Title":"replaced my desktop","Author":"L. Steiner","ReviewID":"R1TUP9W32HZ0BW","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this computer, since my daughter takes up the desktop most of the time.  I find the keyboard easy to use, and appreciate the number keys to the right.  It has never frozen up on me, and with wifi, I have a great surfing experience.  this computer is sturdy, the screen is bright, and I have no trouble with vista, despite the negative hype.  The only downside to this computer is the size, if you travel alot and need to bring a laptop, I would probably recommend a smaller model.  Also the battery life is fairly short, another travel problem. Other than that, I recommend this affordable, reliable computer.","Date":"December 2, 2008"}
{"Title":"Good value and rock solid now,  would buy another","Author":"Alan","ReviewID":"R2Q76OECF6TDWK","Overall":"good","Content":"Purchased in December 2007. Loved the bells and whistles of this laptop and the display.The good news.......In April HP support released a slew of software updates for this computer including a bios update. MS service pack 1 was also included.After 6 hours of installing the updates the laptop runs flawless, faster and rock solid and great wireless range. I love it now. Awesome for DVD playback and spread sheets. It is now my primary computer.Battery life can be improved in Vista setting tweaks to about 3 hours for video playback. Expect about 2 hours on normal usage.Since then I have increased the operating speed by adding another Gig of memory (about $80.00) and replacing the hard drive with a larger faster 180 gig Sata 7200 rpm drive (about $120.00) and using the original drive in the second drive bay for video's and data. You will need a HP Sata drive caddy to install it (about $35.00). The mouse pad can be sticky due to perspiration.The original bad news....Initially had intermittent web-cam and external USB devices along with loss of audio and changing of display settings and freezing of video playback and system lockup. Returning from hibernation or sleep mode would crash the system or programs would crash it. Just about every problem others had stated.HP support solution was to do a system reload which worked until you added a USB device or 3rd party software.I worked around the problems by reinstalling drivers and not shutting the computer down defeating the purpose of a laptop.","Date":"May 29, 2008"}

With the 9 cell, I can get a it over 3.5 hours.Changing the hard drive is easy as pie! with One restart can be using another hard drive with a different OS on it.Adding Ram, there is one slot UNDER the keyboard and the other on the back,The Ultra Bay will use a 320Gb hard drive and is Hot Swappable. Pull out hard drive, slide in CD drive, pull it out and put in a IonLithium battery which gives about 2 hours more. Without need of doing a restart/reboot. And Linux will recognize this function. The UltraBay is the newer style drive (not ide).I have the 15 inch which has 128 mb video - superb and am extremely happy with the IBM. I had a Compaq before this laptop. Wow! what a difference!Mine is a Off lease laptop. The WIFI works so well, don't need the slot in the left side, I have put in a WiFi Netgear card, but the built int IBM WiFi in the monitor is so good, it actually works better.

{"Title":"Good out of the box, great with a couple of inexpensive upgrades.","Author":"Gonzo","ReviewID":"R346U4BDNTUWD0","Overall":"good","Content":"It is a great laptop if you can get it for under $200.  I actually \"downgraded\" to XP when I first got it, which ran better then VISTA.  A really good thing about this laptop is that you can extend it life and usefulness with a few upgrades.  The easiest is swapping out the memory.  It comes with 1 gig but you can add 4 gigs (2 sticks of 2 gigs)of PC2 5300 memory for about $45.  You can also replace the Hard Drive with a SSD.  But what I recommend is a Hybrid HD/SSD.  I added a 500 gig drive for about $80.  Not only is it a lot cheaper this way,but because the laptop has an older SATA the performance is almost going to be the same as a full solid state because of the bottle neck.The laptop comes with a Intel Core-Duo T2450 which was a decent processor at the time but you can actually \"upgrade\" the chip to a Core 2 Duo T5200 (Socket M) without a bios update and a used chip will only run about $10.  The best part about replacing the chip is that with a Core 2, you can run a 64 bit OS.  So I am currently rocking 64 bit Windows 7 on my MT6840 and it is running great.  Another benefit I found is that the new processor and HD runs a LOT cooler then what came stock.So I would defiantly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a decent affordable laptop with a solid upgrade path that can be done in parts.","Date":"September 25, 2013"}

So began a 5-year love affair that I would never forget. It was comfortable. It was feature rich. Things just \"felt right\" with it, like a broken-in pair of trusty work boots. Sometimes it ran hot overnight, but you were still there.Was it perfect? No. There were a few issues with drivers here & there, but it was in my living room for casual web surfing & mild gaming for years. I got quickly used to the touchpad & classic 2-button layout. Didn't like those? There's 3 above & the classic IBM 'nibber'. The screen was of the no-longer-used 4:3 aspect ratio, giving me outstanding resolution.My question is this: Why did we abandon the 4:3 laptop? I don't need a widescreen display for spreadsheets, websurfing, or dev work. I'm doing that instead of watching The Hunger Games. Most laptops have just 1366x768, and this dinosaur blows them away for pixels(but at a price).I wish the 4:3 laptop would comeback. You would have business users buy them in a heartbeat with a modern version of this. It's just in the screen.Goodnight, Thinkpad. We had a wonderful journey together.","Date":"June 3, 2013"}

{"Title":"Love my Lenovo","Author":"Daniel Haworth \"Flechmen Foxwood\"","ReviewID":"R2FR1IU5OM0SCS","Overall":"good","Content":"Let me tell you a story. A great many years ago, I had an IBM T30. That thing was a tank. It got dropped, battered, and abused. At one point it even flew out of a bicycle toddler trailer and into the middle of a road with very minimal damage. After the life that thing lived in my care, I sold it to a friend, who abused it for 5 more years before the motherboard gave up.After that machine, I was sold on Thinkpads, and I saved up to custom build a T61. I ordered mine direct from Lenovo and had it customized... 4GBs of RAM, nVidia graphics, Windows XP.. Later on, I put a 500GB hard drive in it and Windows 7.Lenovo carried on IBM's legacy with the Thinkpads. The quality on this unit is fantastic.The casing is solid and reliable, all of the components are incredibly reliable. I've never had an issue with my T61.This thing has been taken all over, dropped, stepped on, and battered. And it's taken all of this abuse with just one little piece of plastic breaking off. The lid hinges are solid stainless steel, the top is solid magnesium, the bottom is thick rugged plastic. This is one well built laptop.The nVidia NVS Quadro graphics used to be able to play most games with ease. The most modern of games tax it pretty heavily though. Considering it's a business laptop and not really a gaming one, this is pretty good.All features work well on it, including the kinda gimmicy keyboard light, which actually is quite helpful in the dark. Parts are readilly availble for it as well, so it's an easy machine to fix.Lenovo's support is second to none. After reinstalling Windows on this machine, the only thing you need to download is the Lenovo update utility and it will take care of the rest. Never seen another manufacture do that!The only things I've really had issue with is the power supply, which failed on me after a couple of years, and the sound card, which, like most modern systems, is this little Realtek thing that sounds terrible.But, those are my only real complaints. This poor laptop has been through a lot, and it's been a tough little beast.I would recommend this product.","Date":"February 23, 2013"}
{"Title":"6 y/o ThinkPad T61 still gives other laptops a whipping","Author":"LarryLMedina","ReviewID":"R1CPC9Y0AU3TP6","Overall":"good","Content":"I did not buy this laptop through Amazon but I wanted to share my thoughts here. I'm a poor counselor, living from paycheck to paycheck in highest-in-the-nation-cost-of-living state of Hawaii, and in college working toward my MSW. I needed a robust laptop to put up with college/work/personal life so I bought this T61 from a refurbisher for $130. It came with Win7, 80GB HDD, 2GB RAM and integrated graphics. Key tops were half-worn on the Home row and the LCD is wobbly from worn hinges. When closed, there is still a bit of play with the lid not latching down tightly. 6 years of existence and the laptop does creak a little on sides. I'm not complaining as this is a used T61 and I didn't expect roses.I upgraded the HDD and RAM and installed Windows 8. The T61 boots/runs faster with all the upgrades. The non-glare LCD is easy on the eyes, although dimmer than other non-glare LCD's I've seen (this is likely not due to age, since I read similar comments written back in 2007 when the T61 was first released). The touchpad is the smallest I've ever come across on any laptop and took me a while to get accustomed to. The T61's Trackpoint is a relic from the 1990s and I feel is outdated as a mouse control device and useless like a human appendix or a vestigal tail is. Lenovo still insisted to include it (and still does to this day) apparently to keep Trackpoint fans happy. The keyboard is louder/noiser and less firm than other keyboards I've used on other business/professional-grade laptops; however perfectly usable and comfortable to type on happily for hours without fatigue. Speakers aren't loud; a bit tinny to my ears but clear. The LCD lid's rubber coating mars easily but is easily cleaned up with a wiping of Windex. Contrary to another review written here, the lid itself is not solid magnesium: instead, it is a composite plastic (not carbon fiber) over a magnesium frame. Its construction still does the job in keeping it solid and near-flexible. The T61 is of the \"thin-and-light\" category when \"thin-and-light\" was defined at around 4-5lbs (the weight of this T61 is 5.2lbs with the stock batt). I got a new 7800mah batt off Amazon.com ($25) which bumps the weight up past 6lbs. Thin, yes. Light? No.Incidentally, batt life is 9+ hours with this new 7800mah batt under Win8 and in Power Saver mode, wifi off, and LCD dimmed to 50%.My T61 is good, solid-feeling (and solid-looking) laptop. Everything just works. The T61's early-1990's conservative looks, severely angular lines and all-black color make it look either 20+ years old or modern and contemporary, depending on who's eyeing it (I just think it looks \"classic\"). Other resellers sell T61's with better specs for up to $400 (and likely in better condition than mine) but I'm happy with the one I got and the price I paid for it. //","Date":"August 20, 2013"}

Rugged, affordable, reliable, these older laptops have delivered good performance and are always a solid financial choice, hundreds of dollars below similar, newer products. I purchased mine through Amazon marketplace with XP installed. I like XP and I don't need anything else for now. I installed 2 memory sticks of 2GB RAM each. The laptop, predictably, went to 3.2GB Ram, not 4. That is the maximum you'll get. I also had the HD replaced at Microcenter, but made the mistake of believing the salesman and instead of a full SSD, I let them put a hybrid HD. My laptop is faster than it would have been with its regular HD, but not even close to as fast as it would have been with a Solid State Drive. Besides, Microcenter charged me a pretty penny for the hybrid HD and for the installation. Corollary: install an SSD, period.Still, the laptop is great. I bought it used from Tampa Laptops (great seller, by the way). I tweaked what I judged was necessary and I've had a smooth-running laptop ever since.

{"Title":"Perfect little dev box for a great price","Author":"Steven","ReviewID":"R2KWRBJ3D6SG39","Overall":"good","Content":"I was very surprised to see current reviews on this machine! This thing was born over a half a decade ago!Well, I bought mine because I wanted a separate dev box outside of my 2011 Macbook Pro. I love my MBP, but I already have it setup with Bootcamp (Windows 7), I didn't want to load another OS on it (space is starting to get tight), plus I wanted something that would function as a sort of mini-server for my own personal projects. Finally, I wanted something I could lug around without worrying about breaking it, so I bought this thing.I really couldn't be happier! I decided to replace the existing HDD with a 50 gig SSD that I found at Micro Center (Denver)  for $39 on clearance. I also replaced the battery with an Anker battery which I bought here on Amazon for $40. I loaded her up with Ubuntu and this thing zips right along! ~$180 might seem a little pricey for a 6 year old laptop, but considering this total includes SSD and a brand new battery, I'm quite pleased. SSD is more energy efficient and Ubuntu is fairly lightweight (compared to Windows), so I get a little over 4 hours of battery life which is certainly acceptable for this machine.The display is surprisingly nice and has very little glare, so it's easier on my eyes when compared to the MBP. The trackpad is nice, but not as nice as the MBP trackpad (but what is?). I like all the clicking options - I can touch the trackpad or use the buttons above or below the trackpad. The red tracking button on the keyboard is great and was quite easy to get used to.This thing is a joy to hack around on! SSD is a must, so I recommend throwing a small SSD in it if you can. The 50 gig drive I have now is small, but it's perfect for my needs as I really only use this as a dev box (I use my MBP for things like games, media, etc). Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, the hinges do suck a bit.It's heavy and ugly, but that's how I like it.","Date":"December 18, 2013"}

Shouldn't be a factor if all you're using it for is MS office/web-browsing/emails. Other then graphics use, surfing web, multitasking MS office apps, and general day to day online activities are as buttery as any other modern day laptop.Battery: (using extended battery 6600mah)Typical 3 hours of real life use (outlook open in background, Pidgin chat, and music playing in BG) at 60% screen brightness, can be stretched to 4.5 if I was just web-browsing (no others windows/apps). I had the regular 4400mah battery at first, but it barely ran for 1.5 hours, 2 if I was stingy with it. The bigger 6600mah battery adds bulk, but travelers will appreciate the extra work-time.Design: (will grow on you as time goes on)At first glance I thought, real ugly piece of machinery. Then my work place forced me to use one and boy, it has really grown on me. The keyboard is probably the best I've ever used, EVER. That's coming from owning a couple of Toshibas, Gateways, Sonys, Apples (powerbook & new MBPs), Asus, and HP laptops before. The keyboard alone makes me want to keep this thing forever. Kudos to Lenovo for developing such a great input product. On the downside, the screen isn't very bright, so if you want to work outside one day or are near some one with a newer model laptop (which means newer kind of display technology), the screen will appear very dark.Recommended for: Those on a budget, traveling business typesSeriously, the price you pay (amazon for around $200-300 last time I checked) can't be beat. Those who are on a budget that just want a laptop for browsing the web, chatting online, and streaming movies- this one is a winners' choice.

It was advertised as a T61-8100 with 3 gig RAM, 120 gig HD and Win 7.But, when I ordered it I got the description as above T61-7500, 1 gig RAM, 160 gig HD and Win XP. So, I called and canceled it. Amazon sent a cancel request and the vendor came back to me asking why I'd canceled. I told them and sent a screen shot of the order conf. They wrote back that Amazon was wrong and the machine is as advertised with Win 7 etc.So, I ordered it. It was delivered in 3 days and is the machine I wanted (T61-8100 with 3 gig RAM, 120 gig HD and Win 7). When I opened the box, the machine looks brand new!!  It performs very well and my daughter (10 yrs) is very happy with it.  For $157.00 it's a remarkable buy!!Seems Amazon has some issues with their web site - although Amazon told me they have nothing to do with the product descriptions, I had the same experience with other T61's that were listed; when I put them in the cart the description changed.","Date":"June 16, 2013"}

{"Title":"A Terrific Computer","Author":"Irish Eyes","ReviewID":"R1Y1IPK9B8Z19Y","Overall":"good","Content":"I got this computer to replace my PC and I'm glad I chose this particular one.This notebook comes with Windows Vista Home Premium.  I wasn't too sure about having Vista, but after using it I do like it.  I use this notebook at home and the PC I use at work has XP.  I like Vista better than XP.  The biggest problem I had with Vista is that I could no longer use my very old inkjet printer.  I checked the printer manufacturer's website for a Vista driver and it was not providing a driver for that printer.  I can print from Vista with my somewhat newer laser printer.  I would suggest that before buying any computer with Vista, it would be wise to be sure your printer will run with Vista.The speed of this notebook is excellent.  My husband decided to double the RAM and it is now beyond excellent.This computer is great.  I need to explore more of it to find out everything it can do, but it has more than met my needs so far.  I would highly recommend this computer.In response to another review, I have not had ANY of the problems mentioned.  In fact, when we replaced computers at work a few months ago, I insisted on a Toshiba notebook for me (however it wasn't this particular model).  I do not hesitate to recommend Toshiba.","Date":"December 27, 2007"}

After you have used it for a while you will know what I'm talking about. The speed for the amount of memory amazed me. My roommate has a laptop with 3GB Ram and it is no faster. She was upset because she paid more and has better stats but my laptop is better. Her DVD drive also went out after 6 months of use. This Toshiba is quality. I have never had a problem with it and even though its a little older it runs like new. Decent screen display for a older computer but still not what you will get on a new $800 dollar laptop. Sound quality is decent and gets pretty loud. It just feels sturdy when you use it. It stays much cooler than most laptops under heavy use as well which may have a lot to do with its longevity. I think for the money you couldn't ask for more. If you are looking for a good day to day laptop look no further.","Date":"September 6, 2010"}

Be prepared to do an upgrade (this is very easy, even for the non-techie).  Also, the A135 tends to run very hot - so I recommend purchasing an external USB fan, like this one.Targus AWE81US Chill Hub and Chill Mat with 4-port Hub for Laptops up to 17-Inch - BlackMy assumption is that you'll end up with one of these computers the same way I did - either someone will give you one, or you'll find it dirt-cheap on CL or the auction website that starts with the letter \"e.\" Brand-new laptops can be purchased so cheaply these days that there's no serious reason to buy a Toshiba Satellite A135 and pay $200 for it, but if you stumble upon one for less than $100, it's probably worth buying, if you're looking for a light-duty laptop for grandma or very young kids who don't need the latest and greatest.Also, a fairly common problem, judging by comments/pleas for help posted on various internet message boards, is that many of these laptops bought used have a glitch regarding the bios being locked with a password. There's a complex fix, which is way beyond my skill level, involving a soldering iron and a paper clip. I just decided to live with the locked bios, meaning I can't get into the CMOS settings to change anything, which shouldn't be a massively big deal for most users.Edited, to note, FWIW, I performed a completely unremarkable memory upgrade to 2GB, but the introduction of a used 160 GB hard drive into the belly of the beast killed the lazy old b**ch. Even though the hard drive specs indicated it was a perfect match, something went wrong, and the patient died belly open on the operating table. I removed the new hard drive and reinserted the original one, and all of a sudden, there were bizarre error messages about a network card failure.Pfft. Cracking open the slots on the bottom of the case revealed a solder knocked loose, from what looks like the network card, which was most likely caused by the age of the laptop. A real FUBAR. I could buy a soldering iron and teach myself how to repair the damaged connection, but at the rate I'm going, I might end up burning the house down.

{"Title":"VERY used item asked for evaluation?","Author":"Gwen S. Walcott","ReviewID":"R1YX0MZZP0HP91","Overall":"good","Content":"This was purchased as a sacrificial test bed for software testing.  It was presented as a VERY used item that was far from 100%, so I didn't expect a \"factory new\" product.  Yes, it looks like the heck was beat out of it before it was resold, but (for the most part), it DOES work!  Unit was also shipped with Microsoft Office and AntiVirus software (long out of date, but it did update itself on 2nd use --- 2nd use because of hardware component failure.)  Item was shipped with caveat that battery was \"feet up\", but the battery holds a charge, just that it SOMETIMES doesn't transfer energy to the motherboard (but sometimes, it does).  Ditto the internal NIC card.  It was NOT listed as defective, and (as a matter of fact) presented as fully functional.  Well, it worked the first time, and failed thereafter.  I had to purchase and use a USB adapter to access the Internet (after which, the computer sizzled and popped and the NIC card came back on line and remained for a few days before quiting again.  (I found that smacking the laptop a few times would bring the NIC back on line, because when it sizzled and popped, the computer kept re-rebooting during startup. Smacking it, stopped the sizzle/pop and often brought back the NIC (task bar showing operation of the USB adapter [running at 72Mbps] the internal adapter [when it ran, it was only 11Mbps, so commanded to be off when it did run], and the ethernet connector [which also failed when the internal adapter failed --- thus the NIC card seems to be de-laminating from the motherboard).ALSO problem was unit was presented as having a CD/DVD drive.  Uh, not quite --- unit only read CDs (and Device Manager concurred --- is NOT a component failure, but is the type of installed component), so I had to purchase a USB DVD drive to install software too big for flash drives.  Also not mentioned, is power switch is finicky.  Sometimes it works, sometimes, not so much.  Actually, when if fails, it will function if I unplug the AC power cord until it turns on and begins reboot.  Then, not trusting battery, I will re-plug the unit into AC power.OVERALL --- would I recommend as a valid laptop, or a backup unit, or a starter unit?  Heck NO Would I recommend it for the purpose for which I bought it?  Heck YES!!!  Darned good super-El-Cheapo unit for sacrificial testing --- and so far it has done what it was purchased for.  If it continues working for another 6 months like this, I could say that \"I'm In Like Flint!\" for this unit.  Would I do something like this again.  YES!!!!

Other then it being little this thing is powerful. I was searching for something affordable for about 2 years in a row and never found nothing that was worth trying but when I ran across this Dell Latitude for only 120 bucks I couldn't resist.I was so nervous the day I received this big ol box by Ups . My husband just looked in shock because I always chance things and they always end up bad lol , but when I did open it and saw how clean it was with not one mark on it we both started getting excited. I then turned to him and kindly said \"we'll now that you seen mines , you better order yourself one because this one is only for my use\"! (I know mean right , but you have to understand why I said it)So going on , I  had to order 2 more the same day.I must say my whole family loves this computer. Especially my son, At night I hear him in his bed room playing music and I have to go in and tell him to turn it down(another plus it can get very loud). One night I even had to take it away from him because I knew If I didn't he would've failed his test the next day. Honestly guys/girls this is really a good purchase. If I had to say anything on a neggitive side this would be my only complaint, NO WEB CAM! That's pretty messed up but I can always go and buy one for 50 bucks . That's a small problem to a giant.

Right away I noticed a huge difference but it was still not fast enough to be my daily computer so I upgraded the ram to 1gb. WOW THIS THING IS BLAZING FAST!!!!! I thought when I was testing the new ram.  But after awhile it still seemed a little slow so I read on-line and found out some cool tricks you can do to Linux to make it faster and after a little work this laptop is just as fast as my quad-core desktop.

I realize its used.  But what a disappointment.  Should have kept saving for new laptop.  I hope the card is the problem and not the mboard to which it attaches.

{"Title":"this is my 2nd tablet pc","Author":"J. Veteran \"tabletlover\"","ReviewID":"R2AJRM2HI3DLSU","Overall":"good","Content":"11-22-2007 Update - my second TX1320US has the same problem as the first one. This model has, in my opinion, a factory defect. Avoid purchasing. The defect is in the wiring harness that goes through the swivel mount and causes audible clicks to sound through the speakers when manipulating the display. You can position the screen so that the clicking repeats like someone playing a snare drum roll repeatedly.  HP blew it big time on this 'tablet' which is not a true tablet, it should be called a 'touch screen laptop' as it has no synaptic pointing device.  I'd downgrade this to a one star but Amazon  has it set up so you cannot change your original rating.  What follows is my original review:This is my second tablet PC. I'd say my experience so far is mixed.  After 12 days of use I'm going to need to exchange it for another one as there is an electrical short in the swivel mount for the screen.  The laptop makes a very loud audible, \"clack clack clack clack\" noise when the screen is positioned at various angles.  The noise comes through the speakers and can be induced or stopped instantaneously by screen angle (tilt the screen 45 degrees towards you as if you were closing the lid and stop - and the noise is heard).I am almost greatful that the screen is acting up because I was disappointed by the response of the space bar in the keyboard. I type 70 wpm and never have an issue hitting 'space'.  However on this keyboard I routinely find that the space bar did not recognize my input forcing me to backspace (as I type this about every 10th space has this issue).My 3rd complaint is the tablet stylus.  I was an early adopter of the tablet, purchasing the very first Toshiba model when they first came out around 2001'ish.  What I noticed immediately about this tablet's stylus is the lack of a spring to the tip.  My first tablet was very responsive to different screen pressures, and it was easy to know how much pressure you were applying to the screen because of the ability to push with varying pressure.  The default stylus that ships with the HP tx1320us is just a piece of plastic with a permanent type of tip. It feels harsh and unresponsive in comparison to my first tablet's stylus.Once my exchange is finished (and should I decide to keep this laptop) I will be looking for an aftermarket tablet stylus which is unfortunate because the docking cradle for this laptops stylus is really well done.The laptop feels quick and responsive within the VISTA OS and the screen resolution is decent.  The fingerprint swiping mechanism really needs an overhaul however because it hurts to drag your finger across it. It has very sharp edges.Overall I'd give this a 3 out of 5 assuming you don't get a lemon like I did.(note I did an 'even exchange' on this laptop and got an identical one.  The new one has a responsive keyboard and no shorts or problems with the swivel display mount.  I did find out though that I will never get the reponsiveness I thought I would get from this tablet due to the fact that the screen is not interactive with the stylus in the way that many tablets are.  A much better name for this laptop would be TOUCH SCREEN laptop NOT Tablet Laptop...Microsoft and HP and screwing up the 'TABLET' branding by allowing this type of device to bear that name).","Date":"November 11, 2007"}

{"Title":"Very Impressive","Author":"R. Layne \"Luv2Read\"","ReviewID":"R2CS4E0IS5MQD5","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm not a gamer so this review may not be helpful to those who want a computer to play games.I have worked as a professional software developer/architect for 17 years.  I started with MSDOS 2.0 and have ridden the Microsoft wave all the way through Vista 64 and I had a few years with UNIX.  I have personally owned or worked with computers from Dell, HP, Compaq, IBM.  I have heard of Apple products but for the most part dismissed them as more toy than tool.  (I was not alone in this perspective.)  I like Microsoft but after working with it for the better part of 20 year I decided to look at something different.I never thought I would purchase an Apple yet here it is.  I am impressed to say the least and I see Apple as a serious tool that also makes a cool toy.Pros:Lightweight - Probably the lightest laptop I've ever worked with or ownedSolid - Normally when you get laptops at 15.4 or larger, chassis flex becomes evident as you can see them bend and they creak.  Yet because of its single piece construction and light weight aluminum the MacBook feels good when you need to move it.  I doesn't creak and there is no noticeable bend when lifted.Battery Life - It just keeps going, and going, and going...  Actually I am seeing up to 4 hours life on the fully charged battery.  My previous computer never surpassed 1.75 hours.Size - It is very thin and carrying it around is very comfortable.  I had a 17\" and while I like the large display its uncomfortable to carry like a book.Magnetic Clasp - When closing the lid the owner is rewarded with a very solid thump instead of a \"creak\" \"clack\" that you hear from so many other laptops that use a plastic display and mechanical clasp.  Opening the monitor is equally a pleasing.  You place you thumb under the lip and lift.  The laptop may slide a little on smooth surfaces but the lid comes up smooth and controlled.Keyboard - This is a great piece of work.  Does it have \"Home\", \"Page Up\", \"Page Down\", the legendary \"Any\" key?  No.  Doesn't need it.  A little research and practice and you will find that these \"missing\" keys are functions of the keyboard and I don't miss them at all.  Secondly the keyboard \"key-float\" (that rattle you hear when you lightly stroke your finger back and forth over a laptop keyboard) is almost completely non-existent.  So when you're typing it doesn't sound like your wadding up crinkly plastic and you don't annoy your neighbors.  The key throw is short but very pleasant.  Another thing I like about the keyboard is that you don't feel like you will break the keyboard if your touch is a little heavy.Display - The display is a work of art.  No only does it look good, but flex has been reduced to almost nothing.  It feels very solid and you don't feel you need to worry about tilting the screen from the corner.  The glass cover over the LED lit LCD display is awesome.  You can actually clean the screen without LCD screen colors distorting.  Not to mention that is automatically dims in low light and the key board lights up in the same low light conditions.  that's a nice touch.  The display brightness is every bit as bright as my desktop LCD display in strong light.Touch Pad - Any who has tried to use the touch pads on other computers (I hate them generally) will love this touch pad.  It works like the iPhone (except scrolling is reversed for obvious reasons - you're not actually touching the screen).  The touch is light and very smooth.  Making the entire touch pad the button is brilliant, it took me almost no time to get use to it and now I nearly push a hole through the Dell touch pad before I realize I have to click the buttons.  I have no trouble with inadvertent touch that moves my cursor away from where I'm typing.Quiet - I have yet to hear the fans.  It makes me wonder if they ever work.DVD Superdrive - Finally!  No cup holder comes sliding out of the side of my laptop.  Just simply slide the disc in and your done.  It operates like the CD player in a car.  It is easy to eject from the screen or a key on the keyboard.Fit and Finish - The best I've ever seen.  The only thing I've seen is a very slight misalignment of the Express Card/34 slot door.  But you really have to look close to see it.Operating System - WOW.  Fast, no anti-virus, stable: it just works.  I won't get too much into the OS but I will say that once I understood how Apple likes things done OS X is very appealing.  Not to mention that it sleeps and wakes up faster than anything I have ever worked with.  Open the monitor and it's sitting there saying \"come on, I'm tired of waiting for you\".Built-in Accelerometers - Not sure what they're good for, but they're cool.  Like the iPhone the MacBook Pro has three accelerometers.  There is an Stanford Laptop Orchestra uses MacBook Pros to make music using these accelerometers.No Fresh Air Openings - I really dislike fresh air ports on the bottom of laptops.  They are easily plugged and they suck fuzz and dust into the heat sinks.  With my previous computers the fresh air ports were placed underneath the computer right where it sets on your legs.  The result was you ran a big risk overheating the computer.  The MacBook Pro pulls the cooling air through the keyboard and therefore has a smooth bottom making it far better to place on you lap.CONS:Chassis - While it is a brilliant piece of engineering there are a couple very minor issues.One:  Always pick the computer up with both hands.  While this is true of all laptops you want to last, it's a little more important with this one.  The metal around the ethernet port has been machined very thin which was necessary to fit the large jack in the rather narrow side of the laptop.  So if you have the monitor open and grab the laptop with you left hand and your thumb over that jack you could dent the metal around it.  It doesn't warp or twist the whole chassis, it's too strong but you could see a small indention in a otherwise straight piece of metal.Two:  The metal in the Battery/Hard Drive Cover is very thin and sometime appears to hang below lip of the chassis.  You really have to look to see it and it isn't all the time.  I don't think is is warped or bent, but just the natural flexibility of aluminum.Touch Pad Click - While I absolutely love the touch pad (in fact I only use a mouse anymore when I am programming on it because of the nature of the software).  If you try to click at the top of the pad (nearest the screen) the force required to click goes up quite a bit.Price? - Not really a Con.  Some have complained about the price.  Three and half years ago I paid $5700 for a Dell 9100 laptop (All the bells and whistles, Window XP Pro, Office Pro, the works).  It has been a great computer that has been put to pasture and my family uses it.  I've only had two problems with it.  The dreaded mexican jumping keys (a key flies off the keyboard after you press it down while typing; AKA broken key) Dell replaced the keyboard without any trouble and the hard drive crashed and needed to be replaced.  The Dell computer when new cost more than twice the MacBook Pro does today and the only thing it has over the Mac (old age and technology not withstanding) is it's 1920 x 1200 pixel display compared to the Mac's 1440 x 900 display.  If I were to order the most power 15.4 laptop Apple sells today, I would still pay half the price of the Dell and the Apple does much more and has better quality overall.To summarize this is an accomplishment that the engineers, designers, and developers should feel proud.  There is some room for improvement but these improvements are at a level that other laptops have to improve a great deal just to achieve Apple's shortcomings.I could go on further but I think this is enough.  Apple has truly developed a great product in both hardware and software and I recommend it highly.","Date":"December 10, 2008"}
{"Title":"Worth the Extra Money Compared to MacBook","Author":"Charles","ReviewID":"RJEIFE17ZKIWV","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple's site and other reviews provide the essential information on what was upgraded in this new MacBook Pro (two graphics systems; machined from solid aluminum; new industry-standard DisplayPort video out; new trackpad; other minor changes/upgrades).But why get this computer rather than the much less expensive MacBook that appears almost identical?1. The MacBook LCD display is poor. It is not just a smaller version of the MacBook Pro LCD display. It has washed-out blacks, poor contrast, limited viewing angles, and less vibrant colors. This is a huge difference. I confirmed this with a side by side comparison in the Apple Store (and the store staff member agreed), and you can find further discussion at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review).2. The MacBook Pro's excellent new graphics chip (NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT) can be used to speed up all operations (not just graphics) when the new Apple operating system (Snow Leopard) is released in January. This is not confirmed, but there is substantial discussion online suggesting this is the case. The 9600M is essentially a 32 processor computer (running at 120 gigaflops). So, a MacBook Pro will actually gain in speed over time. The MacBook does not have a separate graphics card that can work this way.3. MacBook Pro graphics are twice as fast as MacBook graphics, so if you do anything visual with your computer (digital photography, video, games, etc.) then everything will run much more quickly and smoothly. Some games that are just barely playable on the MacBook become fun and seemless on the MacBook Pro.4. The MacBook Pro has a firewire port (omitted from the new MacBook).5. The MacBook Pro has an expansion card slot (really handy for adding a memory card reader or 3G roaming internet).So, for the extra $400 (MacBook 2.4 GHz vs. MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz) you get a lot of extras that you will notice and use. And you will avoid the poor LCD on the MacBook. You are still stuck with the highly-reflective glass screen (if my eyeglasses can get anti-reflective coating, then why not this computer screen?), however, so it's only four stars until they solve that problem.","Date":"October 19, 2008"}
{"Title":"New macbook, new hardware, awesome","Author":"D. Perkins","ReviewID":"R1PXY1HA39YG2Z","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple is notorious for constantly updating their products, more or less to keep up the status quo on their products.  The new Macbook Pro is no exception.  This beautifully constructed laptop is a work of art in many ways in which i will detail.SCREENThe MBP has had a beautiful screen for as long as i can remember and this new model is no exception.  LED lit means that it is \"instant on\".  when you open the lid, there is no warm up time like there is with other screens like LCD ect.  The colors pop and are extremely vibrant and true.  If you have seen an older MBP screen, you've seen them both, kind of.  The new screen is all glass.  The glass extends to the very outer edge of the lid, leaving no empty space.  Simply put, you can't find a better screen, not even on a Sony machine (and i love sony also).KEYBOARDThe new MBP has an updated keyboard.  The first thing you will notice is that the keys are black as apposed to the old silver.  The black adds a nice touch because it accents the silver case.  If you ask me, the old MBP had too much silver.  EVERYTHING on the machine was silver aluminum.  Don't get me wrong, i loved the old MBP, but this is just one step up.  The Keyboard is also backlit so when you are in a darker environment, the keys light up, helping you see anything and everything on the keyboard.  The Keyboard is absolutely beautiful on the machine and adds a nice touch overall to the look.TRACKPADI find it weird that i can put an entire section on a review about a laptops trackpad, but this is undoubtedly necessary.  The new trackpad is ALL glass and there is no button---per say.  In reality the entire trackpad is the button.  They took off the button on the bottom and extended the trackpad down to give you more real estate.  Apple spent months designing this trackpad and i have to give them major credit for that.  recently me and my friend were looking at laptops at Circuit City, and one thing we did was go through every single laptop and look at it's trackpad.  It is absolutely amazing how much time and effort company's DON'T put into designing their trackpad, when in my book, it is a HUGE factor.  The coefficient of friction on this trackpad is exactly what it needs to be.  not too rough, not too smooth, just right.  I absolutely love the MBP trackpad and think it is something apple needs to be commended for.GRAPHICSApple and NVIDIA joined up and came up with a new video card for this MBP.  The MBP actually has 2 graphics cards in it.  One that is integrated, and one that is dedicated.  The integrated graphics is NVIDIA instead of the old intel, so it is immensely better.  The dedicated card (which can be easily switched on) is a powerhouse and almost puts a MBP in line with other gaming machines, almost.  Needless to say, this notebook will do just about whatever you want it to do graphics wise, gaming, video editing, photo editing, you name it, it will do it pretty easily.  no worries here.OVERALLoverall this laptop is at the top of it's class and you might be wondering why i gave it 4 stars and not 5.....first and foremost, money.  I have to say that this is still overpriced.  You are paying for a collection of things like the operating system, graphics card, high end components and things like that, but come on apple, 2000 dollars is a lot to drop on any laptop, no matter what it is.  Is it worth it? without a doubt yes, and that is why apple can jack up their prices, but at the same time, it seems like they are kind of taking advantage of us, especially in the economic slum we're in right now.  Maybe i am just cheap (which i don't think most people would classify me as that) but that seems a little high to me.  And another thing.  what is up with the new display port?  i have a 46 inch samsung tv and i will be hooking it up to my MBP but the cable is 100 dollars!!!! and that is just to dual link dvi----i still have to buy a dual link dvi to HDMI adapter after that. Ugh.  apple (along with other company's...cough cough monster cables) is completely ripping us off on their cables and that makes a difference in my outlook on the big picture.CONCLUSIONThe new MBP is absolutely stunning in every aspect of its design.  Apple continues to wow us, and they will also continue to prosper and grow.  I will be enjoying my new Macbook pro and i hope this review helped you in any questions you might have had.  It is an investment that will live for a long time and will be greatly enjoyed every day.  good job apple.","Date":"October 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"The Good, The Bad, and the Shiny","Author":"Robert M. Brown","ReviewID":"R21IXVOXMC9GO1","Overall":"good","Content":"The new MacBook Pro has some significant advantages over the old one.  The new case design is attractive and solid.  The keyboard is crisp and responsive.  The hard drive is as easy to access as on every other notebook on the market (as opposed to requiring complete disassembly of the machine with the old model).  The new NVIDIA 9600 graphics adds a lot of 3D horsepower.There are some significant drawbacks as well.  The video output for connecting an external monitor is only compatible with one monitor at the moment.  Connecting to the kinds of monitor that people actually own will require the purchase (and carrying) of an additional $30 adapter.  Or two, if you need to connect to both VGA and DVI monitors.The new MacBook Pro actually has two video adapters; the NVIDIA 9400 and 9600.  The system uses the 9400 by default, which is less powerful than the 9600 but uses less power.  The 9400 is an integrated adapter without its own memory; it uses 256MB of the system RAM.  The problem is that it uses that 256MB RAM even when the system is using the 9600 adapter.  In other words, these laptops effectively have 256MB less RAM than the previous generation.The new display is very clear and sharp, at least as good as the previous generation's screen.  It is also covered with a pane of glass and is very, very shiny; much shinier and more reflective even than the previous generation's 'glossy' screen.  If the lighting conditions in your work environment are exactly right, the screen looks wonderful.  If there is any light behind or above you, the screen acts as a mirror and the glare and reflections can be very annoying.The new MacBook Pro is a wonderful computer, but it is not a clear upgrade from the previous version and the mirror finish of the new screen means that no one should buy this computer without actually trying it first.","Date":"October 27, 2008"}
{"Title":"PC to Mac Convert and lovin' it!","Author":"OPsDad \"New Media Consultant\"","ReviewID":"RZVBPREDQN47E","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a long-time IT professional with enough certifications (mostly Microsoft) to make a large can of alphabet soup, and this is my first Mac.  I had played with a few of them here and there years ago, and never saw what people liked about them.  The closest I ever came was back in the late '90s when I was tempted to run Windows on a PPC, but just about the time I was going to do that, Microsoft pulled their support for it from Windows, and that ended that.So, I was anti-Mac for quite a few years.  All that has changed.  I began to believe in the OS when Apple began to base it on Unix.  A solid, time proven technology that I trust.  The big thing that changed it all for me is VMWare.  For 70 dollars, I have the ability to run Vista Ultimate, XP, and Ubuntu Linux on OSX. My Vista Ultimate is my previous Dell (not a slouchy box, either).  It's a complete clone of my old computer.  Windows still shows it being a Dell!  Spooky.  Windows had it a 3.6 rating, and a retest of the VM on my Mac shows a 3.6 rating.  That alone earns 4 of the stars I give this machine.Now, here's another reason why I'm so happy.  I put Office 2008 on the MBP, and I seldom have any reason to even start the Vista VM anymore.  The last two times I did, it was only because I miss the great Vista solitaire game.  That earns the fifth star -- I'm not \"homesick\" in the least.  I think I'll be staying right here on planet Mac.  As a matter of fact, I got a MacBook for my wife, I liked this MBPro MB471LL/A so much!  Bought her the MB403LL/A.I use it with an external monitor about 90 percent of the time, so the glare of the glossy screen hasn't been an issue for me.  The built in screen is gorgeous, and I've not been in a situation where glare became an issue.This machine is truly desktop horsepower in a gorgeous carved aluminum notebook chassis.  I'm a very happy camper.","Date":"November 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"Rus Healy","ReviewID":"R2E6RNZS44RJ92","Overall":"good","Content":"In more more than 25 years as a computer \"power user,\" this is the first Mac I have ever owned. I had never considered Macs to be relevant to me in several key ways, including the proprietary, non-Intel hardware and lots of \"funky things\" about the old Mac OS. However, I had also become dog-tired of the Wintel boondoggle--machines needing to be rebuilt on a regular basis, blue screens, virus hassles, etc, etc. Supporting family computers was even more of a pain. \"Dad, what does this error message mean?!\" <sigh> Clearly Macs are now a viable alternative for technical business users (okay, they have been for a while), so I took the leap even though the hardware is very pricey, competitively speaking.I'm absolutely delighted with this purchase. Everything just works. Although I'm still finding my way around in some areas, I am reveling in the joy of a human-use-oriented user interface. I installed VMware fusion based on my comparisons between it and Parallels, and on my experience with VMware on other platforms. I exported my work machine with VMware Converter and imported it into Fusion. Works great. Performance is at least as good as it was on the old machine (2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM)--and stability is much better. Integration of Windows apps into OS X is excellent using Fusion's Unity mode. I have not had to revert to my work-issued HP laptop even once since making the jump.The only challenge I had, and it was minor, was installing the RAM upgrade. I bought 4 GB RAM at the same time as the machine because I wanted to have the full memory capacity, especially for business apps and VMware Fusion. The upgrade isn't difficult (unlike the Mac Mini!), but it does take some care and two sizes of small screwdrivers to complete. Eight screws have to come out, and four of them are quite small. Take care to keep from dropping any of the smaller screws into the machine when you're reinstalling them. Cover alignment is also important to get just right, or the battery/HDD hatch doesn't close properly. As with any project, put all the screws in before tightening any of them.Unlike other reviewers, I have not found the high-glare, glass display to be a big problem. Glare is sometimes an issue but reorienting the machine slightly minimizes the inconvenience. The display is gorgeous, very much in keeping with the overall product design and quality. The glass trackpad is excellent, with intuitive, tunable multitouch features. The MacBook Pro runs much cooler, and quieter, than any laptop I've used over the last 5 or 6 years as well. The milled aluminum case is both rugged and attractive, as well as providing a great heat sink for the high-heat components.In the wish-list department, I would appreciate having more than two built-in USB ports, although I can migrate at least one device to FireWire to take advantage of that port. Also, the front edge of the base is slightly uncomfortably sharp for resting my hands or wrists. Lastly, I find it annoying to have to buy a $20+ adapter cable to connect an external VGA monitor. The adapter cable is also too short--but this isn't a review of the cable. All that said, these issues are not enough to drop my rating below five stars. This is an outstanding laptop. I like OS X enough that I have already added a Mac Mini as the family machine, to rave reviews among its three primary users. How can you beat that?","Date":"November 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"Go With The Pro!","Author":"Brandie Woodward \"Spock4Pres818\"","ReviewID":"R14GH6D5ZJDBYD","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased the pro yesterday at my local Apple Store.  I have had it for less then 24hrs so far, and I love it.  I was going to get the high end Macbook, and then at the last minute decided on the low end Pro upgraded with 4GB of Memory.  I am so glad I did.  It is so fast, and powerful.  The display is what made me make the final choice.  It is still very portable.  It weighs the same as my black macbook, and is thin.  It would be very easy to just to throw in my backpack and be on my way.  Also the firewire.  It was going to be the easiest way to transfer all my data from my old black macbook to the pro.  It only took and hour and a half, and I have all my information.  I didn't have to do anything, just started it up and began to play.  I didn't have Leopard on my old one, and I love it so far.  It is easy and the graphics and set up are great.  I love the stacks options, and the lighted keyboard.  I also love how the controls for the dashboard, screen brightness, keyboard brightness, and dvd controls, are right on the keyboard.  I was in between which laptop to get also because I am a casual gamer.  However, the salesman did tell me that I could still play some of the games on the Macbook.  The display alone is what I am enjoying the most.  It is definitely worth the extra money to get the pro.  Highly Recommended!  I didn't get it from Amazon, or order it.  I wanted to look at the computer before I purchased it.  From reading all the horror stories on the web about people receiving damaged, or broken laptops from both the Apple Store and other retail stores.  I would also recommend if you are going to get a mac, go to the Apple Store itself and get one if possible.  They are so helpful, and usually give you some kind of deal when purchasing one.  They will also set it up for you, but transferring all your information to your new computer is very easy to do by yourself.","Date":"November 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Switching From a PC to a 17\" MacBook Z0G5 128GB SSD","Author":"John Robertson","ReviewID":"RPYM6PU8IIAXD","Overall":"good","Content":"As of this writing, I've noticed that Amazon is mixing all MacBook Pro reviews together, regardless of the model you searched on to get here.  This is for the Z0G5, which is really just the 2.66GHz MB604LL 17\" with the 128GB Solid State Drive option.  Although I have used Apple/Mac products over the years, this is the first time an Apple has been my number 1 computing device.  I'm including details for those used to the PC environment, so those already familiar with Apple, please be patient, as I wanted to help weigh the pros and cons of switching from Windows.SUMMARY=======This, quite simply, is the nicest computer I have ever owned or used since starting with them in 1979.  It is not for everybody, if only because of price, but if there is something you are used to doing on Windows XP or Vista, this will probably do it, and do it faster and more reliably.GOOD====* Bootup/shutdown times - benchmarks are somewhat relative, but my 6 year old HP ze5400 P4, and 5 month old dv7-1130 core-duo, both will boot XP Pro to a usable state in just over 4 minutes, including effects of anti-virus software and initial browser launch.  Using the same licensed copy of XP Pro for this MBP, it boots in an incredible 25 seconds, every time.  This latter time is a full boot-up -- no hour glasses to wait through.  Shutdowns average around 4 seconds on the MBP, compared to around 30 to 45 seconds on the above mentioned Windows laptops.  You can also run Vista32/64, Linux, Unix, Sun and other OS using VMware Fusion, which runs within the Leopard OS -- this is absolutely terrific software, and if you set it to full screen, you will be hard pressed to tell if you are running a pure Windows OS, although Fusion will only devote one of the two Intel cores to Windows.  This latter point is quite amazing, when you read about how fast Vista boots on other MBP's (see other Amazon reviews in April 2009).  You can allocate the majority of the included 4GB of RAM and almost as much as the hard drive/SSD to these guest OS' as you want.  For just Leopard, the native OS, boot and shutdown times are comparable, and of course, that's for just that OS -- it has nothing to do with Fusion or guest OS's.* Screen - having just come from a near-new HP dv7-1130us, which also has a glossy 17\" screen, well, there is simply no comparison.  I'm not being an \"Apple snob\" here.  The MBP offers a much sharper and more colorful image.  Personally, the occasional glare is a worthwhile trade-off for the image quality, but I spent almost 2 hours in a local Apple store comparing the glossy vs. anti-glare side-by-side, and I almost picked the anti-glare, extra $[...] cost notwithstanding.  Unless you are really concerned about the final few pixels of 130dpi resolution which the glossy screen seems to bring out, or the pop-out color of the glossy, the anti-glare is just as good, and almost fully eliminates any trace of glare.  I could have been happy with either.  Also, when running XP in VMware Fusion, you can set the screen resolution to a ridiculous 5210 x 3200 ! (not native of course, but the even the 1920x1200 is better than any WSXGA+ screen I'm aware of)*  Battery power - I've only run on battery for 4 hours at a time, but I would estimate usable power for up to 6 hours, with occasional wifi use and uninterrupted word processing.  I do think it's POSSIBLE to get the 8 hr time, particularly if you get the flash hard drive and 2.66GHz processor, but you have to allow all power saving options, reduce screen brightness to absolute minimum, etc, so that practically, this is just a laboratory spec.  However, I have never owned a laptop that did better than 3 hours -- so this doubled that.* Keyboard -  I have come to really like the keyboard in only two weeks, although I do miss having a backspace key.  Apple die-hards may know something I don't, but without backspace or an 'end' key, I find I am re-positioning the cursor a lot.  However, the track pad almost compensates for this.  When set for single-tap, this is the best track pad I've ever used.  I never accidentally select or click items anymore.  Right click is done with two-fingers, and is less effort than actual 'right-clicking'.  Windows hotkeys, such as alt-tab, ctrl c, ctrl v, etc. work when running XP.  I dislike the sharp edge towards the front of the laptop, and I'm a little surprised that Apple picked form over razor-blade-function by not beveling this.  But, this thing is a MacBook Air wannabe - it is very thin, and the pressure on the wrists still isn't as bad as other laptops I have used.  Too bad they didn't round it like the bottom edge.* SSD speed and response - currently, going to the Solid State Drive (NAND flash memory) is a $[...] premium to a 7200RPM hard drive, and that only gets you 128GB, of which you will have around 93 usable GB after getting your Mac with Leopard, iLife (included) and in my case, iWork loaded on it.  I keep photos and large files on a couple of external HDD's, and use an online backup service for really important business files, so trading off speed to lower capacity was very worthwhile.  In fact, I'm getting in the bad habit of not shutting down, but just putting the MBP to sleep and stuffing it in my bag while it's saving files -- it doesn't matter with SSD.  I've read about benchmarking SSD to HDD, small files vs big files, etc, etc.  Frankly, it was all meaningless once using it for real.  It's expensive now, but in 5 years, we will all be using SSD.* iWork and TextEdit - these will open .doc, .xls, .xlsx, etc.  You may not be able to edit all the features of Windows productivity software using Apple's own versions on their own, but you can still do many things with iWork, and you can always view any Microsoft-format files.  I was stunned at some of iWork's templates in Pages and Numbers.* You can share files between the Leopard and Windows OS (or any other guest OS) using shared folders.  You can also select to share files between different users or not.  This reminded me of using LAN shares.* Blue screen?  What's that??  Cheekiness aside, I can lock a Mac if I really try, but I have not done so yet on this or it's guest XP Pro OS.  Just a pleasure to use.NOT AS GOOD===========* 2.66GHz vs 2.93GHz for an extra $[...] - I'm being a little less than objective here, but looking at bench marks for the MacPro desktop, and talking with Apple Genius reps, I concluded the 2.93GHz processor only adds about 5 to 7% more usable processing power.  Feel free to offer your opinion.* Occasional lag - this has happened 3 times in two weeks -  I think this is due to the guest OS and tear-down of memory ranges.  It's not that obtrusive, but after getting used to the normal speed of the laptop, it's a bit of a surprise when it does happen.* Trash bin - no restore.  I have researched this and as incredible as it will sound to Windows users, you must manually restore unintended deletions yourself to whatever folder it came from -- not very helpful if you were typing/swiping quickly and didn't see where you unintentionally deleted something, or you are unfamiliar with Mac directory trees.  I have read some borderline-snob opinions about this, but it's a serious oversight that should not be joked about.  Most of us can identify with your hands tiring and inadvertently dragging a file or folder to the Trash.  Or sometimes small creatures known as children get a-hold of your treasured, $[...] device and use it as a Fisher-Price xylophone set.  I've been around some very brainy, Product Development Engineering-Fellow-types for years, and they are sometimes guilty of convincing themselves that removing features like this are explainable, acceptable, and only weak or stupid people would ever complain.  I guess I'm weak and stupid.  Frankly, I don't care.  Stupid people still seem to have a lot of money, (more than average, I have observed) so unless Apple likes perpetual 12% market-share, they should and will have to match certain, select attributes offered by competitors.  Again, if I'm wrong, I'd welcome being set straight on the issue.* Caution: Slippery When Dry - dry hands may not always grasp the super clean, smooth aluminum case, such as when going through airport X-ray security with hundreds of people jostling you.  I purchased the 3 year warranty because of this (although damage in such circumstances still may not be covered).* Warranty - at $[...], it's a little expensive.  I didn't know this when purchasing, but if you buy a 24\" monitor with the MBP on the same invoice, then the warranty also covers the monitor.  Except that, by definition, if you don't buy a monitor, then you're overpaying for a warranty that was priced to include one.* You may need new hardware and/or software - much of it which is not cheap.  One reason why VMware Fusion is so wonderful is you can load Window-based apps like Office and use your existing license.  Apple currently throws in iLife, and if using only Leopard, you don't typically need anti-virus software.  Some Apple hardware, like RAM, is designed only for Apple computers and does cost more -- even if you buy it from a third-party retailer.* ExpressCard 34 port - I really will need an eSATA port.  Unfortunately, reading some Apple reviews indicate that many commonly-available Express34 eSATA adapter drivers currently do not work reliably with the MBP.  I normally don't put too much into a few bad reviews here and there, but this does seem to be a genuine problem with the MBP as of late April 2009.  Driver updates may correct.* Price - it has to be said:  This is still just a computer.  Once you add truly comparable hardware, the price difference is not quite as disparate as many believe...perhaps $[...] for a premium, all-flash, all-day-battery Windows laptop to a $[...] MBP.  It's easy to fall into a trap of just counting USB ports, of how much DDR3 RAM you get, but I'm also referring to native screen resolution for a portable device, or color balance, stability, security vulnerability, etc.  If the MBP advantages are worth it to you, chances are you already know. I just broke the TFT display on my 5 month old HP dv7-1130us laptop, which also had a dual-core, 4GB DDR3 RAM, etc., which lead to this MBP purchase, but believe me -- and I'm not trying to jump onto an anti-Vista kick here -- the PC was painful to use.  Slow, alarmingly buggy, and poor legacy support.  Even after downgrading it to XP and upgrading to a 7200RPM HDD, performance was still slow slow - slower than an old single core, P4 with 1GB DDR RAM.  Specs aren't going to show you how fast this MBP boots.SOME FINAL THOUGHTS===================Use the MacBook Pro a little bit, and it grows on you all the more.  It seems different, but familiar hot keys, print screen, display and wifi settings, etc. are all still there.Apple still reminds me of how computers used to be in the 1980's -- things are already laid-out for you, and you do it the Apple way, and if you don't like it, get used to it.  PC, which really was a semi-open standard that began with Microsoft OS running of IBM PC's and PC clones, could be configured many ways.  Like so many things, what makes it open also makes it complicated, with clashing interpretations of standards.  Testing keeps systems reliable, but it is always the most expensive part of developing anything (I know, I can thank my career for it).  As a result, testing is usually where cost-cutting must be performed. Next time you curse Vista, remember, Microsoft engineers cannot solve issues due to third-party designers.  They will always be in reactive mode because Windows is relatively open.Apple chose to make the day-to-day settings for you, and telling many peripheral designers \"here's how your printer WILL talk to our computers\", etc.  It's potentially less flexible, and will slow third-party software and hardware development because it is more expensive to design and test with Apple.  Ironically, this is disorienting to us Windows users.  We are so used to controlling and setting everything, that an Apple computer seems too simple, and even that control is lost.  This really isn't the case though.  Virtually everything you can set in Windows can be manually set in a Mac.  But what I've found over the last 2 weeks is, why would you want to keep adjusting anymore?  I know it's their current slogan, so apologies, but the Apple really \"just works\".  There's no need to get into setup menus -- set once and forget.The last time I used iMac G3's or the original MacIntosh, I enjoyed them and remembered a few of my former PC-peers who said they would never switch back to a PC.  I'm not quite sure I'm ready to say that yet, but the MacBook Pro 17\" is the first Apple computer I'm willing to test that notion on.UPDATE:  Sept 15, 2009======================This is just a fantastic computer.  This is what impresses me almost daily:* Speed.  Same boot-up/turn-off times.  It does not gradually slow down with use like Windows.  Leopard and now Snow Leopard respond very fast. Running XP in the virtual is awesome because I almost never shut-down....I just suspend it.  In doing so, XP basically restarts in seconds.* Display -- Love using screen capture (command, shift, 4) -- much better than Print Screen.* RapidWeaver, Pages, Numbers - awesome templates.  Nice alternatives to the familiar ones we've seen for 10 years.* Ease of updates - fast, automatic and they do not bog machine down while loading.  They also are not co-dependent or prerequisite.  They just all download and install at once.* Battery life.  On just Leopard, 1/2 brightness screen, working on say a website while listening to iTunes, I get an honest 6 hours.  You probably could get 8 hours as I once got 7, but that's the dimmest setting and running only 1 app.  Still, I never take my adapter for the day.  The batteries outlast me.* Time machine is actually pretty cool.  I quite a back-up hound, and had just done what I always did with manual dragging of files to an external drive but TM works very well.Occasionally, there are problems, though in all honesty they do not cause much grief...but in the interest of disclosure, here's what I've found:* About 1 or 2 times per month, I have to Force Quit something.  Problem is usually seems due to a 3rd party driver or app.* Creating a new folder places it at the root of the directory tree, not in a subfolder you've highlighted.* No FW400 port.  I'm not sure...maybe there's an FW800-to-400 adapter.  But I could have used this a few times now.* Could not find a way to reverse the data series on a Numbers graph.  Geniuses at Mac store couldn't figure it out either.  There might be a way (in fact, it's there buy greyed-out...why??).* I dont' like iTunes lack of Realplayer-format support like .ra and .rmj, and greatly wish I could just see a directory tree of songs that I can shift-right-click and select.I don't know how Windows 7 will compare yet.  While it's still important for me to have the legacy support of XP on VM Fusion, I find that I'm using it less and less, almost completely relying on speedy Snow Leopard, Numbers, Word, TextEdit and Preview.  Dialog boxes are also rare (mercifully).  If you are really watching money (which would include 99% of us), obviously you'll have to wonder about those $[...] HP laptop blowouts you see.  However, after just playing around with the dv7 or my friend's HP d8000, I would really recommend you try a small MBP 13.3 or 15\" and at least compare, although it still does take time to learn certain keystrokes and features if you're only a Windows person.  Personally, though, I'm hooked.  I don't think I could go back to a plastic, bendable and slow laptop again.","Date":"April 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"Macbook Pro/Leopard convert","Author":"JJ Casas \"jjcasas.me\"","ReviewID":"R37LR6ZSNJJNKT","Overall":"good","Content":"Finally took the bite and bought my first Apple computer. I'm a photographer and needed a new laptop since my old Gateway one was slowing down.. and since I've been eyeing an Apple since then, I finally purchased one after seeing the new one [I'm writing the review using it right now.]First things first: it just works. No clutter, no unnecessary backgrounds running in the background, simple and definitely sleek. I'm still getting use to the file management since it is different but otherwise, a lot of the programs I've used on Windows are available on Mac.:Design:It's really light for a 15\" laptop! And definitely thin too.. although it's not a cutting edge Macbook Air thin, it's definitely thin enough for easier transport. The all aluminum design is stunning. It's solid and feels sturdy. The keyboard is just right with its chiclet style keys and has enough tactile feedback.. not too loud either.:Screen:It's glossy and yes there is glare. Since I do photography, it's probably not the best screen to edit on but the colors and text and all is really good. It's a bright screen and makes pictures just look good.. too good as a matter of fact [opinion shared with another photography Joe McNally].:Trackpad:It's weird at first but it's really like a regular trackpad.. you place your hand as if on old trackpad and you'll naturally figure it out. Nothing really different but the space of the trackpad is really generous and I'm sure other manufacturers will follow suit.:Performance:I've yet to get bogged down after running Photoshop CS4, Lightroom, iTunes, and Firefox at the same time. So I have no issues just yet and will see later on if I'll need to upgrade to 4gb since I have the standard lower end version of the Macbook Pro.Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase and i'm sure this will last me quite a bit since I've had my Gateway [tablet] for over 2 years.","Date":"December 1, 2008"}
{"Title":"Beautiful computer, some mixed feelings","Author":"Jacek R. Ambroziak","ReviewID":"R1P8JNZVCBFHR7","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Apple computer ever. I am a software developer who mostly used Unix (Solaris) and Linux, rarely venturing into Windows land mostly for Nikon Scan and Photoshop. For a long time I believed Macs were for graphics/video designers, rather than hard core developers. The fact that I've seen lots of MacBooks at conferences such as Web 2.0 in SF, did not convince me enough: I attributed the widespread use of them to a fad, a certain \"style\" as in clothing. For me a computer is a \"knowledge worker's tool\" not a fashion statement. Another reason to stay away from Apple products has been high margin pricing. CPUs, GPUs, memory, disks, are quickly getting cheaper, and yet Apple sells these commodities like luxury goods. One can configure a beautiful Lenovo laptop with more horsepower for much cheaper (I've done it recently for a friend).So why do it?Here are MY reasons. 1) I needed MAC OS X to port some of my applications to the Mac, maybe go into iPhone development too. 2) I needed *some* laptop (for mobility) to replace my historic trusty Dell Inspiron 8000. Most of my work happens on a custom built desktop. 3) I am not much of a Windows fan and I am a bit tired of Linuxes; I wanted inspiration from something I haven't used before: to learn and expand knowledge/experience horizons.So that's where I am coming from...After 3 weeks of usage I can say the following (you will notice the mixed feelings from the title of this review)This is a computer of *stunning* beauty! It is a work of art: the screen, the keyboard, the body; it belongs on a permanent exibition at the MoMA. As such it is a joy to use and have around, it brightens my daily experience. And yet... why such a small screen resolution (1440x900) for a 15 inch screen?! Even my historic Dell from 2001 sported 1600x1200, great for working with text and hi-res photos. For this kind of money we should be getting higher resolution. I am not talking about numbers for numbers' sake: the font characters (even as I write this) are far from print quality, issues with anti-aliasing software may have something to do with this. Within the first couple of hours I practically decided to return the laptop because of how text looks 70% of the time. It is difficult to understand why Apple is saving on pixels here and impairs an otherwise great product. Is it because higher resolutions are reserved for even pricier models? Apart from the not-so-great-a-resolution (you may google around for other people's opinions on that), pricing is somewhat annoying too (and also discussed in many places on the Web). To connect an external monitor you need a $30 or $100 additional cable. To upgrade to a much more reasonable 4GB of RAM you'll need $100+ (or $300 if you want this commodity to have Apple sign on it :-) )But... I decided to keep the laptop. It is too beautiful, and I find MAC OS \"Leopard\" intriguing and a good experience. Then there are other pluses: the keyboard (back-lit w/ smooth key action), great network connectivity, convenient weight and dimensions, glossy screen (I don't have issues with reflections other reviewers mention). From the developer's perspective, I learn some good things and some not so good: apparently I can't just download my Java from Sun (say 32-bit Java 6); I have to live with what Apple endorses :-(Amazon/UPS delivery was fantastic, packaging is beautiful too: they both made for a very pleasant and exciting experience.Summary: I am not returning the laptop, I enjoy its beauty and functionality, but if I didn't need MAC OS for my planned work, I would have stayed in the higher value priced PC-land (eg. Lenovo + Ubuntu) where you can customize parameters better and avoid hefty margins.A FEW DAYS LATER: With MiniDisplayPort to DVI adapter (another $30) I connected the laptop to my 1600x1200 Sony LCD monitor. The text characters can still look pretty bad, eg. equals sign = with grey area between the horizontal segments. The bad news is that the higher resolution did not heal the issue: the good news: perhaps this is a software issue to be solved with a system update -- I hope.","Date":"January 8, 2009"}
{"Title":"They finally converted me - Bye bye Vista","Author":"TN_legend","ReviewID":"RLK6OYNPQ09PD","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Mac - Ok let me start by saying I had been an Anti-Apple for years, I also work in IT and work a lot with Microsoft products still. So you wanna know what happened? Vista happened, as a big ex-Microsoft fan I bought a new laptop(HP) the week vista was released - I am not a new user so I understood there will be bugs and I need to give it time, same thing happened when they released Windows XP. ok after 1 + year of vista:  Man, system was still SLOW, ok no big deal added 2 more GB of memory but its still SLOW, programs not responding, and a security pop up pretty much for everything I tried to do. You click on a short cut and wait and wait and wait and finally it opens now the program is not responding so you have to wait and wait and wait. LIFE IS TOO SHORT!!! Then I heard Microsoft is releasing Windows 7, I was kinda pissed, I just spent $$ to upgrade to vista ultimate and now they are releasing a new windows?? that quick?? Fine so I went to Microsoft.com and get into Windows 7 beta. in the mean time I always owned blackberrys phones and it was the time to upgrade my old phone (blackberry curve), looked at the blackberry storm and man that thing stinks comparing it to the Iphone so I gave up and bought an Iphone - and WOW what a great experience I have had with it, the phone is just great and the APP store alone beats any phone out there - anyways going back to Windows 7 - Ok Microsoft can fool people naming it windows 7 but its Vista with some changes to the interface, same problems , very slow, and more system requirements than vista so basically if I want to experience Windows 7 at its best I have to buy a new laptop with a better graphic card. I then looked at the new Mac OS requirements - Yeah 256 MB of memory, you know what does that mean? it means people who bought an apple in 2000 can run the latest OS while for me to run Windows 7 I have to buy a new laptop that is less than 2 years old, same thing when vista was released couldn't run vista on a 2 years old Dell so had to buy a new laptop. that did it for me - I was done and decided to switch to mac and oh my god what a different experience I have had - It just AMAZING, I love every second of it - the system is so quit its hard to tell its running, it doesn't get hot like HP/dell did, the battery actually last longer than 2 hours. its just what a laptop should be like and the mac experience is as good as it could get, you turn this laptop on and the start time is less than 1 minute - you click on a short cut and the program runs immediately - I can run 9 different programs on it at the same time and not notice any slowness - try that with vista and you will see a nice blue screen + and no need to worry about virus or spyware.Yes this machine was more expensive but you know what? you really get what you pay for. Go to an Apple store and try a mac if you think about switching, trust me - you won't be sorry and you would never look back","Date":"April 1, 2009"}
{"Title":"Amazing but not without it's flaws, those hoping to use bootcamp for Windows may be disappointed.","Author":"TeamReveal","ReviewID":"RNYSSVR6Z6XHH","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my very first Macintosh computer. Earlier this year I bought an iPod Touch and I felt and still feel it is the most amazing pocketable gadget around, so since I was in need of a new computer I became highly interested in buying my first Apple computer and I went with the Late '08 Macbook Pro.After a month of daily usage I think I've had enough time to form an unbiased opinion of the computer's achievements and shortcomings.The first thing you'll notice is that the Macbook Pro's glass display is understatedly amazing. There is something about the glass enclosure that gives everything a certain purity. All screens have some type of film over them, whether that be gloss, matt, or simply a glass enclosure. Each of these films have a different refractive index of light and thus look different. What that means is that even if a manufacturer uses the same exact screen, the quality of the screen will be affected by what type of film protection they use.The Macbook Pro's screen is super bright if needed, and whites are blinding white while blacks are deep and rich. Colors come off as appearing very rich and watching blu-ray movies is a real treat (yes you read that right, more on that later) The viewing angles are also better than most laptops, but like any TN panel they are limited. Comparing this screen to my 2 year old Toshiba Satellite's screen shows that the Macbook Pro isn't as good at dithering colors. If I head over to the Lagom LCD test website, my Toshiba shows all of the steps in contrast for the various colors while the Macbook Pro blends in the last 2-3 squares. For daily average use and movie watching the Macbook Pro is easily king, there's no competition between the two so I'm not saying the Toshiba is better but it does dither colors better. This may be important to you if you are looking to do important detailed photograph work on the Macbook Pro, but then again I don't know of any professional who would do important work on any laptop screen.After a  month I feel pretty comfortable in OS X and I can definitely see why some people love it so much. The way OS X maximizes a screen to optimal width is superior to windows way of needlessly filling the entire screen. It did take a week or so to grow accustomed to this as I constantly wanted to fill the entire screen for no real reason, windows habit. Now I wish windows would maximize windows the way OS X does. I also love the fact that I can visit websites in safari without worrying about getting hit with a virus. In Windows I was constantly worried about visiting unknown sites because I didn't know if they had malicious code in them. More than once in Windows was I hit with messages from my virus scanner warning me that a website was trying to install malicious software. In Windows you have to \"browse defensively\" while in OS X you just have to worry about not downloading and installing malicious software. As far as the rest of the OS X GUI experience, I do feel that it is better than Windows but really, I don't feel there is anything wrong with Windows.If you're an unknowledgeable computer user who constantly has problems because of viruses then I believe you should get a Macintosh because in my experience most computer problems are virus related, something OS X is almost immune too. Personally, I'm a fairly knowledgeable computer user and have never actually had a virus in my computer, the closest is being warned by my virus scanner that a website was trying to install malicious software.Going back to hardware the Macbook Pro is an amazing engineering feat but you do pay for it. It is possible to get the same basic internal hardware for hundreds of dollars less. When I say same basic internal hardware I refer to the CPU and GPU which determine the performance, how fast, your computer can run. There are features in the Macbook Pro that you will not find in other notebooks. The magsafe power adapter is a neat feature, I absolute love the trackpad in OS X (hate it in Windows, but more on that later). Engineering the laptop to fit in an enclosure that's less than an inch thin is unnecessary and so is building it from a single piece of aluminum. No other manufacturer packs so much power in such a small and light frame because of the cost involved. It's these types of details that drive the price of the Macbook Pro up, but it's these details that ultimately lead the Macbook Pro to look and feel like a luxury laptop. You can buy a Toyota or you can buy a Lexus for much more. They both accomplish the same tasks but one delivers it in more style and luxury. If you're looking for the most raw power for your dollar then the Macbook Pro will disappoint but if you're looking for a laptop that looks and feels luxurious then you are in the right place.Now back to software and some of my disappointment with the Macbook Pro and OS X. I'm starting an online masters program this coming Spring and a website called Angel is not supported in Safari which means I'll have to log in to Windows to use it. They will also be using a few Windows only applications which means more Windows. I will also have to turn in assignments in under Microsoft's Word and Excel extensions and as I previously only used windows my copy of Microsoft Office is for Windows only so I'll most likely have to incur another expense and buy this for OS X. I have bought VMWare so I can run Windows within OS X but I am a bit disappointed with its sluggish performance.  I also like watching blu-ray movies, this works under boot camp and by hooking up an external blu-ray player, playing video games is also another windows activity. Sure you can play games under OS X but Windows is superior for game availability and performance. One unexpected disappointment is that I feel OS X's font smoothing is not as good as Windows. Text in Windows looks sharper and is easier on my eyes, I've change some settings in OS X's appearance tab to improve things but I feel text looks better in Windows. Some people tell me they feel text is easier on the eyes in OS X for them so this will be a very personal preference for you.So why did I buy a Mac when I needed to do so many windows only activities? One is because I was enamored with the iPod Touch's abilities and because of the amazing screen on the Macbook Pro. Most importantly, I was hoping to run Windows on the Macbook Pro just like I would on any non-Apple laptop. While you can run Windows under boot-camp it is not an ideal experience. For one the notebook runs very hot under windows. In OS X using the 9400m the notebook barely even gets warm, using the 9600m in OS X the notebook does get warm, but in Windows you can only use the 9600m and the notebook gets not warm, but very hot. You can feel the heat coming off the notebook as you type and it is a little uncomfortable. Metals have a low specific heat capacity (a term for us chemistry nerds) so since almost the entire notebook is made from aluminum you really feel the heat coming off.Also, the trackpad in Windows is trash. Often times I have to click 3-4 times for it to register the command, right clicking barely works. Enabling \"tap to click\" helps the clicking matter a lot but then you get the problem of accidently clicking by accident when you type. The trackpad is a big generous size but that means your palm will rub against it. In OS X the software is smart and knows when your typing so it ignores your palm rubbing against the trackpad and has not been a problem, not even one incident. In Windows I'll get accidental input several times in just a paragraph. While you type you'll all of a sudden delete a paragraph or a word somewhere because it accidentally registered a click and a highlight somewhere. Disabling \"tap to click\" is the only way to remedy this problem and connecting an external mouse is the only way to avoid punching your fist through your screen.Another problem is that you can't completely turn off the backlit keyboard under windows. A third problem is that the wireless card interferes with the sound card. Windows checks for new better wireless connections every 60 seconds and every time windows does this you get a sound crackle through your speakers (external or headphones) and a lag spike (terrible if you're playing online video games). Install a program called Vista Anti-Lag mostly solves this but not entirely. When I'm watching a movie I simply disable the wireless card to avoid sound crackling.All of these issues except the heat issue is a driver problem and something Apple can fix by writing proper software for its hardware in Windows. Apple actively advertises boot camp and the ability to run Windows on their computers so I feel it's only fair they properly support their hardware under Windows.  I follow forums quite a bit and I'm not the only user experiencing some of these problems. Apple so far has said it's not a big enough issue to bother solving. I wasn't aware of all of these issues under windows, but had I known of them I might not have ordered the Macbook Pro because as I stated before I simply don't have the option to not use Windows anymore. Face it, it's a Windows world we live in.Another thing I realized after buying a Macbook Pro is that you really are at the mercy of Apple when you join the Macintosh side. With Windows you have a large amount of notebooks to choose from. Don't like HP's notebooks? No problem you have at least a dozen manufacturers to choose from. Also, being in a Windows world means it'll be unlikely to come across software that is Macintosh only without a Windows alternative, not true the other way around. What brought all of this to my mind was when I first saw a Macbook next to a Macbook Pro. The screen on the Macbook is trash. It looks washed out and the colors are anything but vibrant. The Macbook Air on the other hand has a very nice screen, why Apple can't put that screen in the Macbook baffles me. Comparing the Macbook to windows laptops in a Best Buy stored shows that windows laptops costing half of what a Macbook costs had screens that were vast superior. What this means is that if you are in the Macintosh camp and you want a laptop with a nice screen you only have the choice of the expensive Macbook Pro. On the other hand if you are on a tighter budget the Windows world can offer you a nice screen at a low price. Switching from one operating system to another isn't easy either when you invest in software.On a bit of a side note, the first notebook  I received from Amazon came with a faulty superdrive but returning it was easy. I don't think this is a real big deal because all manufacturers will produce a few notebooks that are faulty, but I thought I should mention it.If you don't need to use Windows often and really want a luxury laptop then I think you'll really love the Macbook Pro. If you need to use windows often and can deal with a bit of slow performance under a virtualizing software like VMware then you should be happy as well. But if you need to use Windows often and need performance (even low intensity applications like Microsoft Word are a bit sluggish under VMware) then you should think long and hard about buying a Macbook Pro. Don't expect a windows experience as good as a dedicated windows system.Still I gave the Macbook Pro four stars. Overall I do find it to be an amazing experience under OS X but I hope software support increases or at least that Apple gets it's act together and offers better drivers for windows. I think the day that you no longer need to use Windows to accomplish a task for work or school is the day to mark the history books as the fall of Microsoft.","Date":"December 14, 2008"}
{"Title":"Very elegant and powerful","Author":"Ron Miller","ReviewID":"R3IYXYLC3FX8MQ","Overall":"good","Content":"My 5 year old 17\" Powerbook G4 was showing signs of age so I decided to move up to an Intel based MacBook Pro. Additionally, as a Mac developer, I needed an Intel mac to update my apps to Universal Binary.I have been a Mac user since the G3 days so have a wide base of comparison. I still have 4 Macs in use in the house. Anyhow, this MacBook Pro is the best of the lot by far, well not by far compared to the 17\" Powerbook but still much better.I was a little concerned about comments re the glossy screen. No problem! It clarifies screen images, and protects as well. The black bezel acts as a frame that contrasts and brings out the beauty of screen images.The black keys and the back lighting system works wonderfully in this machine update. Positive comments about processor speed, the two video cards, the multi-finger track pad set up and the elegance of OSX 10.5.6 can be found in many other reviews. Additionally, the machine is very quiet and runs cool except for the most arduous computing using the 2 video card option.My only disappointment is after using a 17\" sreen for 5 years, the 15\" screen seems a bit tiny-but is is so much lighter the tradeoff is worth it.I highly recommend this product for both the professional and the casual user.","Date":"February 21, 2009"}

{"Title":"Stellar build quality, Superb software","Author":"terrance005 \"terrance005\"","ReviewID":"R3DXX5I7FDOLW9","Overall":"good","Content":"The unibody construction definitely adds to this notebook's durability and reliability.(Actually, it's 4.5 stars, but there are no half stars.)The keyboard takes a couple days to get used to, and then you realize you can type on it at normal speed.  It does not feel mushy.Yes it comes with Firewire, which has been dropped from the unibody Macbooks.  No doubt because USB 3 is going to come to the industry and that is rated at 10 times the speed of USB 2.  This, and the more Apple uses industry-standard components the cheaper they can make their products.  Still a bit sad though, cause Firewire is actually superior.iLife (included software) is GREAT (photo management, make movies, create music and learn to play an instrument, publish and manage websites).iWork (purchased separately) is a refreshingly elegant, and more user-friendly re-think of wordprocessing and page layout, spreadsheet, and presentation software.  Note that Apple Mail comes with the machine.  You don't need to buy iWork to get e-mail software.  A Windows PC often does not come with Microsoft Outlook- you have to buy that or MS Office separately or use the free e-mail software called Thunderbird.The integration, seamlessness, and ease of use set the Mac apart and ultimately make you more productive.  (Far more productive than any difference in Gigahertz with a Windows machine.)  I used Microsoft Windows for 12 years and will not go back.  This is a superior platform with far fewer glitches, weird things, and security/virus/spyware issues.  Most Apple software you can use without buying a big book on Amazon on how to use them. [The money that some people save on buying a PC, often goes towards buying software similar to what comes BUILT-IN on a MAC, or to software for securing the machine (e.g. Trend Micro, Norton Antivirus), or speeding it up (e.g. Diskeeper disk defragmenter).  Furthermore, the security software on a PC often reduces performance by 10-20%.]I get about 2.5 hours battery life typically, and though that is about normal for notebooks (in general) with my kind of activity, (web, music, e-mail, movies, wireless) it really is not enough.  6 hours would be very good, and *8 would be perfect*.  I hardly use the DVD superdrive (about 10 times last year), and would MUCH PREFER IF APPLE USED A BUILT-IN BATTERY (like the MacBook Air or the new 17-inch MacBook Pro)  AND, THAT THEY REPLACE THE OPTICAL DRIVE WITH MORE BATTERY.  The MacBook Air has this, but is a no-go for me because of the smaller screen and resolution, and the 17\" is *for me* too big for lots of lugging around or use on a plane in Economy class.  As long as Apple bundles an external slim optical drive with the system, many people should be fine.*Aside*:  We should actually be getting physical content on Secure Digital (SD) Cards, and  SDHC (SD High Capacity).  Mechanical optical drives are so last century... including Blu-Ray.  Noise, scratched disks, skipping, misaligned heads... all those problems disappear.  It's a monumental shift like going from VHS to DVD.  Those little cards like what go in a camera can replace CDs, DVDs, AND Blu-Ray.  Imagine just slipping one of those into the side of a TV in order to watch a movie.  No need for separate Blu-Ray players and cabling, and this method uses far LESS ENERGY.  I really think this can be done... more and more people's content is purchased and downloaded or streamed anyway.  And an SDHC reader can be inserted into the ExpressCard slot of the MacBook Pro, further eliminating the need for an external optical drive.To reduce heat, noise,  and increase battery life and ruggedness, I am also eager for them to use Solid-State (no moving parts) Drives as standard on all MacBooks instead of mechanical hard drives.  However, you can get it now as an option.  If you have the money, get it (128 GB is available for the 15-inch; and 256 GB, or 128 GB are available for the 17-inch.)Make sure to cover your bases and get the Extended 3-year Apple Warranty.  You'll get peace of mind, and fast service from Apple.Finally, iLife and iWork shine with MobileMe [...].  Get MobileMe.  Yes you can backup to an external HD or Apple's Time Capsule, but it's in the house with your computer.  For true backups you need to have it offsite.  MobileMe and the iDisk will give you this (20GB).  Also, you can backup to 64GB flash drives such as those by Kingston.  [More reliable than hard disk, consumes less power=more battery life, and light enough that you can easily carry a backup (not your only backup) with you.]iWork.com allows you to share and collaborate with your documents similar to Google docs.  Note, currently iWork.com is not quite up to par. Also, it is a separate subscription to MobileMe, though it is free for trial/demo.In sum: an excellent machine with excellent Hardware, Software and Service and with exciting possibilities for the near future.","Date":"February 7, 2009"}
{"Title":"17\" MacBook pro delivers on high expectations","Author":"Robbert Patrison","ReviewID":"R3ATWQEKBLZ06X","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using my new 17\" unibody MacBook Pro intensively for over a week. It has hold up to the high expectations that I had from it. The design is stunning: the solid aluminum body is offset by a pitch-black screen. When closed, its a sleek minimalist work-of-art that looks smaller than its massive 17\" screen size. The top lid and bottom aluminum body fit perfectly, sealed like a fridge by a magnet and a slim rubber edge that runs around the entire display. Its gorgeous from any angle: the back is flush has no battery bay and there are no visible ventilation holes. The fan exhausts are intricately hidden in the hinging mechanism of the display. The fans are barely audible under normal use.Putting the unibody in on your lap after a cold night is a boner-shrinking experience. Also when powered up the MBP runs cool, consuming only 18 watts in normal use. Battery life is about 5 hours if you only do some office work. That is probably as good as it gets today. Battery life is considerably less when the graphics is stressed, or when I boot it in Windows Vista instead of OSX. I noticed that the battery life predictor never gets even close to the promised 8 hours. Apple marketing is quite simply lying.The display is stunning: the sharpest and best contrast I've seen until now. The colors and sharpness of the glossy screen is visibly better that that of the matte screen (a $50 option). In contrast to the glossy screen, the matte display is not mounted flush into the case. Side-by-side, the glossy looks a lot better. I noticed no problem with the reflections of the glossy screen in heavy daily use.Performance is good. Subjectively it seems faster and more responsive than my daughter's Imac. The system wakes up within a few seconds after opening the lid. My previous Dell tool a full 2 minutes to fully wake up after sleep, and much longer after a cold start. That is a real productivity saver.Of the 5 laptops in my home (of different vintage and make), the MBP seems to have the best and most solid WIFI connectivity. It picks up base stations that are out-of-reach of the other machines or Iphones.There are some minor design flaws: the front edge of the laptop is quite sharp. This is where your wrists rest, especially  when using the trackpad.  By now I've gotten used to this S&M; experience with cold metal, but its clearly a case of form-over-function.Another flaw is that the beautiful design of the lid forces the connectors to the side instead of the back of the laptop. When placed on a desk (which is 95% of the time),  a wild assortment of wires sticks out on the left, taking up precious real-estate on my desk. Since external displays require a adapter, the mess is even larger. Apple does not provide a docking station so my daily routine involves plugging in and out 5 wires multiple times. Apple uses a nonstandard video plug that require one to schlepp around two extra adapter cables anywhere. I would have gladly sacrificed the entire DVD-drive for this, since that is only used to install software.I've installed Windows Vista in 2 flavors: running in parallel using VMWare fusion, and sequential using bootcamp. Vista is a sluggish, slow and clumsy operating system compared to MacOS, so the latter is my preferred mode of operation. Fusion is faster and more convenient, but its only flaw is that it does not support graphics well (Flight simulator X did not work).In short, the 17\" MBP is probably the best (and certainly the most beautiful) laptop one can buy at this time. Its considerably more expensive than similarly equipped competitors, but it makes up for that by better components and better design.","Date":"March 24, 2009"}
{"Title":"Dripping with Awesome Sauce","Author":"Brad Marx \"The Doctor\"","ReviewID":"R1U8SF6C30YC4J","Overall":"good","Content":"In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that my last laptop was an Acer Aspire 1640 (budget laptop) and that this is my first premium laptop. So, you can take my gushing with the appropriate amount of salt.That said, I really love the new Macbook Pro. It is a big plate of fantastic smothered in awesome sauce.-Multi Touch-While you won't be pinching and zooming all your apps or flicking windows around, multitouch scrolling, expose and right-click/CTRL-click all work really well. In fact, I held out from buying a Mac laptop because of the one button silliness. No buttons however, works like a dream. And the mutlitouch trackpad is pretty configurable to boot. I configured it to recognize a 2 finger tap as a right-click. It has spoiled me. I have a hard time using laptops w/o multitouch now.-Battery Life-They weren't kidding about the increased battery life. I get about 5 hours of design/coding/surfing time. I'm sure that watching videos and listening to music would impact that noticeably. But compare my 5 hour battery life to the 2 hour life of a friend's last gen Macbook Pro under the same usage. BTW, I have not changed the default performance settings or screen brightness for battery powered usage.-Display-The glossy screen may urk those used to a matte screen but I have always had glossy so it doesn't bug me. Aside from that, the screen looks great and seems on par with other glossy laptop screens--not noticeably better or worse really--and the color on it looks pretty good with no calibration. The black bevel adds a certain something to the experience and makes the screen feel bigger. There is a setting \"Automatically adjust brightness for ambient lighting\" which is on by default. While ingenious, for me, it fell into the too clever for their own good column as it made the display brightness change rapidly in any situation where the light was not consistent--such as a coffee shop where people frequently pass behind you blocking light. So I turned it off.-Mini Display Port-While it's great that the new display port allowed them to make the body slimmer or whatev, I have to say it stings a little knowing that I need a $30 dongle to hook it up to an external monitor while my buddy just plugs it in. It doesn't help the feeling knowing that previous generations of mac laptops (like the iBook) came with such dongles for free. Additionally, the DRM that is built into this port almost made this laptop a deal breaker. Not that I watch movies on external displays that are not compliant. I honestly don't even know if I own such a device. My problem is that DRM is such a ridiculous waste of resources and having it built into the hardware offends me to no end. To. No. End.-Other Thoughts-The performance is great even on battery power and even with a lot of apps open. The new body is very cool. It feels very sturdy, like all Macbooks, and looks really slick. I love the back-lit, black, chicklet keyboard that lights up based on the amount of ambient light. I also really dig that the new Macbook Pro is more environmentally friendly than the previous line and the packaging that it comes in is barely bigger than the laptop itself.This laptop is definitely the most awesome that I have ever used with only the aforementioned display issues holding me back from calling it absolutely perfect. Apple scores again.","Date":"February 12, 2009"}
{"Title":"Reviews from a Geek's perspective","Author":"Bhushir Mankad \"bhushir\"","ReviewID":"R3H7EOSWXH2PAK","Overall":"good","Content":"The experience of owning a mac, versus owning a PC are far different and the Mac wins hands down when it comes to providing the best 'customer experience'..For me, buying the Mac from Amazon was a risk since I live in Dubai and used temporary PO box in the US to get my Macbook Pro couriered to Dubai.. But it arrived all in one piece, and its working great...Speaking of the experience, right from the packaging (the white box as opposed to the conventional brown carton for a laptop), to the intro video of the mac OS X leopard, the Mag safe power cable with the magnetic latch, the ease of setting the OS up etc... it was all a breeze.. (my laptop arrived via courier at my office address, and i set up my system during lunch time.. less than 30 minutes flat)with regards to built quality, this thing is rock solid.. the aluminum unibody is robust, and you feel you're holding a block of metal.. no sqeaks, loose ends.... its pretty amusing to know how stalwarts like HP and Dell never thought of building a robust machine when it came to build quality.as for the performance, on paper the specs might not seem earth shattering, and there are a whole lot of other laptops that give a standard 3 GB ram and everything. But no one seems to be reading the fine lines. The frequencies of RAMs are higher, the caches are bigger, the chipsets are from nVidia (an intel chipset + nvidia graphic processor is a much slower option as compared to an nvidia chipset and nvidia graphic processor).in short, the hardware mix of the Macbook Pro (and the Macbook) is optimised to deliver performance with high amount of stability.. From the looks of it, all the hardware is tested to inter-operate seamlessly before the product is released into the market... before the mac I owned an HP, and the wireless device just used to konk off..! i have changed my motherboard thrice during my warranty period (HP service centres have been really helpful in this regard)as for software, OS X is certainly better, more intuitive, smooth and intelligent than Vista.. Vista is just plain paranoid, where it asks you every time you run a .exe file. Not to say that things dont hang in OS X.. things like Firefox do once in a while (rarely), but you can 'Force Quit' them and carry on with your other work.. unlike in Vista, where in all probablity you might have to restart the whole system..I use Adobe PS, InDesign, and Illustrator all together, along with iTunes running in the background, and Firefox downloading something or the other.. and all of them work like a charm.. and Expose+Spaces is like the icing on the cake.The whole 'all button' trackpad has met with a lot of criticism, but it really doesnt make a whole lot of difference.. i mean, if you're used to pressing buttons towards the bottom of the trackpad, do it by all means.. it will still work.. there's a right click too for those shifting from Windows..I run Win Xp SP2 on bootcamp.. and there's this only 1 MAJOR regret that have as far as MBP and MB goes.. I play a lot of games and they run beautifully on XP on mac using boot camp.. but for some weird reason the fans dont start spinning at higher speeds when running XP. and the GPUs clock temperatures upto 75-80 degrees C, which isnt really good..i use smc fan control for now, and tried using input remapper, but my Mac used to hang the moment i used Input remapper on XP. And this is the only reason why i gave it a 4 out of 5.. Else i'm a happy man..Hope this helps..Cheers.","Date":"February 2, 2009"}
{"Title":"MacBook Pro is a wonderful machine","Author":"The  Musician Physician","ReviewID":"R1LJNOWY0JWOL6","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a physician specializing in Radiology and an experienced computer user.  I spend most of my day working with images, voice recognition, and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS).  I was the physician on the committee that selected the enterprise wise PACS system we use at three hospitals in North Carolina. At work I use several work stations and at home with wife and children we actively use five windows computers.Recently, I was looking for a laptop so as not to have to share our Dell 600m with the family.  I was considering a loaded windows laptop from Dell or HP but I was attracted to the Mac family because of all I had heard about Mac and the included software.  I polled a dozen friends and acquaintances  and all but one suggested I try the Mac.  Boy were they right.  In one evening I created a website for my band Ad Nauseam [...] using the included iWeb software.  I have also used garage band to take my live recordings and split them into separate songs then dropping them into itunes and burning CDs for my friends.  Yes, I could do all this on my windows machines, but it is so easy on the MacBook Pro.  You pay a premium for the tight integration.  I am less frustrated and more productive with my  MacBook Pro.  I have not yet installed software that will allow me to run windows programs in parallel with my Mac programs.  This will be important if I want to have one machine for work and play.  I understand that others have been successful doing this.Adding the MacBook Pro to my home network and wireless N+ (Belkin) router was a snap.  I can watch streaming video and download videos via Miro with ease.  Safari and Firefox are fine internet browsers.  Last weekend the children and I had an \"iChat\" with my sister and her family in CT for almost an hour.  The kids love seeing each other on the web cam and once again it was so easy to perform with the included, integrated software.I chose the 15\" version because I thought the 17\" might be to large on my lap.  With young kids around, I felt I might be more apt to have an accident with the larger one.  I did opt for the faster CPU though not sure how significant the difference between the two processors is in practice.Apple Care has been very helpful in answering my questions in a friendly and understandable way.  I bought the 3year apple care protection plan elsewhere for about [...].In short, I highly recommend the MacBook Pro for anyone interested in using a laptop for anything more than email and internet browsing.  I will  give the machine 5 stars when I get around to putting my work software on it.  My wife and I were surfing on our laptops together last night. I'm just waiting for her to ask for her own.","Date":"January 21, 2009"}
{"Title":"Simultaneously gorgeous and utilitarian","Author":"Paul Cantrell","ReviewID":"R1CGNMKK86410N","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple's update to their laptop case design is really magnificent. The new machines have a much more rigid, substantial feel, and appear to be much less susceptible to the torquing and bending that could afflict the older ones. And it's exactly as beautiful as the photos make it look.The performance is excellent, and jaw-dropping for somebody who came from a nearly 4-year-old Powerbook. I got this souped up 2.53 GHz configuration because of some of the work I do on the machine: developing very RAM-intensive imagery software, and audio recording and editing. If you're not doing something like that, and if you're not a hard-core gamer -- if you're using the machine for word processing and email and maybe iPhoto -- just get the 2.4 GHz. You won't notice the difference. Even if you do need the RAM or the hard drive, but you're not a gamer, you may not care about the improved graphics card. Consider ordering the 2.4 from Apple and upgrading the RAM and HD on that configuration. It will come out about $250 cheaper. I was going to do that, and bought the 2.53 instead only because it was on sale! (Still haven't received my rebate, although it hasn't quite been long enough that I'm concerned. But I have my eye on you, Amazon.)I was worried about the glossy screen, but find that I love it. Yes, it is *very* glossy -- but it's also vivid, extremely sharp, quite amazingly bright, and takes no time to reach its full brightness. The brightness easily overwhelms any more moderate reflections. I find that reflections rarely bother me. Surprisingly, it's usable in direct sunlight -- more so than previous Apple notebooks, in fact. The one situation where it's real trouble is when the sun is directly behind me or shining on me: then the reflection is bothersome. If your work setup is like that, be warned!The new keyboard feels great. It has a more solid, less squishy feel than the previous MacBook Pro. I find the touch pleasantly reminiscent of the original Titanium Powerbook, which always felt great to my fingers. My only complaint is that I can no longer press cmd and option simultaneously with one thumb; I am having to get used to new fingerings.The trackpad's increased area is fabulous, and the feel is great. The click, however, is distractingly loud. At first, having the whole thing be the button was a bit disconcerting, but I quickly got used to it and now like it better than the original. The two-finger right click is genius. Note that you can touch the trackpad with two fingers and then click with your thumb to get a right click! Much easier than their demo. The three-finger gestures are more or less useless; the four-finger expose gestures are more practical.The laptop is very slightly wider than the older model, which meant that I had to get a new case. I recommend Tom Bihn's \"Brain Cell,\" which protects against both dropping and bending, and fits inside your backpack (the vertical version) or briefcase (the horizontal).If you have any Firewire 400 devices, note that you do NOT need to buy an adapter! There are cables that go directly from FW 400 at one end to FW 800 at the other, and they eat up a lot less space.My only major complaint is really about the price of cables. The Mini DisplayPort is wonderfully small, and I see why they ditched DVI for it. The adapter cables, however, are ridiculously expensive! Furthermore, you can't just get a Displayport-to-DVI adapter and then plug your existing DVI-to-VGA into it. Doesn't work. Instead, you have to get a separate Displayport-to-VGA cable. Blah. Somebody needs to start making some generic adapter cables so that Apple can't get away with charging $30 for them!Despite my minor complaints, this is a magnificent machine -- and miles ahead of any other laptop in terms of both beauty and functional design.","Date":"December 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"Amazing machine","Author":"Smart Little Magpie","ReviewID":"R11A3T2ESFND8U","Overall":"good","Content":"I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","Date":"December 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"C. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows","Author":"Eagle Vision","ReviewID":"R3L7OKJPVR55VJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!","Date":"December 30, 2008"}

Espenschied \"ScoDal\"","ReviewID":"R2VGRT0I45JFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.","Date":"December 14, 2012"}

This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.  Colors are vibrant and black levels are the deepest I've seen in a portable.Highly recommended.","Date":"April 10, 2009"}

{"Title":"Beautiful Laptop","Author":"S. Webb","ReviewID":"R17OT3NYH42LLI","Overall":"good","Content":"I upgraded my PowerBook 17 to the new MacBook Pro 15. It's a beautiful machine. Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

{"Title":"My 1st Mac...Love it!","Author":"J. Buck","ReviewID":"R296B1VMD0A6G2","Overall":"good","Content":"After looking and researching for a long time I decided to switch to mac. This review is for the Macbook Pro 2.4 GHz and 2GB RAM. This is my first mac and I have had very little experience with mac before this purchase. I have had this computer for a few weeks now so I feel like I can provide an accurate review.Design: Absolutely beautiful! It seems like they really thought everything out. The magnetic latch and magnetic power cord are genius and very nice features. The computer does seem very sturdy and well built.Screen: I know many complaints are about the screen and it is indeed reflective. HOWEVER, I have yet to have a problem with reflection and the screen is vibrant, I love it.Hinge: I have read complaints on the hinge being too weak. I have not experienced this with mine and would say the resistance is about perfect. I can tip the computer at a very steep angle without the screen falling.Trackpad: This was one feature I was a little concerned about. I did experience a few problems with the trackpad but the update from apple fixed that. I can honestly say this is probably one of the greatest features of the machine. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the gestures and not having a dedicated button. Now, I feel like all other machines should have this trackpad and I really miss it when I am using other machines.Keyboard: This is a personal preference but I love the \"Chicklet\" style keys and it feels great. The backlight is nice to have also.Performance: This machine is fast! I have the Adobe CS4 Design premium loaded on the machine and it handles it with no problem. All other programs open and run amazingly fast. I have yet to have any problems with performance. Also, the machine is very quiet and stays cool. Battery life seems to be fine but I have not really put it to the test.Compatibility: I have yet to experience any compatibility issues. I do have Windows XP running through VMware Fusion 2.0 and it works pretty good (Separate review for this product). All my electronics and printers just worked...sure is nice.Value: So far I am very happy with my purchase. The machine runs great, looks great, and I am happy that I made the switch. I do not miss my PC at all. You will pay a premium for a Mac but it is a premium product. If you want a excellent computer and are thinking about this machine, I would highly recommend purchasing one.I was debating between the Macbook and the Macbook Pro and I am glad I went with the Pro. The extra screen size is very nice to have and the machine is not all that big.","Date":"December 22, 2008"}

{"Title":"15 year PC con-vert to Mac. THIS model MacBook made me do it.","Author":"Kevin Quattro","ReviewID":"RYB98AZ7KNOB6","Overall":"good","Content":"What can I say? Maybe it's my age catching up with me. I am not sure. I know that I was just tired of all the mess there is in keeping a PC up to date and always running. Drivers, inter-application support, all of this is just something PC owners deal with and have gotten use to. I'm tired of it.I found the iLife suite of applications a perfect answer for everything I needed. iPhoto, iMovie and of course iTunes (which I was already using on the PC along with my iPhone) are just a joy to use. iPhotos \"places, faces and events\" are super cool. And it's amazing how easy it is to get photos in and tagged. Everything about OSX just flows easily and never gets in my way. Everything works together smoothly and nothing competes with each other. i.e. WIndows Photo Viewer and Media Player both wanting to manange your pictures and videos DIFFERENTLY. Typical PC reply is \"oh just download this other app and install this service and then run this codec pack and set this registry entry and you're all set'\"  NO...I'M DONE WITH THAT. iLife and OSX WORK.Now to the hardware.I liked the previous generation MacBook Pro. It was missing some things though for the price. For one, it seemed to not really offer much in build and features I couldn't get elsewhere much cheaper in a PC laptop. This was not to say I would buy a PC but it meant I was looking at the MacMini or possibly even the iMac. Something I didn't really want to do. I wanted a laptop. So I waited. Another year with the PC...then finally these new ones hit.I was blown away by the features videos and when I got to handle one in person...WOW. They are thinner yet completely SOLID. Picking one up or just smashing the keys and you feel like you're using something God would use. I can rest my fat palms on the faceplate without worry. The new black backlit keys are MUCH easier to see and feel great! The buttonless touch pad (the entire thing is a button) is amazing. It's like the iPhone except with the addition of a button. Which is perfect. Be nice if the iPhone could get this feature some how. The gesture support is spot on. It's the first time I've ever used a touchpad and NOT wanted to get a mouse instantly. You can really use it all day and it's transparent. It operates so smoothly. FINALLY.The sound from the speakers is much improved. iTunes in the background or jamming out loud is very clear and full sounding for a laptop speaker. Nothing sounds harsh or crushed. They are laptop speakers mind you, but for that, they are the best I've heard.The display is very clear and off angle is nice. I find the contrast to be pretty good and the 3D performance to be awesome. (and should be with a 9600). The auto switching to the slower power saving 9400 is a pretty neat trick too. I play World of Warcraft and EVE-Online and they both run quite smoothly. When running on battery there is a performance hit with the cycled down cpu and slower 9400, but you'd expect that. I also tried Team Fortress 2 via \"Crossover for Games\" and it ran very smoothly. With only a couple of small display glitches.My only real complaint is the lack of USB ports, it has two. I really wish it had TWO more. My model has the express slot instead of the mini card slot. I find you have many more expansion options with the express slot. Including putting in your own mini card reader. So why limit your options?Finally, Amazon's price was $200 cheaper than Apple's. I got no tax and free 2 day shipping on top of that, pretty sweet.","Date":"September 29, 2009"}

{"Title":"The Best Computer I Ever Owned","Author":"Chris Damon \"Classic TV & Tech Guy\"","ReviewID":"R29T0CUELIHAE0","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this computer for about 6 months now, and I love my MacBook Pro. At home I have a Logitech wireless external keyboard and mouse, a Western Digital Firewire 800 external drive, and a 22\" HP Flat Widescreen Monitor, so it is almost like having a desktop only cooler. I am a dual OS user (Windows/Mac) and I also have both OS on my Mac. Mac OS is by far the superior operating system. But, this computer runs Windows XP and Windows 7 (beta) fast. That's the good thing about a Mac, you can natively run Windows without emulation software, so there is nothing sucking up the processor power! Of course you can use VM Ware or Parallels if you want to run WIndows while running Mac OS which is also cool, but just not as fast. So, for all the people who cry about how expensive the Mac is, IT IS TWO COMPUTERS IN ONE, a Windows machine, a Mac, and  if you want to run Linux that too. Everything runs flawlessly in windows as long as it is either USB or firewire. I also upgraded my wireless router to an \"N\" device, and let me tell you, the router is in my basement and I am two flights up. I get a faster connection than with my ethernet cable plugged in (running 100 Mbps). My next upgrade will be an Time Capsule, though part of my external drive is partitioned for Time Machine, which works quietly on its own in the background.When I go out with my MacBook Pro I never had any problem connecting to Public WiFi networks. The computer simply finds what's available and asks you if you want to connect, it's easier than Windows wireless connections. I also must admit, that when going places, this is the machine you want to be seen with, it is just attractive. So far I haven't seen anyone else with this machine at the places I bring it, I see mostly older MacBook Pros, but the \"Black\" keys give away that you have the newer model, not to mention the slim aluminum case. The keys are lit from behind for dark locations, shut off in bright locations to save battery, and dim accordingly as the light changes. There is also manual control, but the automatic works fine. Same with the screen brightness. It adjusts automatically according to the lighting of the environment you are currently in. There is also manual adjustment, but I never touch it. It also dims during periods of inactivity to save battery power. The screen itself is just awesome, the best laptop screen out there. I am a fan of glossy screens, to me it just makes the picture more vibrant, so those who like the matte screen might be disappointed, since this model does not that.The NVidia Graphics in this machine is top notch too, I use this laptop for video, and with the high graphics turned on, this laptop does a great job. A quick note though, if you are on battery power you will definitely want to just use the integrated graphics mode, since this will almost double the runtime. You will also want to turn off the bluetooth radio, since this also eats up a lot of juice. It's best to bring the power adapter if you plan on doing video or picture editing or heavy bluetoothing.When I go out, I use the trackpad, and leave the mouse at home. You get use to the pad quickly, including the gestures and lack of any buttons, it is quite intuitive. You just have to remember that the button is towards the bottom.The only thing that is a \"con\" for me is that the DVD writer is only 8X and not 16X, but that is just a minor inconvenience.","Date":"June 2, 2009"}

The MacBook Pro is all brighter, sharper, and more beautiful. The screen opens with just a slight touch and the picture is all there in all colors. The screen is like an endless pool - no sharp edges, filled with light and color.The display was very important to me and that is why I chose this over the other models. Side by side, the pictures are like night and day. There is no comparison.One of the most interesting changes is how intuitive and insightful the new trackpad is. This trackpad allows a variety of new moves, including using two fingers or more at a time - even for scrolling.Light up keyboard. Never even knew I needed it though it probably won't be convenient outside.This computer is bigger and faster, as fast as a computer could be. I always wonder why a computer would need to go any faster but the next one always does. Do we get faster? Or does the endless quest for more speed just make us think we do?Concerns:There is a fragility to this that I don't remember ever noticing with my PowerBook. My PowerBook has traveled in backpacks and briefcases and may even have been thrown in a purse from time to time. (Much worse has happened to it.) I even fell off an icy ledge once, with it in my backpack, and it survived. Cats have slept on the PowerBook, open and closed. Drinks have been spilled. The Powerbook is like a workhorse whereas the MacBook Pro seems a little too delicate to throw in a backpack.This is my third Macintosh and the best so far. I was reluctant to leave behind my PowerBookG4 as it moves onto the boat for a second life as a navigator. Luckily I'll still have weekend privileges.","Date":"May 28, 2009"}

Speed!","Author":"JuanGuapo","ReviewID":"RGCP8BEV1I21R","Overall":"good","Content":"** UPDATE - 5/20/09 **Having owned this Mac notebook for a little over two weeks now, I can safely say it maintains the 5/5 stars I have given it.  I recently installed Windows XP Professional under Bootcamp and it went really smoothly; I still need Windows for some proprietary software I use, and for some mild gaming.  For instance, I picked up Oblivion - GOTY Edition for $20 and thought I'd give it a good run on the Macbook Pro.I haven't had a chance to run any heavy-hitter games yet, but Oblivion runs beautifully at the full 1440x900 w/ 4x AA and Very High Quality settings.  I'm averaging anywhere from 25fps-60fps, depending on the number of sprites; forests (35-40fps), oblivion (40-42fps), town squares (50fps), water and swimming (30-40fps).  The lowest I've seen is 25fps but haven't been able to replicate it; I'm thinking it was Windows running a background process I missed or forget to turn off.  In any case, it runs beautifully.I've really come to appreciate the extra screen real estate, and the display quality of the MBP.  We own a mid-2008 20\" iMac 2.66Ghz and the screen is every bit as good of quality; I really feel like the Macbook Pro is like a \"portable iMac\" in terms of speed and display quality.  It's that good!Lastly, I had a chance to pick up Apple's DisplayPort -> VGA adapter since I will need to hook this notebook up to a LCD projector more than a few times next semester.  The dongle is not cheap but does what it says it will without any fuss.  To test it, I hooked it up to my 42\" 1080i HDTV and it looked beautiful, no interference or pixelation.Two weeks later, this little guy is still working every bit as good as the day I bought it.  :-)--For the past few weeks, I've been shopping for a new notebook computer.  I've owned/used Mac in the past, but am comfortable in both worlds; I prefer Mac, but can get along fine in Windows too.I inevitably ended up with the 15\" Macbook Pro 2.66Ghz because of the sheer size, weight, and performance.  After I spent some time actually touching/using all the competing brands, I came to the following conclusion--you truly do get what you pay for.Some would argue that Macs are too expensive and not worth the hefty cost over their Windows/PC counterparts. Moreover, they would also say that you're paying extra for the fancy-shmancy design and chimp-simple ease of use, not to mention feeding into the smugness of the Mac community.However, my wife and I have owned Macs for the last few years, and I've had a really good experience owning Apple computers.One thing I noticed immediately is the build quality; it's amazing, and very well made.  When you pick up the computer, it feels very rigid and sturdy; it really does feel like a solid piece of equipment compared to other notebooks.The fans are very quiet and the unit seems to regulate heat/temperature very well.  When I turn it on, the Macbook 'bonggggg' sound is the only thing I hear, and cannot hear the hard drive at all.  It's probably the quietest computer I've ever owned.I've not owned this unit long enough (less than 36hrs) to give a more detailed example, but I'm very delighted with the performance in iMovie and iPhoto '09.  It's VERY fast.All in all, whether you choose the 2.4Ghz or 2.6Ghz, it's a great investment in a notebook computer.  Again, you really do get what you pay for.","Date":"February 16, 2009"}

Incredible graphics, ungodly amounts of storage, and works with great speed. You can drop this thing, put things on it, leave it running 948290 applications and spill stuff all over it and it STILL preforms like it's brand new. All hail Steve Jobs and the Apple company. This thing is miraculous.as far as the company that sold this too me goes?Do not purchase from Proton Computers.I bought this through them and they never \"informed\" me that this was not refurbished. When I bought it with the understanding that it was. I expected to get a brand new shiny looking computer, and it had physical defects all over it. As well as a very used up battery.Regardless, the upgrades they did to this thing we're enough for me not too care too much. They also credited me money to get things like the clutch cover fixed.","Date":"April 5, 2012"}
{"Title":"Great so far","Author":"Daniel Cook \"Elwood\"","ReviewID":"R2FZIEVNW7JEZA","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the macbook pro for a few hours now and so far I am quite impressed. This is my first ever laptop, which I figured I would need after college. My last computer was a 20 inch intel iMac that was pretty darn fast - but certainly not as fast as this laptop is.I am most impressed with the speed of spotlight and programs in general.The only con - and I can tell it is something that will upset me over time - is the sharp corners (those formed where the keyboard surface and side meet), and by sharp I merely mean annoying on the wrists when typing. Luckily I will be using a 24 inch screen and seperate keyboard and mouse most of the time so this shouldn't be too bad.","Date":"July 4, 2009"}

{"Title":"No Problems Here","Author":"Callie \"damn the critics!\"","ReviewID":"R21FKVW0DCM3ZT","Overall":"good","Content":"I used this computer for work for almost 3 years - and another person at the office used it before me for a while.  Absolutely no issues, computer worked great.  I ran some image-intensive programs on it for a while (Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop 32bit), and it handled them fine.  My main issue long term is I ran out of disk space as there is only about 150GB of disk space.  Gets used up when you start filling up your computer with a ton of large image files.  If you aren't doing stuff like that you'll be fine.  Or you could just buy an external hard drive to store your large files on.Anyway, I don't get all of the negative reviews.  Was not my experience at all.  Both of the computer batteries still work great.  It's not a top of the line laptop anymore, but it gets the job done and appears to be a long-lasting piece of equipment.Edit: January 2013-I gave this to my brother so he could have good personal computer and it's working great for him. He mainly uses it for internet, movies, etc., nothing too crazy.","Date":"May 11, 2012"}

I too was disappointed with the very dim display when running on battery until I figured out that Dell has set it that way in the system BIOS to persumably extend the battery charge. If you hit the F2 key while the laptop boots up you can enter the Setup and correct this. I moved it from a default setting of 3 to 6 and the display dims only slightly now on battery.Be careful not to change other settings while in setup unless you know what you're doing. You could cause major problems.","Date":"December 1, 2008"}
{"Title":"Dell XPS M1330 after owning XPS M1210","Author":"BigMutt","ReviewID":"R3JAQC0STEO3V3","Overall":"good","Content":"I loved my M1210 and used it for 18 months but recently got an M1330 and I like it even better, except for a few things.I did like the 12-inch size and weight of the former, but the 1330 is brighter and the keyboard is a little larger, making for improved useability.BTW, the specs are almost equal: 2.2 GHz processor and 2 Gb. RAM;  with NVidia video card.So the speed is pretty much equal also.I put 4 Gb RAM into both, and the performance difference is negligible.  Don't waste your money:  2 Gb is plenty.The 9-cell battery of the 1330 is bulky and ugly, compared to the 9-cell of the M1210.by the way, about batteries:  that 9-cell from my M1210 is just about shot, even though the laptop was hardly ever run from only this battery.  When using the 1210 mobile, I used the 6-cell almost exclusively;  only using the 9-cell when the laptop was running on AC power.  Why would that wear out a battery?The 6-cell from the M1210 is still fine, having been used about 5 hours a week for 18 months.I liked the rotating camera of the 1210; the 1330 camera is fixed.The 1330 has better heat dissipation: there's a copper tubing setup that winds its way around heat-producing sources and wicks it over to the fan area;  new in this latest design.I hate the multi-media touch controls of the 1330 as compared to regular buttons (cooly lit-up blue) that you push & click to use, on the 1210.I don't like the fact that screen on the 1330 doesn't tilt back further than about 120 degrees,  as opposed to the 1210 tilting back all the way, flat to 180 degrees.the 1330 has HDMI port which the 1210 didn't,  but it only has 2 USB ports compared to the 1210's four.The HDD of the 1330 is more difficult to get at and swap out than the HDD of the 1210.The 1330 could have been made even a bit smaller, because there's a wide wasted-space frame bordering the screen,  but that would have meant making the keyboard the same size as the 1210.  Fine with me, but maybe users with big fat hands complained about not enough keyboard room.Overall a nice laptop.  I especially appreciate the MedeaDirect setup that both of these laptops have: a very nice & useful touch.This is my sixth Dell laptop and because of their excellent warranty service and great customer care support (especially XPS support)  I can't see myself buying anything else.","Date":"April 10, 2008"}

You'd think that the computer would last a heck of a lot longer than 8 months but i guess not.  I will continue to use this laptop and save up for a new one.

It is the perfect first computer for her age group.  The parental controls on a Mac are exactly what a parent would want.  My daughter can not go on any website unless I have created a shortcut button for it in her favorites bar.  I was able to decide what applications she is allowed to use and I set up network sharing between my computer and hers.It doesn't have the latest and greatest of everything on it but for my 10 year old it has everything she could ever want.  She will probably use this as her primary computer for the next 5 years and at less than $200, that makes it an awesome investment.Plus, with it being a Mac, it will continue to last as an extra laptop for my family forever!  I still have a G3 desktop Mac that I have been using for photography work since 1998 and I have never had a problem with it.  I trust Apple computers with my life and I would never buy any other computer brand.","Date":"February 5, 2011"}

I had recently purchased a more recent model Inspiron and had had no issues installing Ubuntu so I was hoping for no hiccups here.

I bought mine from Office Max for around$720 with tax in 2005. The only problem I've had out of it is when I.....put a pen on the keyboard near thescreen and foolishly closed it without thinking; cracking the screen. I've taken it apart and depending onprice, I might replace it.

I use it as a dvr too. The battery is my only real issue it only holds charge for about an hour or so now so I think I will buy a new battery soon. these laptops do overheat if you dont use a cooling fan underneath them the bottom of the machine just dosent have enough space to circulate any air under its huge baseplate so prolonged use is limited to about an hour if you dont provide a usb cooling device underneath it. once you address that issue it will run true and cool without a hitch. I can only guess that a lot of people have let their laptops fry themselves out rather than spend the 20 dollars on a cooling pad.

{"Title":"Totally Love it!","Author":"Tell the Truth","ReviewID":"RN9W367FPDG1E","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this laptop a few years ago and it was absoulutely awesome!  It was listed with Dell as a gaming computer and it was good for games as well as all of the work related things I needed to do.  Just under 5 pounds it was pretty easy to tote around when i was on work related trips.  This model is the last XPS that Dell made with a 12.1 screen.  The dementions of this laptop is a nice \"in-between\" size: it is a bit bigger than a netbook but also a bit smaller than a laptop with a 13\" screen.This baby has 4 USB ports and that is a bit difficult to find these days. You never think you are going to need all those USB ports until it happens!  The hard drive is upgradable to a 500GB if you want to go that high (I upgraded mine to a 320GB and it worked fine. Everyone that saw it loved it! I even had offers to purchase it but I always  refused!Also, not only is it nearly impossible to find a laptop with this size screen, number of USB ports but to have all of this AND it's Core 2 Duo AND it has a  CD/DVD+RW drive is a dream come true. The only problem that I had was that the regular battery only lasted two years so I had to buy another one.  If that is the only issue with a laptop, I think it's worth it.So if you want something small, but not to small and you want it to have the capacity to handle all the bells and whistles you may later want to add, this is a perfect choice!","Date":"March 19, 2011"}

{"Title":"WOW Best laptop your money can buy.","Author":"Jaewoo Kim \"OB-Wan\"","ReviewID":"R3PK9WSX3ITRS3","Overall":"good","Content":"I own the latest 2.8Ghz MacBook Pro with 512MB of VRAM, 4gb 1024mhz RAM, new polymer battery,  and optional 7200 RPM 500GB drive.  I am using both Mac OS and Vista Premium using Bootcamp. I have used my MacBook Pro for a month.Compared to my previous laptop (Dell XPS 1530: 2.0 Ghz, 2GB RAM, 256MB 8600GT VRAM), which was a very good laptop, the MacBook Pro is  stunningly awesome.  The MacBook Pro is far smaller and portable yet performs at MUCH higher level than my Dell ever did.LOOKSIf the MacBook Pro was a woman, it would be Miss Universe. It is thin, light, and as portable as 15.4 inch laptop can be.  Its aluminum casing is not only pleasing to the eye, but also pleasing to the touch as well. There is no cheap plastic anywhere to be found.PERFORMANCEVista Performance Index rates my MacBook Pro at 5.5 (5 is considered very good). The only reason why it is not higher is because the Nvidia 512MB 9600 is not awesome (but still very good) in 3D graphics performance. It is worth noting the 9600 laptop graphics card still performs better in 3D graphics than majority of desktop graphics cards of today.From a usability perspective, this laptop is blazing fast. There is no noticeable lag between CPU and Memory as I have seen with my Dell XPS 1530 laptop (Dell is undermining the performance of its laptops by using cheaper and subpar memory chips). The BUS on this system is also top notch as well.When I play BioShock on Vista, the graphics looks very crisp and the overall responsiveness is very good.Bottom line: you will not be disappointed with the performance of this laptop unless you are comparing it to that of a high end desktop. Certainly, you will be hard pressed to find any medium size 15.4 inch laptop that can even duplicate MacBook Pro's overall performance.TOUCHPAD and SOUNDThe new touchpad is the mouse reinvented. The new touchpad is so good, this is the ONLY laptop which I do not carry a separate portable mouse.  The new touchpad is large, responsive, and just has that WOW factor to it. THE NEW TOUCHPAD, BY ITSELF, IS A GOOD REASON TO GET A MACBOOK.On Vista, the touchpad works almost as well as it does on Mac OS. The only feature missing in Vista is the ability to twist pictures and other objects (not all apps in Mac OS support this feature either).The sound quality is good, but not terrific. On Vista, the MacBook produces maybe 60% of maximum volume it can produce on Mac OS. I have tried reinstalling drivers on Vista but to no avail. I wish MS or Apple will fix this problem (I am sure this is a driver, and not a hardware, issue).PORTABILITY, BATTERY, and HEATBecause of its small form factor and solid all aluminum body, the MacBook Pro is eminently portable. I have had many of laptops (about 8) both for work and for personal use, and this laptop is BY FAR the most portable of all.The battery lasts around 7 hours when I run the Mac OS (9600 graphics card turned off). The battery lasts 4 hours when I run the Vista Home Premium edition (9600 graphics card turn on because it can't be turned off in Vista). My main concern, however, with running Vista on this laptop is not with the battery life but with excess heat output.This laptop is flat and the hottest portion of this laptop is concentrated in the rear bottom. When placed on a flat surface, much of the heat is trapped underneath. The MacBook Pro can overheat to a point where it is uncomfortable to touch the upper surface near the keyboard.  The heat isn't much of a problem with Mac OS, but with Vista, the user must be careful. I strongly advice using MacBook on a open bottom surface, such as laptop stand with an open bottom surface area for ventilation, when using Vista.  You laptop will last longer.Mac OS vs VISTAI was pleasantly surprised that Mac OS can now run Flash and Adobe Acrobat Reader. The compatibility between Mac and PC is closer than ever. MS Entourage (part of Mac Office 2008) is compatible with MS Exchange email, calendar, and contacts. Overall, I am impressed with the Mac OS Leopard. But its achilles heel is still software availability. Although Apple has greatly expanded its library of available Mac compatible software, most softwares, particularly video games,  still do not run on Mac. For Vista, and its successor Windows 7, to better compete against the Mac OS in the laptop market space, it needs to greatly enhance its battery life and substantially lower its heat output.FLAWSI have only two gripes1)Vista cannot utilize the full range of sound the MacBook hardware is capable. Notably, the maximum volume is too low. This can be easily fixed by Apple by updating the sound driver in BootCamp (HINT).2)The Caps Lock button is extremely easy to press. So easy, I wish I could find a way to disable the key.","Date":"July 26, 2009"}
{"Title":"A great, but expensive machine.","Author":"Jon R","ReviewID":"R3LDSGWN561WBV","Overall":"good","Content":"When looking over reviews for Macs, you tend to run into the Apple fanatics. These people will praise anything that Apple makes, regardless of whether its worth the price or not. Having owned and used both PCs and Macs, I have no allegiance to either. I'm going to try to make this as unbiased as possible.Whether you should go with a Mac or PC largely depends on what you'll use it for. These days Mac ARE PCs under the hood, they just use Apple's BIOS (EFI) and of course OS X. OS X is hands down a superior OS to Windows, however there are many applications that won't work under it. Sure you can boot Windows on Mac now, but why would you pay the premium to use Apple's proprietary hardware if your going to use Windows anyway? If your going to get a Mac make sure most of your applications will run on it. Otherwise the Macbook becomes an overpriced PC.That said this is a review of the Mackbook Pro, so here are the pros and cons of it. Its a bit long, but I tried to point out everything.PROS- Beautiful, bright screen- Backlit keyboard- Glass cover LCD, so you can wash it without worring about damaging the LCD.- Fast DDR3 memory- An integrated graohics card to conserve power (GeForce 9400) and a decent graphics card (Nvidia 9600 GT) to use for gaming and graphic intense programs.- Slot-load DVD drive, you don't have to worry about the tray.- Firewire, a feature missing from the regular Macbook- Nice large and responsive touchpad.- OS X performs much better than Windows. Almost no crashes/freezes, very hard to get a virus, and faster.- No preloaded bloatware, in fact most of the apps included are quite useful and easily removed if you want the space back.- Decent speakers for a laptop.- I have no benchmarks, but it seems like Vista runs faster on my Macbook even though the hardware is inferior to my other laptop.- The thinnest and lightest 15 inch notebook I've ever encountered. I have no problem lugging it back and forth.CONS- It get HOT under intense use (especially above the number pad).- The DVD drive is slow to burn and read.- Screen resolution should be higher for this price.- Multi-Touch touchpad takes some getting used to.- THE PRICE.- Despite the fact that Nvidia claims its possible to use the 9400 and 9600 in \"hybred SLI\" (using the 9400 to give the 9600 a power boost) Apple has not included the functionality. There are report that it may come with the next release of OS X.- The HDD is realitivly slow at only 5400 RPM. They should have gone with a 7200RPM. On the bright side its possible to upgrade the drive yourself.- The only video output port is a \"Mini Display Port\". There are currently only two screens on the market that natively support this. Therefor you need to purchase a converter to use HDMI, DVI, or VGA.- The glass screen is VERY reflective.- For the most part its not upgradeable. You can add memory or a new HDD and that's it. However, most laptops are either not upgradable or the \"upgrades\" are so expensive that its better to buy a new one instead.- A minor qualm for me, and something common to nearly all Macs is the lack of an HDD access light. This can sometimes be useful. Also common to al Macs is the keyboard and shortcuts. These are different from Windows and take getting use to. For the most part neither is better than the other, its just a matter of learning a new setup.Overall I love my Macbook. Despite its higher price you get a quality machine for your money. Its much more solid than my other laptop, and s far seems more stable. I would say that if you don't game (or use one of the few games that support OS X) go for this. If you've never thought about a Mac before, its really not that hard to get to know it. Its designed for the computer illiterate (According to Apple, I wouldn't go quite that far), so you shouldn't have trouble finding your way around. Despite the good, I still would recommend you stick with the PC if you intend on gaming. Macs are getting there, but they just don't stand up to a gaming PC.","Date":"April 26, 2009"}

{"Title":"Apple's New MacBook Pro: Reviewed","Author":"alxclrsn","ReviewID":"R2QSWN25L359SM","Overall":"good","Content":"Introduction:After keeping millions in what seemed to be perpetual suspense, Apple finally broke the ice, and, in October, released completely redesigned MacBooks and MacBook Pros. I like many Apple users, ordered my MacBook Pro within a week of its release, (October 20th) and, with great anticipation, opened the box on the 30th. Unfortunately for me, upon inspecting the MacBook Pro that I had ordered, I discovered a fair sized chip in the aluminum casing behind the screen, on the bottom right corner. I immediately called Apple to see what they were going to do to rectify the situation. After waiting on hold for about ten minutes, my call was answered by a very nice man, who apologized profusely for any inconvenience. Unfortunately, there was not much he could do, so I was transfered to a product specialist. By this point, you are undoubtedly bored by this story, so let it suffice to say, that after another two weeks I was finally presented with a working MacBook Pro, as well as two red iPod Shuffles as an apology.Apology accepted, Apple. Now, onto my `test' configuration. This exceptional `Book came with a 2.8 gigahertz processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM, two graphics cards: an NVIDIA 9600M with 256 megabytes of shared video RAM, and an NVIDIA 9600GT, with 512 megabytes of dedicated DDR3 video RAM. To top this baby off, it also has a 128 gigabyte solid state drive, to access data at light-speed, with added security. In addition, like every other new MacBook Pro, this one also came with a 15.4 inch widescreen display, backlit keyboard similar to that on the MacBook Air, an iSight camera and microphone, an all aluminum unibody enclosure, and a buttonless, multi-touch trackpad. So, without further ado, lets begin.Screen:I love this screen. First off, it is lit by LED's, which means it is brighter and more efficient than its earlier iterations. It also has `instant on' capabilities, meaning that lights up as soon as you open the lid. Now, nearly everybody's number one gripe with this machine is the glass that is covering the display. While it increases the richness and vibrancy of the colors, and increases the screen's durability, it is also reflective. The reflection can, in direct sunlight, cause an admittedly distractive reflection. This does not especially bother me, though, because you can simply rotate the laptop a few degrees to the left or right to completely counteract this problem. This makes glass an ideal material for a laptop screen, in my opinion, because if the glare gets bad, you can always just rotate the machine. Now the new LED Cinema Display is another story...Unibody:At the release of this product, Apple was keen to stress the design of this product, including its new `unibody' enclosure. So, what's this all about? Well, in a normal laptop, many interior parts must be added to keep the the computer from twisting or torquing. What Apple has done is replace those parts with a single machined piece of aluminum, thus cutting down on weight and increasing durability. Basically, the metal top case that has holes for the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, and power button is the `unibody.' Honestly, the laptop does feel sturdier, but the weight remains the same, at least for the Pro. I really don't think anybody but an engineer is going to seriously consider this a serious feature, though.Keyboard:As I stated in an earlier review of the MacBook Air, this is, hands down, Apple's best keyboard. I like everything about it. I can, though, notice a slight difference in the feeling of this keyboard when compared with the MacBook Air. The keys feel a bit springier... and I like it. The backlighting is very nice, too, and I noticed that it gets brighter than the Air. One should know that the baseline MacBook does not have backlighting, while the higher end MacBook has `dumb' backlighting which lights the keyboard for five seconds after every key strike, rather than relying on an ambient light sensor. Otherwise, the keyboard is the same.TrackpadThe MacBook Pro is sporting an all new trackpad, which is made entirely of glass. Honestly, you can't tell that its glass. It feels exactly the same. Well, except for the lack of buttons, that is. Yeah, it appears that Steve hates buttons so much that he is attempting to remove them from Apple products... one button at a time. I'm pretty sure that `Jony' Ive is in on that too. It's the great Apple conspiracy! In all seriousness, though, the lack of buttons is a little annoying at first, but you soon get used to it. As a replacement, our fruity friends made the entire trackpad click, which is actually a pretty good alternative. As I said earlier, it takes a while, but you get used to it. Also, they made the bottom corners extra clicky to make it feel more like the old trackpad, while making it progressively harder to click the farther up the trackpad you get.Battery:Apple has made it easier than ever to access the battery on its new laptops. No longer do you risk marring your pristine machine's finish with a coin. Now, all that you need to do is push two latches and remove a small cover to obtain access to both the hard drive and battery. Also, the batteries are smaller, which is nice if you are carrying a spare. What is interesting to me, though, is that apple styled it after the original iPhone, with the aluminum and black plastic two tone thing. As far as battery life is concerned, its great, as long as you use the 9600M. Once you switch it to the GT, it starts sucking power like there's no tomorrow. Overall, with normal use, (like web surfing, video chatting, and listing to music) I get about 3.5 to 4 hours of battery life. When I really start using this beast, and yes, it is a beast, (Adobe CS4, Logic Studio, Final Cut) I get a somewhat pathetic 1.5 to 2 hours. Oh, well. Can't have it all, can we?SSD:While the SSD is an added option, I thought it would be a good idea to include it in a the review, because it is a serious option that many consider. First off, for those of you who don't know, an SSD, or solid state drive, is a replacement to the hard drive in your computer. It is basically a giant usb stick which has no moving parts, which means increased durability. To prove it, some Samsung engineers even dropped it from a building and it still worked. A SSD also increases the speed at which your computer accesses, reads, and writes data. Because there are no spinning platters, data is accessed much more quickly. And, as an added bonus, it is impervious to magnets. (To the best of my knowledge. I know what you're thinking, and PLEASE do not try it.)Design:This baby is a cold, hard, stunner. The black keys and trim around the display, coupled with the aluminum body and silver trackpad, are purely sexy. Top that off with a glowing white Apple logo, and ding! ding! ding! We have a winner. For me, its the little things that impress. The perfectly machined speaker holes and the hidden IR receiver and iSight camera really show how the brilliant folks at Apple stressed after every single detail, no matter how small or insignificant. In redesigning their notebook line, Apple showed that they make powerful machines. Not white, plastic toys. The only complaint that I have is that there is not enough difference between the designs of the MacBook, and MacBook Pro. I mean, speaking from a purely design point of view, why shell out a thousand dollars extra for something that looks just like the cheaper version?Performance:Lets start with the facts. On our Xbench tests, our MacBook Pro, as configured, scored a coveted 175. Lets compare this to the previous generation MacBook Pro, with 2 gigabytes of RAM, and a 2.4 gigahertz Core 2 Duo processor. That scored a 50.  Yeah, that's right. In the words of Steve Jobs, \"Its a screamer!\" Also, after throwing pretty much everything Main Stage and CS4 could throw at it, this puppy still didn't break a sweat. As a final test, we put Windows Vista Ultimate 64-Bit on it using boot camp. After taking all Windows Vista, the worlds most demanding operating system, had to throw at it, it scored a 5.7 out of 6 on the Vista Experience meter! This thing's unstoppable.Conclusion:After using this exceptional machine for a month, I am proud to report that it is worth every penny. It is truly worth an upgrade to anybody who can afford it. In addition, Apple's initiatives to make this notebook `green' make it even more appealing. This is destined to be a very, very, successful product.Alex Carlson-- The MacTips Podcast","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

{"Title":"Impressive size, fast, solid feel, but with a caveat...","Author":"Twiddles42","ReviewID":"R2I9AUUTY6QWD8","Overall":"good","Content":"I do a lot of photography, graphic design, and web design.  I recently bought a 24\" iMac (the $1799 model with the 120GTX discrete video RAM) and am loving it.I had a choice:  Spend $2500 for a Windows license of my Adobe products... or replace my Windows laptop with a Macbook.So I bought this Macbook.  Vista turned me off of Microsoft for good.  System requirements are asinine, which also means higher power requirements to do the same things I can do on the Mac.  I've worked with PCs ever since  Windows 1.0 -- and loathed the registry in Win95.  But I digress...  no more Windows.  I throw an Apple and broke the Windows.  :)I only mention price as a downer because the laptop has only 2GB of RAM and whose display contains a TN panel.  I was hoping for a M-PVA or better.  Still, looking directly at it, color shift is minimal.  Still, my iMac's H-IPS panel monitor blows it away in terms of gamut and shadow detail.  Not that 2GB is _bad_ or anything, but the screen was a disappointment for a $2000 notebook.As usual, OS X rocks.RAM is inexpensive, so to up this to 4GB is no ordeal.And I'll be honest:  This thing is light and has a very solid feel.  A comparable Windows laptop (think $1300) is twice as thick and needs far more than 2GB of RAM to make use of it.  I'd rather have efficiency and quality for a higher price than another piece o' junk to be upgraded all the time.I'll keep major photo editing on the iMac because of its superlative display (no $500 PC monitor even comes close; more TN garbage but larger so the flaws become even more apparent), but this is capable of most design work that doesn't require pinpoint color manipulation.  And there's plenty of that that can be done too.","Date":"May 1, 2009"}

There are plenty of reviews which go into great detail and can answer all the questions you may have.After owning this MacBook Pro for 4 months, I just wanted to say that I am happy every day that I made this purchase!! This is simply a stunningly well designed, solid notebook. I have had 5 or 6 notebook PCs over the last 10 years and none have pleased me as much as this one.It may be more expensive as the recent Microsoft commercials choose to point out, but the premium I invested has been repaid with the highest level of satisfaction I have ever had.","Date":"April 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Buy direct from Apple","Author":"Lizard","ReviewID":"R3782UPGHQ75QU","Overall":"good","Content":"The product is great. For both work (software development) and play (World of Warcraft) this machine suits me just fine.However, if you have an Apple store handy, I recommend you buy there instead. From the first time I turned on the laptop, the dvd drive made a loud noise every time I turned it on or woke it up from sleep. I took it to the nearest Apple Genius bar and they agreed it was wrong, and offered to trade in for a brand new one. Then they found out I bought from Amazon, so they couldn't do that. Instead I had to mail my laptop to AppleCare and wait for them to say there was nothing wrong, and then send it back fixed(!). Weirdness of AppleCare aside, I could have started using my laptop a week earlier if I'd bought it from Apple.","Date":"March 5, 2009"}
{"Title":"Excellent hardware, but sharp corners!","Author":"G. Bartley","ReviewID":"R1WQNFF3LBTBA0","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought one of these the day they were released.  However, every time I would get up from using my laptop for a drink or potty break, my wife would steal it!  She was hooked.  I told her that we had to get a laptop for her so that I could use mine.  We went to Best Buy and test-drove a few cheaper PC/Vista laptops.  None of them even remotely stacked up to the quality of the aluminum unibody MacBook Pro.  She -had- to have a 15.4\" widescreen LCD that could be viewed from sharper angles than sitting directly in front of the screen.  She -had- to have a backlit keyboard.  She -had- to have a glass, button-less touchpad.  That narrowed it down.  She -had- to have a 15\" unibody MacBook Pro.All-in-all, we love just about everything about our laptops.  My only complaint is the sharp edges.  The 90-degree edge where your wrists wrest is uncomfortable for any lengthy coding or writing sessions.  And the notch cut out in the middle below the touchpad has VERY sharp corners.  I have actually nicked myself a couple of times on it.I would actually give this laptop a 4.5 out of 5 because of the edges.  However, Amazon doesn't support half-stars, so I rounded up.Oh, and this laptop made me a \"switcher\".  I bought a Mac Mini as an HTPC a few years ago, but never used it much.  Now, with this laptop, I never touch either of my high-powered Vista gaming rigs.  Sure, gaming on a Mac leaves a lot to be desired, and I haven't had any luck with the virtualization software for gaming (VMware, Parallels), but that's not my primary usage.  I'm a web developer and use an array of applications.  If you're a hardcore PC person, give a Mac a spin.  You'll find you can do anything on a Mac that you can do on PC.  It's a little unfamiliar at first, but it is just so much easier and cleaner-feeling and nearly hassle-free.","Date":"March 4, 2009"}
{"Title":"Macbook Pro = Excellence","Author":"Socrates \"Nick\"","ReviewID":"RB265OQ06N3LT","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently bought a new Macbook Pro after my old one died (my fault!). I cannot express how much I love this new aluminum (unibody) Macbook pro. The first thing I noticed when I got it was how gorgeous the LED screen was. I mean this is probably the best LCD I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant and black levels are excellent. Yes, there are times when the glossy screen makes it difficult to see, but unless your always in a very bright room, the benefits of the glossy screen make it a much better screen. Its a pleasure watching 720p movies on this laptop. The 2.4 Ghz Core 2 duo is fast and should provide more than adequate processing power for most people. Its only 5.5 pounds and me being a college student,its very easy to carry around. I mainly chose the Macbook pro over the Macbook due to the screen size and a much better LCD screen. Don't be fooled, just because both screens are LED backlit, the panel is completely different. Overall, If you can afford one, pull the trigger and you will love it and have no regrets buying one. Whether its watching HD movies, gaming, or Photoshop CS4, this powerful laptop can handle it all. Oh and its doesnt get too hot like the earlier macbook Pros","Date":"February 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Amazing machine","Author":"Smart Little Magpie","ReviewID":"R11A3T2ESFND8U","Overall":"good","Content":"I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","Date":"December 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"C. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows","Author":"Eagle Vision","ReviewID":"R3L7OKJPVR55VJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!","Date":"December 30, 2008"}

Espenschied \"ScoDal\"","ReviewID":"R2VGRT0I45JFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.","Date":"December 14, 2012"}

The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.

Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

This review is for the Macbook Pro 2.4 GHz and 2GB RAM. This is my first mac and I have had very little experience with mac before this purchase. I have had this computer for a few weeks now so I feel like I can provide an accurate review.Design: Absolutely beautiful! It seems like they really thought everything out. The magnetic latch and magnetic power cord are genius and very nice features. The computer does seem very sturdy and well built.Screen: I know many complaints are about the screen and it is indeed reflective. HOWEVER, I have yet to have a problem with reflection and the screen is vibrant, I love it.Hinge: I have read complaints on the hinge being too weak. I have not experienced this with mine and would say the resistance is about perfect. I can tip the computer at a very steep angle without the screen falling.Trackpad: This was one feature I was a little concerned about. I did experience a few problems with the trackpad but the update from apple fixed that. I can honestly say this is probably one of the greatest features of the machine. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the gestures and not having a dedicated button. Now, I feel like all other machines should have this trackpad and I really miss it when I am using other machines.Keyboard: This is a personal preference but I love the \"Chicklet\" style keys and it feels great. The backlight is nice to have also.Performance: This machine is fast! I have the Adobe CS4 Design premium loaded on the machine and it handles it with no problem. All other programs open and run amazingly fast. I have yet to have any problems with performance. Also, the machine is very quiet and stays cool. Battery life seems to be fine but I have not really put it to the test.Compatibility: I have yet to experience any compatibility issues. I do have Windows XP running through VMware Fusion 2.0 and it works pretty good (Separate review for this product). All my electronics and printers just worked...sure is nice.Value: So far I am very happy with my purchase. The machine runs great, looks great, and I am happy that I made the switch. I do not miss my PC at all. You will pay a premium for a Mac but it is a premium product.

{"Title":"15 year PC con-vert to Mac. THIS model MacBook made me do it.","Author":"Kevin Quattro","ReviewID":"RYB98AZ7KNOB6","Overall":"good","Content":"What can I say? Maybe it's my age catching up with me. I am not sure. I know that I was just tired of all the mess there is in keeping a PC up to date and always running. Drivers, inter-application support, all of this is just something PC owners deal with and have gotten use to. I'm tired of it.I found the iLife suite of applications a perfect answer for everything I needed. iPhoto, iMovie and of course iTunes (which I was already using on the PC along with my iPhone) are just a joy to use. iPhotos \"places, faces and events\" are super cool. And it's amazing how easy it is to get photos in and tagged. Everything about OSX just flows easily and never gets in my way. Everything works together smoothly and nothing competes with each other. i.e. WIndows Photo Viewer and Media Player both wanting to manange your pictures and videos DIFFERENTLY. Typical PC reply is \"oh just download this other app and install this service and then run this codec pack and set this registry entry and you're all set'\"  NO...I'M DONE WITH THAT. iLife and OSX WORK.Now to the hardware.I liked the previous generation MacBook Pro. It was missing some things though for the price. For one, it seemed to not really offer much in build and features I couldn't get elsewhere much cheaper in a PC laptop. This was not to say I would buy a PC but it meant I was looking at the MacMini or possibly even the iMac. Something I didn't really want to do. I wanted a laptop. So I waited. Another year with the PC...then finally these new ones hit.I was blown away by the features videos and when I got to handle one in person...WOW. They are thinner yet completely SOLID. Picking one up or just smashing the keys and you feel like you're using something God would use. I can rest my fat palms on the faceplate without worry. The new black backlit keys are MUCH easier to see and feel great! The buttonless touch pad (the entire thing is a button) is amazing. It's like the iPhone except with the addition of a button. Which is perfect. Be nice if the iPhone could get this feature some how. The gesture support is spot on. It's the first time I've ever used a touchpad and NOT wanted to get a mouse instantly. You can really use it all day and it's transparent. It operates so smoothly. FINALLY.The sound from the speakers is much improved. iTunes in the background or jamming out loud is very clear and full sounding for a laptop speaker. Nothing sounds harsh or crushed. They are laptop speakers mind you, but for that, they are the best I've heard.The display is very clear and off angle is nice. I find the contrast to be pretty good and the 3D performance to be awesome. (and should be with a 9600). The auto switching to the slower power saving 9400 is a pretty neat trick too. I play World of Warcraft and EVE-Online and they both run quite smoothly. When running on battery there is a performance hit with the cycled down cpu and slower 9400, but you'd expect that. I also tried Team Fortress 2 via \"Crossover for Games\" and it ran very smoothly. With only a couple of small display glitches.My only real complaint is the lack of USB ports, it has two. I really wish it had TWO more. My model has the express slot instead of the mini card slot. I find you have many more expansion options with the express slot. Including putting in your own mini card reader. So why limit your options?Finally, Amazon's price was $200 cheaper than Apple's. I got no tax and free 2 day shipping on top of that, pretty sweet.","Date":"September 29, 2009"}

What a difference!!  I've never had a laptop with such a long battery life which is key because I travel a lot for work.  It's also super light weight so it doesn't bog me down when I'm carrying all of my work stuff through airport security.  I've had it for about a month now and have not experienced even one single problem.  Transferring my files was a cinch, but it takes a minute to get used to the new operating system.  I watch movies on it, do presentations on it, browse the internet and check my mail.  So nothing terribly intricate, but I feel like my internet connection is way more reliable than it was on my old computer.I can't see any reason to go back to a PC and probably never will.  I have an iPhone and syncing up everything is also really easy now.  OH! And I can't forget iPhoto and Garage Band!!  What GREAT applications.

I bought a top-of-the-line HP, custom built with all the best components, and thats exactly what it feels like - a bunch of high-end components screwed together.  Even though my HP looks much better on paper, its feel and performance are not up to the standards of the MacBook Pro (yes, I use both)!My HP has more memory, a faster CPU, a larger and faster hard drive, a bigger graphics card, and a Blu-Ray drive, but my MacBook is faster, looks better, NEVER crashes, and requires little to no administration (forget about virus protection, disk defrag, autoruns, etc...).Apple creates an extraordinary product because of its tight control and vertical integration, and that's reflected in the high price too.  But be warned...  GHz to GHz, GB to GB comparisons with HP, Dell, Toshiba, Sony, etc...  mean very little here.  This computer beats them all, despite the numbers.

{"Title":"The PowerBook is back!","Author":"J. mcnalley","ReviewID":"R3QKDLG6UD6STC","Overall":"good","Content":"My last portable mac was a 1GHz Titanium PowerBook - the TiBook. Since then, I've been waiting for a suitable replacement. After a few years of weak aluminum G4 \"PowerBooks\", I switched over to a G5 Tower. A few more years later, I wanted to move back to a portable machine and started looking at the new unibody MBP.1. The new MBP is as fast and quiet as a PowerBook should be. The late G4 machines always seemed underpowered at the Apple Store. The early Intel machines were either too loud or too hot. The MBP is just right.2. Style is back. The previous generation of aluminum machines always struck me as a matte-gray version of the Snow iBook/MacBook design. That design works very nicely in brilliant white and matte black, but felt clunky to me when executed in aluminum. The new unibody design does a great job of mixing a glossy black display with a block of carved aluminum.3. Power too. OSX is Unix and a GUI in one well-integrated system. Everything good about OSX that has been written elsewhere applies here.4. Upgradability. Open the battery cover and you have access to both the HD and the battery. 250GB is plenty for me today, but when I can get a 2.5\" 1TB drive spinning along at 4200 RPM, the upgrade will be easy. All the screws appear to be phillips now, so I won't need my T8 driver anymore.5. Magsafe is a big win. The old power cables were very easily damaged, and easily damaged your mac6. The DVD drive is finally where it belongs - on the side! Actually, I wish I could order a MacBook Pro without an optical drive at all. Who uses optical media anymore?7. The new trackpad is simply great. I was going to order a nice laser mouse to go along with the MBP. After 15 minutes with the new giant trackpad, I don't think I'll ever plug a mouse or external keyboard into this machine. I wish apple made external trackpads for desktop computers.","Date":"April 11, 2009"}

I'm using it mostly for email, web browsing, digital photography, iPod (audio books, music), and remote access to work systems.  Following optional packages are installed: iLife, Office for Mac, VMware Fusion, Windows Vista, and various Windows programs on Vista. The system seems remarkably stable; it stays running for ages without needing to be rebooted.  The transition from Windows to Mac has not been difficult though I miss the Windows keyboard shortcuts for moving around and have yet to learn their counterparts on the Mac.The only real complaints I've got about the MacBook Pro are: 1) it requires a proprietary video cable (Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter) to work with a 30\" external monitor and 2)the display contents (text, images) periodically become blurry/unreadable requiring me to put the system to sleep and wake it up to reset the display.  I'm using a Samsung SyncMaster 30\" display but have seen several reports of other people having the same problem with other 30\" displays including the 30\" Apple Cinema model.

Every thing just works fine, no bugs, no hassles. This Macbook Pro is a 2008 model, but I found it very powerful and fast compared to my Vaio FZ-180e.The only annoyance had nothing to do with the laptop conception or functionality: it came with scratches on the right side of the lid. Also, when I installed aditional memory I found a lot of dust inside it, which made me wonder that this notebook could have been in some showcase at Datavision Computer Video store in NY, from where it was delivered.I've tried to contact the store by e-mail through the proper service at Amazon's site, but received no word about it. And since I'm not in the US right now, I just got stuck with a new computer that looks old. So, the reason I rate it no so good is due to its handling by the store, not because the quality of the equipment which I think it is superb.","Date":"September 12, 2009"}

I went through three of these unibody MBP's and wound up opting to just get a full refund. All three I owned, plus the display models in my local store had warped lids meaning, when the notebook was closed there was a noticeable gap between the lid and the bottom of the machine. When you picked up the machine you could actually feel the lid moving down.. This is unacceptable for such an expensive machine from a company that claims to pride itself on quality. One of the machines had a faulty optical drive and two felt as if there was something loose and clunking around inside the casing when I picked them up, even when they were turned off. I was lucky enough not to get one that had a loose battery cover, tons of dead pixels, or slanted keys on the keyboard. These all seem to be common issues with these new mpb's. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of quality control.This is a beautiful machine but, if you have an apple store near you, I'd suggest buying it directly from the store so that if there is a problem you can go right back there and deal with it immediately.","Date":"November 4, 2008"}
{"Title":"This is a \"Pro\" in every sense.","Author":"J. Shea","ReviewID":"R284YNFG61TCBF","Overall":"good","Content":"In March 2008, I decided it was time to upgrade from a G4-based laptop to one of the new Intel models. I deliberated back and forth whether the lower priced MacBook would be sufficient or whether to pay the premium for the \"Pro\" model. Ultimately, I decided upon the MacBook Pro for these reasons.Construction qualityThe aluminum case of the MacBook Pro reminds me of a product made by the Swiss. The build quality is outstanding for a mass-produced device. It feels very substantial, and all the pieces fit together nearly seamlessly. The MacBook's case, however, is made from a high-grade plastic rather than metal. It's nice ... but I found the front edge of the MacBook's case a bit sharp on my wrists as I typed.PortsCompared with the MacBook, the MacBook Pro provides an additional USB port plus Firewire 800. The latter is desirable for people who work with video and external drives that have Firewire 800 connectors. The ExpressCard slot is useful for future expansion and services such as wireless broadband (EVDO).KeyboardKeyboard experiences are subjective; but I find the keyboard on the MacBook Pro the most comfortable of any laptop I've ever used. It feels solid and responsive. Plus, its backlighting is helpful when typing in dark environments.Dedicated videoUnlike the MacBook that shares system memory for video (integrated graphics), the MacBook Pro has a dedicated video processor. This is beneficial for driving large external displays and running graphics-intensive applications.Is the MacBook Pro worth the $700 price differential over a MacBook? That depends on whether you are a general home computer user (i.e., e-mail, web browsing, iTunes, word processing) or someone who uses their laptop for more advanced purposes. My user profile is more in the second category. Also, since I intend to keep this computer for three years, I figure that the premium breaks down to about $233 each year. This seems reasonable to me for something I use every day.In view of the additional quality and benefits that the MacBook Pro offers, I think its higher price brings with it commensurate value. It's hard to imagine even finicky laptop users being disappointed with the MacBook Pro.P.S. -- There are two 15-inch MacBook Pro models. I bought the 2.4 gHz \"entry level\" model. It is the better value. I do not feel the 2.5 gHz MacBook Pro is worth the extra $500.Also, people who care to add system memory (beyond the stock 2 gigabytes supplied by Apple) ought to purchase it from a third-party vendor and install it themselves. It is a simple process.","Date":"March 12, 2008"}
{"Title":"Finally, the perfect desktop replacement","Author":"Jason","ReviewID":"RAGIRU3TFA2QP","Overall":"good","Content":"Short and Quick ReviewThis model is worth the 500 difference between the entry level.  The screen is beautiful, the new LED Displays are great, better color depth, more color, the laptop doesn't get as hot as previous versions.  Everything works, it is very fast, and this laptop replaced 2 high end workstations + 2 high end laptops (A dell with workstation class graphics card, and 17 inch macbook pro).  I can edit 1080p high def video in real time with no slow down, edit my 12mp raw files in real time with no slow down.  I can play the latest games like Call of Duty 4 maxed out on windows vista at native resolution with no slow down online.With the beefy 250gb HD, ability to upgrade to 4gb of ram, the 512 graphics card, and 6mb cache, this machine is a complete replacement for me, and revolutionizes my life, work style, and workflow.It is worth buying, and definitely better than the 2k version, by leaps, read my longer review for more.Longer Fuller Review.The new macbook pros are fantastic!  I had a 17 inch core 2 duo before,  it was nice, but it didn't do everything I wanted or needed.  I was forced to keep my mac pro, and my custom built windows PC for running the applications I need, and the ability to play games (I do some freelance game design, as well as photography and animation work)I grew tired of having so many workstations, but what can you do when you need the power?  Apples new macbook pro has answered my needs.  I have wanted a laptop with a 512mb graphics card for years, it has never happened until now.Previous to this laptop, my laptops have been \"toys\" the only close workstation I had was a dell that cost close to 3k, and would break your back to carry it (but it had a 512 workstation class graphics card!)With this laptop, I have sold my other machines, it is all I need, or want.  If it meets my needs and expectations, it should be able to meet yours easily.The reason you buy this model, is because of the graphics card, and the increase in l2 cache on the processor.  The 2k model has less cache than last years santa rosa model (3mb compared to last years 4mb) this model and the 17 inch has 6mb, as well as the 512mb graphics card, dual core processor, and the ability to use 4gb of ram.After getting the laptop, I use bootcamp to repartition the harddrive (did not need to reinstall OS X, was able to do this on the fly to install windows)  I split it up to give me 165gb for OS X, and the rest for windows.I need to use specialized software that requires windows, and these programs also require very high end workstations.  The life of someone in 3d is not easy.  This workstation takes care of all my needs.  I'm running the 32 bit version of vista ultimate (the 64 bit is horrible, do not run it)  I use windows to run the programs I need (mainly zbrush, unreal engine, and 3ds max)  I can and do have maya, and can use it on this partition as well as os x thanks to the dongle, but I cannot use my creative suite software on windows, because of adobes licensees.  (though oddly enough, I can run Lightroom on both platforms)On my OS X side, I run maya, photoshop, after effects, and final cut studio (with shake 4.1, yes I need 2 compositing programs)  I have no problems running these programs on this system.  I can render out quickly, everything is snappy.  With the 8600 geforce (opposed to ATI) maya is very responsive, and I get very few render errors.  Dynamics are able to be rendered on this machine, and I can run simulations with ease.  Render times are quite quick, and this system is very responsive.I do photo editing, and this machine is fast as well (I upgraded to 4gb of ram myself for 95 dollars) my camera is a nikon d300,  which is 12mp,  I use lightroom and photoshop extensively, and at the same time with no problems at all.I also run maya and photoshop cs3 together all the time (with itunes in the background).With leopard, I find using this machine even better.  I can use spaces, and have maya on one screen, then I can swtich to another screen with photoshop to paint textures, or reference something, and go to another screen for safari or itunes.The touchpad is cool.  Even in windows, I can right click by using both fingers on the touch pad, and clicking with the bar, very smart apple!  it works in OS X as well (but you have to enable it)I bought the apple keyboard (not the wireless, as I need a full size keyboard) and that keyboard is fantastic, the best I have ever owned.  I love it.  I also bought the logitech g9 mouse to use as my mouse (I cannot stand Mighty Mouse)  this mouse is perfect, and similar price.  With the wired keyboard you get use ports on the side, so you can attach the mouse to the keyboard with no problems.  And it saves on clutter.For those who enjoy playing video games (I do help make them)  you will be happy to know you can play the latest games on PC here with great ease.  I can play call of duty 4, at native res of 1440x900 (on vista) with little to no slowdown.  Same for Unreal 3 (and all games that use this engine).  I can play Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 maxed out all the way, at the native screen res, with no problems at all.  I can play crysis, and bioschock (not maxed out, but pretty close).I have not been so excited about a laptop in ages.  I had the original powerbook and used it all over, but it was slow, it was something to use when on the road, and at school.  When the first macbook pro came out, I was all over it, the software was buggy, it only allowed 2gb of ram, and it was not practical as my only system, nor was it applicable for heavy use by me.  I got the 17 inch when the core 2 duo's came out, it was great, very snappy, and with the 256 card it was close to everything I need (but only 3gb of ram)  I skipped the santa rose, as It did not really address anything.  This model addresses everything.  With 4gb of ram, 2 cores, 6mb of l2 cache, and a 512mb graphics card, there is nothing I cant do.I edit HD video (1920x1080p) in final cut with no problems.  I composite this video in shake with 3d made in maya with NO PROBLEMS.  I play high end PC games maxed out with no problems!  (Call of Duty 4 is a hard game to run, this runs it and I can play it maxed at native res, online, with no slowdown at all).I work on my raw images from my nikon with no problems at all.  This machine is just perfect.  Everything works the way it should, and the way it needs to.The only complaint I have is they did not include remotes in this revision.  You can still access Front Row by using Command ESC and use that to view videos (which look very good on my HDTV).I should also note, if you buy another keyboard (such as the apple external which I highly recommend (the wired, not wireless)  You need to go into system preferences and turn off the optiion for F Keys, as this keyboad has an FN button, like the one on the laptop, and renders using your f keys impossible without pressing fn, turning on that option, makes your keyboard normal, and you can use fn to adjust the volume of your laptop.Right now I have this laptop hooked up to my HDTV using the supplied DVI to VGA cable, and a line out form the laptop.  I have sound on my tv (which I could pipe to a sound system if needed, or (what I do) have it piped to my wireless head phones).  This laptop is where it is at.Please, do not think the 500 dollars for this model over the other is not worth it, as it is very much worth it.  The difference between this model, and the 2k model is night and day for me.  It goes from a toy, I can use when on the plane, to my only computer!  And that is HUGE if you are anything like me.Now the difference between this and the 17 inch does matter.  If you get the 17 inch, you will likly not be playing the latest games at native resolution, and I plan on using this hooked up to my TV, so I do not need 2 extra inches.  If you will only be using the laptop, and have no plans on games, the 17 inch may be better for you.  After reading many reviews, the 15 inch has better response times, and everything is slightly snappier than the 17 inch, which is why I went with the 15.  There is not much a difference in size between the 2, the 17 is not much bigger than the 15, but for me, you could not get me to part with my 15 inch for anything.This laptop is perfect, get it, and enjoy it.  The design will likely change by the next revision (rumored in june / july)  this could be the last time you can get such a beautiful laptop, that works perfectly, and is everything you can want.5 out of 5, no problems at all.","Date":"April 6, 2008"}

{"Title":"Better value than new unibody MacBook Pro","Author":"Bullminator \"1080P\"","ReviewID":"R1BPM7BPE06CE4","Overall":"good","Content":"Background:I wanted to buy the new unibody MacBook Pro.Tried it at the Apple store and here are my findings and opinions,and comparisons with the March 2008 model (MB134LL/A - the one I bought and am reviewing).Display on unibody model is super glossy and very reflective - and has no option for matte finish.Keyboard on unibody model did not feel as nice as the March 2008 model.Unibody model is slightly larger - bezel width is more than the March 2008 Model.Also, the March 2008 model is a lot cheaper (about $700),and there is an additional $150 rebate from Amazon.Meaningful specs difference:2.5 GHz versus 2.53 GHz CPU in the new high end one,2 Gigs of RAM versus 4 Gigs of faster RAM in the new high end (I upgraded to 4GB myself for $60),8600M GT 512MB versus 9600M GT 512MB in the new high end (20-30% faster),250GB 5400RPM versus 320GB 5400RPM in the new one (more on this below),The new one also has dual graphics (use the lower power one for more battery),but I'd always use the higher one, which would lead to less battery lifethan the March model.Display:Like I said, I prefer matte finish (or a glossy that is not like a mirror).The default colors were a little dull, so I went to System Preferences/Display/Color/Calibrate andtweaked around and saved a new color profile. It is MUCH improved now - much better saturationand has the contrast of glossy without the reflections.Usage:In less than 5 minutes, I upgraded to 4 Gigs RAM - bought that for about $60 from Amazon.I am keeping my two original 1 Gig sticks in case I need them in the future.I have VMWare Fusion running Windows XP Professional for some of mymust-have Windows apps. I have given the VM 1 Gig of RAM and 40 Gigs of disk.Performance of Mac apps and Windows apps is superb.I am using a WD Passport 320GB USB drive for backups with Time Machine.Battery:Last about 2.5-3 hours with almost constant usage. The best thing is when I close the lid,it goes to sleep instantly, and wakes up instantly when I need it again, with no loss ofbattery regardless of how long it sleeps. That is VERY DIFFERENT from my experience withWindows laptops that lose battery even when sleeping. No idea why.Storage:It came with a 5400RPM 250GB HD. I bought a WD 7200RPM 320GB with a big buffer fromNewegg - I plan to swap out the HD - that  requires \"minor surgery\" so I am doing my researchbefore I do it this weekend. The new disk will be a lot faster, although the it comes withseems to be pretty fast already. I am swapping as I like doing stuff like that.UPDATE: I swapped the hard drive and did a full restore from Time Machine - it now is exactlythe same as my las back-up with all apps and settings, except with a bigger and faster hard drive.This \"surgery\" is t for the faint of heart. :-) And is probably totally unnecessary for most folks.Mac OS X:So simple. After using Windows PCs and laptops for over 15 years, I am amazed how easyand intuitive it was to use a new OS. I know Mac OS X is very powerful and I am just beginningto learn the advanced features to play with. Being able to run Windows XP in a VM with such a smallload on the system is very nice. I use software apps that are either not available on the Mac yet,or have much older versions on the Mac. This is not specifically about the MacBook Pro but thefact that the MacBook Pro has enough juice to do this is what is worth noting.Boot Times:When I shutdown and restart,  it comes up in 30 seconds or so. Much faster than my experiencewith Windows laptops. Here's the best part - if I put the Windows VM to sleep in my Mac,it comes back up in seconds! Much faster than Windows used to wake up on a Windows laptop!So for a portable laptop, the MacBook Pro is quite powerful and fast.Overall:I am glad I bought this model instead of the new Unibody model. This is by far the best portable computerI have ever owned. I've always felt that the MacBook Pro carries a price premium over \"equivalent\" ormore feature rich Windows laptops, but now I know why. They are better.","Date":"November 12, 2008"}
{"Title":"2 weeks into the switch","Author":"Software Craftsman","ReviewID":"R3BU15IBGYAQM9","Overall":"good","Content":"There was no reason for me to switch to a Mac product.  I've always have been intrigued, but XP was doing it for me day in and out.  My current Dell Latitude was on its way out and I wanted something high quality.  I couldn't find anything that comes close in build quality/finish to the Macbook Pro.  Asus makes some nice notebooks but I didn't want Vista, with all of its assorted issues and XP doesn't seem like a sound choice given its looming end of life.So now I have my Macbook Pro.  As a software developer I was drawn to the idea of a UNIX shell as a first class citizen (sorry Cygwin).  The toughest part is learning the keys.  In XP I could move around an IDE effortlessly, with keys: home,end,ctrl-arrow etc.; not so on the Mac keyboard.  This proved the most frustrating.  The lack of the forward delete is also a disappointment but I hear there are keyboard mapping solutions.I installed VMware Fusion and XP for initial comfort and to ease the transition off windows.  BTW, Fusion is amazing.  It feels like it's native, and it's definitely faster than XP on my current Dell.  With Fusion, I can map drives, cut and paste and access servers between the two -- it's all very fluid.  Full screen your Fusion in a different Expose window and you can quickly swap back and forth between Mac and XP.Now the downside.  In the first few days I experienced no less than 4 crashes, where it had to be power cycled.  I haven't had any issues since, so I'm going to conveniently forget.  Firefox crashes still, but no more than it did on windows, and maybe less.So in conclusion, Mac was the right choice for me.  High quality in and out and at a decent price.  The interface is pure eye candy and orders of magnitude superior (usability-wise) than XP.  While there will be some pain points in learning, it will hopefully be worth it.  Get VMware Fusion and install Windows for when there is no Mac alternative.*UPDATE* I have now had the macbook pro for 2 months.  I'm really enjoying some of the UI features, such as expose and spaces more and more.  The hotkeys are awesome (e.g. show desktop, lock/start screensaver).There are however a few recurring problems that I have been experiencing.  I'm going to detail the top two.  The first issue is the screensaver hotkey stops working at times.  This is a huge issue because it is also the mechanism for locking my computer, and I cannot leave my desk w/o locking it, so I must either close the lid (sleep) or restart, which fixes the issue.Now for the second issue: often when I try and restart/shutdown, it does nothing, then a minute later tells me that Finder failed to quit and I should quit Finder then try again -- great suggestion Apple, given that you CAN'T QUIT FINDER!! So now I have to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to kill it or run \"sudo shutdown -r now\" from Terminal.So in my latest conclusion, my mac is not living up to my expectations of reliability.  I was led to believe, by many in the mac community/stupid commercials, that Mac was the panacea from XP.  The Mac user interface is *unmatched* and that along with the UNIX foundation were and still are my original reasons for choosing Mac.  My previous XP Pro notebook however was significantly more stable.  The reliability issues are getting more and more annoying and I just hope Apple is able to resolve and restore my faith in their product.  Lastly, I would change the star rating to three but it won't seem to let me.","Date":"April 25, 2008"}

{"Title":"Ideal desktop replacement","Author":"DC Machead \"DC Machead\"","ReviewID":"RC10E01A1S46K","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this computer to upgrade an older MacBook Pro (MBP).  It is indeed a very significant upgrade to my 1st Generation MBP.  I won't get into nitty gritty tech specs, as most people I know buy Macs because they want to use their computer, not the other way around.The screen is a lot crisper.  My understanding is that it's an LED-based screen, which results in increased battery life.  On the topic of battery life, out of the box I'm getting 4.5-5.0 hours worth of battery life--dramatically better than the 3 hours max I got out of my 1st gen MBP.The processing power is dramatically increased, as well.  I never had trouble running anything on the old MBP until I got Parallels--I had to upgrade the old machine to 2 GB of RAM to get performance to an acceptable level and even then it was sluggish.  Not the case with the 2.4 Ghz MBP with 2 GB of RAM.Boot up time is significantly increased with this machine and the wireless seems to have extended range versus the prior version.  I attribute part of this to using an 802.11n base station, but I also notice that I pick up more WiFi access points near me, as well and some of them are Belkin 802.11g.The one thing that I do find annoying is that Apple changed the assignments for the function keys.  Having used Mac laptops for ~5 years, I found this to be very annoying.  I was able to work around this by changing the key assignments back to what I know.In all, a phenomenal upgrade in terms of what you get out of the box, raw processing power, boot time, and increased battery life.

I remember when windows 95 first came out and how bad Macs sucked back then.  However times change.  The main thing that did it for me was that I could have both windows and OSX on the same machine using boot disk.  The verdict, I am now a Mac man.  And no I don't have the little apple sticker on the back of my car window in case you are wondering.Boot Disk works flawlessly and when I boot up windows (mainly for work) it is like I have a PC, (a really bad a** PC). When I first got it I thought I would be spending most of my time in windows using OSX for \"fun\" however after a week I realized that OS X Leopard blows windows out of the water.  Every aspect is better.  Let me say that again:  EVERY aspect of Leopard is better than windows XP.  I haven't found one thing in windows that I like better that what Leopard has.  Apple simply has the best user interface engineers on the planet working for them.  Now to be fair I haven't yet used Vista (haven't felt compelled at all so far based on what I have seen) so I don't have a basis for direct comparison to MS newest product.Wireless works great, bluetooth works flawlessly.  OH and the DVI out is amazing!  I can plug the DVI out to my receiver and watch full screen HD video on the plasma!  I tried this with my old PC, even bought a new video card to do it, but frankly it couldn't hold a candle to the mac.  Macbook pro also has Optical audio out for connection to the receiver, very nice. Speakers on the machine are better than average for a laptop but still not anything approaching audiophile quality.The machine comes packed with software that is actually useful, fun and has no crap on it.  ILife is great and easy to use.  The display is crisp, clear, vivid, etc, etc.  The best screen in the business.If I had to pick a con, I'd be price, though in comparison it is really not but a couple hundred bucks more than the equivalent PC.  What you get for that extra cash is a better user interface, better styling, smoother operation, faster performance. Personally I'd rather spend a few hundred bucks more and get more enjoyment, more functionality, and in the end more usefulness from the computer than to worry about saving $200 and end up with something that feels like it is just some \"tool\".  Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.","Date":"October 7, 2008"}
{"Title":"Happy Camper","Author":"mczilla","ReviewID":"RV0ZJD0NVOUSN","Overall":"good","Content":"It took me several months and a lot of research and in-store inspection before I bought this thing, and I'm happy to report no regrets so far. Actually, I'm glad I waited until the latest version came out. The new LED screen, faster processor, larger hard drive, bigger graphics card and included Boot Camp are definite pluses over the older models.I'm a graphics professional migrating from Windows and an old CRT, so the glossy screen doesn't present me with any new problems, and I find the rich colors and crisper text to be an advantage over the matt, but I admit this is a subjective call. The keyboard has a very easy and positive feel; lack of a numeric pad is no problem since I rarely used it when I had one. Serious design & bitmap work is done with an Intuos tablet anyway. The OS boots so much faster, and adapting to Leopard after Windows has not been difficult at all. Replacing the big monitor and brain-box with something this small had me wondering at first, but I now consider it to be a revelation.  Once the display is on it seems more than adequate. And there's always the satisfaction of Apple's \"slickness factor\" - beautiful industrial design, and an operating system that just makes me want to say \"cool\".","Date":"April 2, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"Thomas W. Meagher \"keypusher\"","ReviewID":"RNKSI28JINX44","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought mine refurb ~6 months ago.  I have had no problems whatsoever, and it has met or exceeded all demands I have placed at its feet.  This a powerful and well designed laptop in every regard.Operating System:  #1 Reason to buy an Apple laptop.  I run Windows and Linux on my desktop, but for a laptop there is no reason not to go with Apple.  OSX is better in every aspect than Windows, and getting Linux to work well on most laptops is a pain in the @%$.Screen - #1 Reason to get a MBP over a MB.  Get the matte screen.  It is simply the best laptop screen on the market.  Hands down.  I have received compliments on the actual screen from people sitting next to me.  When you see a Dell or even a Lenovo next to the MBP, their screen just looks incredibly sad, dull and washed out while the the LED backlit matte MBP is very bright and crisp.Size/Weight:  Weighs the same as the normal MB, but slightly larger.  Five pounds is actually quite light for a laptop of this caliber.  I would prefer a 13\" form factor but the MBP wins in other regards, and the larger screen is certainly welcome.  If SIZE is a major issue, you might want to consider the MB, if WEIGHT is the main issue, consider the MBA.  If you carry around a bunch of other heavy stuff or need to travel ultra-light, this may not be the laptop for you.  However, if all you carry around is a laptop, a (paper) notebook, and some papers or a book, it's not an even an issue.  I carry this laptop a few miles walking almost every day and I don't even notice it.Quality: Top notch.  Feels solid, unlike many PC manufacturers Apple uses top quality components for ram, motherboard, power supply, etc.  If anything fails, Apple support has always been refreshingly helpful and accommodating.Metal Case:  If it wasn't for the white plastic case, I might have bought the regular Macbook.  I think the metal case is more professional, but this may just be personal taste.  Realistically, the plastic MB is probably more durable and alledgedly gets better WiFi reception.Power:  Used for extensive coding, video editing, photoshop, video playback, running Matlab simulations, etc.  Hasn't failed me yet.Battery:  Decent battery life, nothing amazing.In conclusion, if you need ultra-light, get a Macbook Air.  For all-around use or students, I think the Macbook is the best bet.  This is because I slightly prefer the Macbook keyboard, mag-latch, and form factor.  But for the pro user that wants power, expandability, an amazing screen and a professional look, the Macbook Pro is the best laptop on the market.","Date":"April 13, 2008"}
{"Title":"10 minutes to freedom","Author":"Califrisco","ReviewID":"R2K5OOLBEEOO5L","Overall":"good","Content":"A mere 10 Minutes after I opened my new MacBook Pro, I had it up and running and I am writing my review here with it.  And that 10 min. would have been lessened had I not dawdled over the Apple screen cleaner and the user guide and so on. This is a sleek and fast machine; though it can get a bit warm on the left palm-rest I am loving this new machine. I'm adding Parallels and VM Ware Fusion as well to port over some of my Windows files. [BTW: You need Fusion only if you intend to run any 64-bit OS. And if you have XP like me Parallels supposedly runs it faster and more seamlessly according to Macworld]I am looking forward to a low-calorie Windows life now. :)Amazon even beat out a Mac Mall an identically spec'd refurbished MacBook Pro with this deal and with far less rebate hassle too!I could not have had a better experience with this entire purchase than through Amazon. Their tracking and quick delivery is exemplary. And this experience IMHO, is what the Mac Malls & Fry's of the world should be shooting for.Kudos both to Apple and Amazon.","Date":"March 20, 2008"}
{"Title":"Excellent Machine - Not going back to a PC anytime soon","Author":"King Cotton \"RWH\"","ReviewID":"R2VKWJLSO13HHW","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Apple MacBook Pro MB134LL/A 15.4\" Laptop (2.5 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive) from Amazon last month.  I love it.  I've been using PC based laptops for work and play for 15 years, and while I have dabbled on MacBooks (of various types) with friends over the years, this is my first Mac purchase and the first time I am using a Mac for work purposes.  In short, I could not be more satisfied with the machine itself.Externally, the 15.4 model is a sight to see.  It has an elegant, polished look about it.  More importantly, it has a sturdy feel to it.  So many PC laptops, including name brands (Dell, Compaq, etc.) have such a cheap, plastic feel about them, as if you could twist a little bit and something cheap would come flying off.  Not the MacBook Pro.  The aluminum shell and the solid body give it a confident feel, like it could take a little abuse if necessary.  The keyboard is just right: large keys, rightly placed, with a good feel--not to soft, not to much of a click.  That the FN function keys come set to serve as hardware options by default and Fn keys (F1, F2, etc.) only while holding down the Fn key seems backwards ... but its a simple switch in Preferences.  The ports on the sides seem sturdy and well place.  At first, I thought I would miss having all the ports tucked away on the back of the machine (as in the case of many PC laptops), but in the real world this has not turned out to be so bad after all.  Given the $2500 investment, I purchased a Speck clear cover and some ApplePeelz stick-on wrist guards, just to the keep the dings and sweat/grease stains to a minimum.  After all, I'm planning to take this machine for the long-haul.In terms of performance, the elegance on the outside is matched by the gears on the inside.  It really moves along.  I ponied up for some more RAM, making it a 4 gig machine, because I figured if I was paying $2500 for a machine, I may as well trick it out.  I run a typical suite of office programs - email, web, Microsoft Office, iTunes, syncing to a smartphone, scholarly research software, etc. - and the MacBook does great.  8 to 10 programs open at a time and not hesitation whatsoever.  And unlike Windows after 6 months, the overall system performance has not lagged.  I can put the Mac to sleep 6 times a day, and it always wakes up ready to go, full speed ahead.Sure, $2500 is (these days) a real investment in a laptop.  So if you just want to drop a little coin for a simple, what-you-pay-for is what-you-get machine, don't get this one. But if you are looking for a machine that looks and runs great, with an operating system that is simple (but not simplistic) and has a polish and flair that Windows has never even approached, then consider this model.  I love it.","Date":"June 23, 2008"}
{"Title":"Get it while you can","Author":"Ryan","ReviewID":"R2UA95HNHX4CYK","Overall":"good","Content":"Amazon:Superb.  Bought the MacBook pro on Monday, received it on Thursday using free shipping.  The rebate is VERY easy to complete.  Took me about a minute to complete.  Seriously.  All is done online and you can check the status as well.Why I got this model:Spent a lot of time researching whether to get the early 2008 model or the late 2008 model.  Went with early 2008 for several reasons:1.) Price - saved hundreds versus the new Pros (even after all rebates from Amazon)2.) Matte screen - I got the MacBook Pro primarily for photography and didn't want glare causing me to keep bobbing my head when editing images.  I get enough headaches as it is.  Also didn't want it to limit where I work.  This may not be a big deal for everyone, but it was the main reason I even started to look at the older models.3.) More for the money - got the 2.5ghz, 512mb vram version for less money than the new 2.4ghz 256mb vram version.  Also has more L2 cache for whatever reason.  A speed test I came across on MacSales shows that this version of the MBP is actually faster than the new ones in about every category.  You can find the comparison in their memory sales section.4.) Perceived value - Just about three months ago, this model would have gone for the cost of the high end late 08 version brand new from Apple.  Now that the new version is out, I got this older version for significantly less than that.  Feels like a steal.MacBook Pro itself:As many people have written, I too am coming from the PC world over to the Mac world.  I have made the transition and, so far, am loving it.  I've always bought HP computers in the past and have purchased an Intel Core 2 Duo machine from HP...this computer breezes through everything way faster than any HP machine I've bought.  This is the first computer I've ever used that can actually keep up with me!  The build quality is solid.  It really is making working on a computer fun.  In fact, I wouldn't be writing this review if it weren't for the fact that I'm having fun just typing on the keyboard.  I've read some previous reviews saying that this laptop gets really hot...that hasn't been my experience.  I've been working on it for a solid 2 hours and it's very comfortable on my lap.  Yes, it's a little warm, but just warm.  Not hot.  Granted, I haven't been playing any games so if the warmth comes from the GPU, then I suppose I haven't given it a full test in that regard.  It's completely silent so far (again, something the GPU might change).I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I did A LOT of research on which model to buy, so there was no doubt in my mind that I was making the right decision.  I like the unibody case on the new Pros, but nothing else really makes me want to go that route.If you're considering this model, buy it while you can.  I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase so far.","Date":"December 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Notebook Perfection","Author":"Mutulu1","ReviewID":"R3CYKM36TF8IKO","Overall":"good","Content":"The macbook pro quite simply is the best notebook on the current market.  Currently on my third notebook ( the white & black macbook) I decided to upgrade to the pro.  If your like me and actually don't mind a larger notebook screen and paying for improved features, then this notebook is for you.  First off, you're getting a 2.4ghz processor (avoid the 2.5ghz pro, $500 for 1/10 faster processor and 50 gigs is not worth it to me), 200 gigs, dvd superdrive, 15.4 inch screen in either glossy or matted.  By the way, for those not sure which screen to choose, definitly go with the matted.  It's the best screen currently offered.  If you believe like me you purchase a notebook to mobilze it, then you are going to mind glare, shadows, sun, and other images showing up behind your screen.  It also makes sense if you are using the mbp for photo or video editing.  Glossy does not give you the true version of your images or video before moving them to dvd or image paper, rather what you look @ on matted is exactly what you're printing.  Gamers might prefer glossy.  The aluminum finish is flawless as well as the upgrades trackpad features similar to those on mba and the iphone.  I don't find myself using those features much, but it comes in handy when needed.  This machine is also an eye catcher.  i stopped @ panera bread w/ my wife after work to find 6 people asking me to see the pro.  This mbp is my primary computer (have a desktop pc and wife uses macbook white) and it's pretty much all i need.  Everything is on this computer and it doesn't miss a beat!  This machine is costly running @ 1,999.99.  However, you have to weigh the options; If you want a desktop notebook that has a large enough screen, tremendous features and fast processor and would like taking it on your deck, couch during a game, or to work, get this.  If you just need a machine parked @ the house for multiple users (family of 4??) this might not be the investment for you.  I prefer a computer for each person to avoid confusion.  Also recommend, Apeture 2, iWork, and time capsule for back up.  The only con I can give this machine is its opening latch button in the front.  I find it a bit small and you have to give it a good poke to open it.  That's pretty much it, get this machine!!","Date":"June 2, 2008"}
{"Title":"This is not a review, just a warning about 17\" Macbook Pro screens","Author":"Nick \"CellGeek\"","ReviewID":"R1DUONHOD5QQR2","Overall":"good","Content":"Hi everyone.  I am the happy owner of a 15\" 2.2 GHz Macbook Pro from the last generation.  I am upgrading to the 17\" in the near future.  This is NOT a review but simply a warning.  The Amazon listing is INCORRECT.  The 1680x1050 display is NOT lit by LED's.  It is lit by CCFL's, ONLY the 1920x1200 upgrade screen is lit by LED's.  This upgraded screen is NOT available on Amazon.com  (Please note that ALL 15\" Macbook Pro's are LED screens)There is a large difference in the quality between these two with LED's being superior.  The whites are much whiter, the contrast is better.  Though they claim both are 300nits brightness, I find the LED's to look much brighter (possibly the combination of  whites and the better contrast)  Also know that Apple claims the LED screen's (that being the 1920x1200 screen) efficiency gives it 30 extra minutes of battery life over the CCFL versions (1680x1050 screens)  I hope this helps.  These are really excellent notebooks.Please remember this ONLY applies to 17\" Macbook Pro's, ALL 15\" Pro's are LED.","Date":"March 7, 2008"}

{"Title":"Worth the 16 day wait!","Author":"Chef Paolo","ReviewID":"RAS5HN28C078L","Overall":"good","Content":"When I left for the US I knew that Apple will be updating the Macbook Pro so I sold my iBook back home. I assumed it would come out by mid-January during Macworld and I was very willing to wait at least a couple of months for it to come. Suffice to say it didn't happen with the bloody Macbook Air coming out so I ended up using a Vista PC *groan* for a month and went on a EEE PC *sigh* til yesterday. For those looking for a computer avoid Vista like taxes and go Linux or better yet a Mac.When ordered I had to wait 16 more days til it reached my doorstep as only Apple had it on stock until recently. I then bumped it to 4GB RAM as it was cheaper to buy it separately and do it yourself.So what's new you ask? Unlike older MBPs it runs really cool so the the heat sink fan just needs to operates at 2000 rpm most of the time. This simply means I can comfortably put the notebook on my lap and it doesn't sound like a dust buster. Battery lasts longer and I got the much talked about multitouch. Faster processor, more video memory and larger hard disc drive differentiates this base model from the previous generation.","Date":"March 14, 2008"}
{"Title":"MacBook Pro--Mostly Good","Author":"retired for GREAT","ReviewID":"RWRO4A99EKXNP","Overall":"good","Content":"I replaced my five year old iBook with this MacBook Pro because I did not want the glossy screen of the new MacBook and because the Amazon price after rebate for the early 2008 version of the Pro was close to the price I would have had to pay for the late 2008 MacBook.The Pro is a great machine and, of course performs much better than my old iBook except in one respect--wireless reception. My iBook never had any issues anywhere in the house. The Pro is MUCH weaker. At first I thought the Pro was defective, but after a call to AppleCare and a visit to the Apple Store Genius, I saw that it just required a stronger signal. Since I don't take my laptop out of the house, that's not as big an issue for me as it might be for others.I've repositioned my modem/router and I'm considering buying a 'n' router to replace my 'g' version, hoping it will work better.I do think that Apple should have been more attentive to wireless performance. I'm wondering if the new metal-cased MacBooks will have the same weak-kneed wireless reception.","Date":"November 22, 2008"}

Ma","ReviewID":"RP64H8KQWXZDU","Overall":"good","Content":"I know I am not the first person to go over the two main issues, get the XPS at a huge discount and of course glossy or matted.  I wanted to share my experience with everyone and hopefully save you some time or even hassle.First off I specced a Dell XPS M1530 and saw that with some coupons I could get a much better PC at almost half the price.  Since I am not an advid Mac User this seemed like a better deal. I figured why pay more for OS X when Vista suits me just fine.  So I press the send button and placed my order.  Not being able to sleep at night I decided to see/feel the XPS at my local Bestbuy store.  First off the exterior of the Dell is quite nice and has a sturdy feel to it.  But when I opened the unit, the keboard wrist area looked kind of cheap.  I then booted it up and tried some videos / movies / games.  The one thing you will notice right away i that the speakers are AWFUL.  I was not expecting Bose like sound, but the sound reminded me of an old 386SX computer I use to have where all you needed was beeps and dings.  I went home cancelled my order with Dell.I knew I wanted th Apple MacBook Pro but then glossy or Matted.  After reading tons of reviews and opinions I decided the only way is to go down there.  I went to Apple and started looking at the screen side by side with pictures/movies/games.  Hands down in every aspect Glossy was much sharper clearer and color more vibrant.  I chose Glossy.Then of course do I get the 2.4 or 2.5 Mhz.  While I don't doubt that for some the $500.00 upgrade is needed, for most of us it is not.  By the time most programs (games) require 512VRAM the notebook would probably be outdated processor wise.  Added with the fact that Intel charges Apple about $75 for the upgraded chip it seems odd that Apple could slap us with $500.00.At the end I bough my MacBook Pro 2.4Mhz Glossy and LOVE IT.  I also took the apple salesman advice, \"you could always buy an external matted screen if you need to.\"  External matted screens are generally less expensive then their glossy counterparts.  There you go best of both worlds.I hope I have helped some of you but at the end of the day single best advice is to go and see for yourself.  That's what I did!","Date":"May 27, 2008"}

I use to have a 11.1 inches laptop and that was really arduous on my eyes at times.7. Backlit Keyboard: Most people say this is for eye-candy. I would contest this. I work mornings and nights and I don't like to wake up other people in the house. Moreover, it is profligate to turn on lights when you are the only one using it. With the backlit keyboard, I am able to work effectively in the dark.8. iSight: This is one of the features I was aghast at. My old webcam as the Logitech Notebook 2MP autofocus. That quality on that is perspicuous. The iSight is not far off.9. Price: I got this when the new macbook pro came out. ~1650 (AR) for a high end macbook pro is unheard of.10. Performance Comparison: After looking at numerous sites on the performance comparisons between this macbook pro and the new one, I found out that there are not much differences to justify for the $1000 increase in price for the new one. Plus for the new one, in order to use the 9600M GT, you need to restart the laptop which defeats the purpose of gaming on mac.11.

{"Title":"MacBook Pro Delivers","Author":"Tgunnnzzz","ReviewID":"R2TOEW69SE4LF3","Overall":"good","Content":"The Apple MacBook Pro is an exceptionally amazing product.  I own the 15\" and have been completely satisfied with it's performance and abilities.  The stylish casing and ease of use made it my first choice when buying my newest addition to the family.  We loved it so much my wife also purchased one as well.  The first thing you will notice about this laptop is it's metal casing.  Providing a sturdy casing to protect the important internal parts, it is also very cool looking.  Opening it up you first are drawn to the black keyboard that illuminates according the light in the room.  Apple has done a great job with this feature. This is also prevalent in the screen as well.  Depending on the light in the room, it will dim accordingly automatically.  Once this machine is on and running you will be amazed at how easy it is to use.  When transition from a PC to a Mac I would recommend you purchase the one on one sessions for only $99.  You get a year of personal training sessions to help you learn how to use the Apple's software and hardware.  Transitioning for me only took about a month to get confident enough to use strictly Apple software.  Given you can install any Microsoft software including the OS like Microsoft XP.  Apple lets you retain a PC feel if you want by allowing Microsoft operating systems to be installed.  Try installing Apple's OS on a PC, won't happen unless you are a genius computer wizard.I purchased the iWork suite and have been completely satisfied with that as well.  I am able to quickly produce some professional quality materials such as newsletters and brochures.  Powerpoints are a breeze with Apple's default templates.  It is very simplistic and easy to use.  Overall I have been completely satisfied with my purchase.  I would highly recommend anyone in purchasing one.  While they are considerably higher priced, you get what you pay for.  I prefer quality over cost and the Apple is well worth the price.","Date":"February 19, 2011"}
{"Title":"MacBook Pro - beautiful computer in every way","Author":"Rishi Agrawal","ReviewID":"R222VJ5LHT4768","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned one of these computers for two years now. As a student that is working and stressing for an average of 17 hours a day, this computer is amazing.It's entirely dependable, and even after two years, it doesnt feel like it has slowed down at all. The computer looks great, performs great, and the constant updates and enthusiastic fan community really make sure that every aspect of the computer is great.Before purchasing this computer, I had two main concerns, cost and compatibility.Compatibility - As an intensive user of Microsoft Office, I was concerned with the fact that the Mac version seems very crippled. Turns out that with the proper software (I like VMWARE), you can install a Windows system and run the windows version of Office. It's a great solution, and the computer will not slow down much. As for all the other Mac programs, I love all of them. When I first started using my Mac, I couldnt get over how integrated everything is; it really feels like it's YOUR computer.Cost - at $1200 (the price this laptop is listed at), it's a bargain. If the laptop cost any more, I'd definitely still consider a PC because there are some pretty inexpensive computing alternates.","Date":"July 12, 2009"}

The non-glare LCD screen is also much nicer to work when there are background lights. I simply cannot stand the glare on the new shiny screen.

{"Title":"A most excellent computer","Author":"Claude H. Suddreth \"Opinion Expert\"","ReviewID":"RT5WPAUHDMJD4","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased my first Apple product in over 20 years - a brand new \"old\" model (non new unibody) MacBook Pro 15 inch which was on sale with rebates, as Apple is flushing inventory to make room for their new unibody models.  My computer was the 15 inch version, 2.5GHz, 250GB Hard Drive, NVidia 8600 512k graphics, with the Glossy screen and 2GB of Ram.  I did upgrade the RAM to 4GB for a grand total of $60 and 5 minutes of my time.This computer is MARVELOUS.  It is unlike any other laptop I have ever seen in so many ways.  No fans to over heat under the case - you can sit this laptop on your - lap - without worry.  Extremely thin design.  The body is made of aluminum and is apparently used as some type of heat sink.  Screen is CRYSTAL clear.  Speed is ASTOUNDING for such a small laptop - equal to one of our servers at work.I installed Parallels virtualization software, and installed my existing version of Windows XP Professional and Office 2007 on it.  It boots this virtualized machine and runs office FASTER than my previous DELL which had a 1.8 GHz Dual core processor, running them natively.  And this from within the Mac OS 10.5 Leopard operating system.I also purchased a pair for Shure SE310 earphones for AMAZING listening enjoyment, a Corsair 32GB USB Flash Drive, and a Western Digital My Passport Studio 400GB external hard drive for high speed Firewire 800 time machine backups and auxillary storage.  All of which worked perfectly right out of the box.  Just plug in and go.If I had to make ANY complaints (when I don't really have anything to complain about), I would mention only 2 things.  First the Airport built in Lan adapter seems to have somewhat weak reception.  I am sitting in my living room about 12 feet away from my wireless hub as I type this - and I am receiving only about 60% signal strength.  This is sub standard when compared to my Dell Laptop which would show well over 95% in this same position.  The other thing I notice compared to my dell is that the built in external speakers are - underpowered - to say the least.  Full volume on this computer would be equal to less than half volume on the Dell.  Neither of these is a large issue.  The airport extreme card does seem to allow me to move all over the house without losing signal - it just seems to fall off from strong to medium rather quickly.  From the external speaker point of view - buy a set of Shure SE310 earphones, or maybe a set of Klipsch Image X10's if you prefer - and you will never want to listen to external speakers again anyway.All in all - a 5 star computer.  Excellent product Apple!  Can't wait for you to price cut the 17 inch models with the release of the 17 inch unibody at Macworld.  I may become a 2 Macbook customer - albeit with your older discounted models.Cheers!","Date":"January 7, 2009"}
{"Title":"Macbook Pro","Author":"Maury Swoveland","ReviewID":"RLMINIENFT6V","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been using the Macbook Pro for over 2 months now. I find it a delight to use. Stable, fast and a very user friendly keyboard. I installed iWork, MS Office 2008, Fusion 2.0 and Windows XP for general use. I have been working on both my Dell Vista system and my Macbook and find the Macbook more user friendly and stable than the Dell Vista system. Most of the teachers I work with use only Windows and I was concerned that the documents that I produced with iWork or Mac Office would be a problem, but that has not been the case. All have been very easy to open and use. I am using Fusion and Windows XP Pro very little since the programs on the Mac work perfectly. I can even write PowerPoints on the Mac (MS Office 2008) put them on a Flash drive and read them at school on my HP Vista system without any problem.I have used Windows for many years and finally got fed up with Vista hanging, crashing and it loading time. I purchased the Mac to get away from Microsoft and have had great success. If it were not for a few problems with Keynote (maybe I will be able to solve them) and converting to PowerPoint I would not be using any Microsoft products! As a long time Windows user, I recommend you switch to a Mac, you will not be sorry.","Date":"November 30, 2008"}

{"Title":"The best laptop I have ever had for work","Author":"Mike \"Movie Buff\"","ReviewID":"R1V6IF4HQB2D28","Overall":"good","Content":"I've gone through several laptops, my most recent was an Alienware 51m which only lasted 1 1/2 years. While playing a game, the video card died, right after my warranty expired. And lucky for me, the laptops parts are no longer made so it sits as a coaster on my coffee table. Recently I've used a Apple iBook until my principal was able to buy a few MacBook Pros. I quickly traded in my iBook for this thing of beauty. I never looked back!I'm amazed at how fast this computer loads and works. The OS called Leopard is very stable and easy to use. I've found that Macs are very user friendly. The screen is very bright (you can adjust this) and a nice addition is the fact that the keypad area is lit. The speakers on the side seem very powerful for a laptop and the superdrive being in the front instead on the right side is a nice touch. The 15 inch screen is perfect.  I've seen iLife '08 take a beating by reviewers and by keynote speakers when I go to professional development. iMovie on this laptop (part of iLife '08) is a little more confusing than the previous version. I love my iTunes though. The wireless card sometimes acts a little quirky at my job trying to hook on to the network but I am chalking this up as our network issues (we got quite a few issues with it) and I dont blame this laptop. When I go home, it does a great job detecting wireless networks.If you need a laptop strictly for work, this is a great laptop. The only minus, is that it gets very hot sometimes. Sometimes it gets extremely hot when charging. Ive notified Apple concerning this and they said it's normal however, if you feel the heat you will quickly remove your hand and say, \"Ouch!\" I cant see that as normal but so far so good. For now on, if I need a laptop, I get an Apple. I still love m PC desktop that I built myself though!","Date":"October 9, 2008"}

I had previously played with a PowerBook and was thinking about getting a Mac, but not really knowing anything about the operating system or compatibility with other machines not running Leopard kept me away. Now, after getting the MacBook Pro, i have to say there is nothing more simple and intuitive than the Mac OS. A fine product, with attention to detail. As they say in the ads, even the power plug is a feature. Overall, the Mac seems to have been thought of as a jewel running everything with no errors rather than as a computer. It looks great and works just as well. 10+","Date":"August 30, 2008"}

{"Title":"Everyone should own it...","Author":"G. Powers","ReviewID":"R1PA938ELI83Q","Overall":"good","Content":"This is not just an appliance computer, as some Windows fanboys would have you believe.  I work with computers for a living, which means everything from RHEL file servers, to Windows Citrix servers, and everything in between.  The nicest part about the Macbook Pro is the fact that this machine can either be just an email appliance for your wife or mother-in-law, or a serious Unix machine and professional workstation (read: command line tools, development, audio production, multimedia production such as photoshop, etc.).Both my wife and I bought identical machines (Macbook Pro, 15\" matte screen, 2.4 Ghz Processor, 2 GB RAM, 200GB HD, etc...), and we both absolutely love these machines!Besides the fact that they are just amazing to use on a daily basis, the fit and finish is beyond compare (IMHO) to any other laptop on the market (aluminum case, great lcd, decent video card...although beware to NVIDIA GPU CUDA developers, the 8600 mobile chipset isn't the best...still decent, but there are better for strict GPU computation)As with anything, there are cons to this machine....first and foremost, it runs HOTTTTTT!  The case is aluminum, and therefore conducts heat amazingly well.  When running vmware inside the Mac OSx, the computer will become incredibly hot. Second thing that I personally find rather disappointing is the web based multimedia capabilities out of the box...quicktime just isn't up to par with Windows Media Player.  And finally, the lack of support for mainstream games can be a little annoying, but running windows xp under bootcamp usually solves this issuee...although, I don't like that I have to boot into another OS to play games.Anyway, overall, I would say that everyone should seriously consider owning this machine.  The price is a bit high for most people, but I can honestly say that I would have happily paid another $500 for this machine, as I believe that you get what you pay for, and Apple has done a great job when engineering the MacBook Pro.","Date":"September 14, 2008"}

I've always thought that the quality of the Apple Powerbook was superior to what I could get (as a primarily PC user).Fast forward, and the user in our company needs a new computer to be able to run the latest Adobe design products.  So let me go over the noticeable differences:1 - Fast.  Even compared to other modern dual core notebooks.  This computer rockets along.2 - Smaller.  This new machine is thinner and lighter compared to the old Powerbook G4's.  It wasn't something we were expecting and the end user was quite thrilled.3 - Better power cord.  The magsafe connector is a WONDERFUL upgrade from those G4 power cords that had a lifespan of about 6 months.  While some people have reported problems with them, the power cord that ships with this model is \"version 2\" and after a couple of month's use has shown zero issues.Once again, I believe that the Macbook Pro has shown itself to be a well engineered, solid machine.  Amazon has amazing next-day-air shipping rates on this model, and it does everything that we need it to.  I believe that Apple has stayed ahead of the pack when it comes to quality construction in their notebooks.  Even better, our user was instantly comfortable with the new version and up and running in next to no time.","Date":"June 20, 2008"}

I've owned PCs and Apple Macs, but the Macs far exceed the performance and life of any of my previously-owned PCs.This is my second Mac notebook computer; the other is a  black MacBook 2.16 GHz Intel which I have passed on to my wife. When I purchased the MacBook Pro I was able to transfer my older media and document files, settings and everything from the MacBook with ease. I purchased this notebook for my media work and one of my favorite things about the MBPro is the multiple ports it has (USB 2.0/FireWire 400/FireWire 800/Express) along with a regular DVI (digital) monitor port, something lacking on the MacBook and a nice feature for media professionals or people looking to make presentations right from the laptop.Everything boots quickly and the included system software (OS X \"Leopard\") is solid all the way around. Combined with the Intel processors, this is a wonderful performer.The GOOD:Speed.Stability of OS X.Lots of great features in operating system.Easy migration of info, docs and files from older Mac OS X-run machines.Vibrant 15\" screen.Backlit keyboard works great in dimly lighted rooms.Built-in speakers have better placement.Large storage capacity (200 GB for this particular model).Multiple ports (USB/FireWire 400 + 800/Express).DVI monitor connector.MagSafe charger port.Decent battery life for a larger laptop.Easy wireless setup and connectivity.Beautiful, sleek styling.The NOT SO GREAT:Feels a little heavier than other laptops in its class. Not a big deal.Still not crazy about Apple Mail, the e-mail client in OS X.One thing I did find--a very minor OS X system glitch--was my \"Movies\" folder was not recognized (I received an error message that read something like \"...volume cannot be found\") when I booted for the first time after setup. I have heard this happening to others, but this was an easy fix that I discovered within seconds:1.) From the launch tray at the bottom of the screen, select the Finder. It will open in a separate window.1.) On the left side of the Finder window under the PLACES menu, select your home icon (looks like a little house). In the right window pane you should see these folders with mini icons in the middle of them: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Library, Movies, Music, Pictures. If you don't see one or more of these folders, move on to #3 below.3.) Go to the menu at the top of your screen and select File > New Folder. A blank folder (no icon) labeled \"untitled folder\". You will want to rename this folder with the name of the folder that is missing from the list above. In my particular case I was missing the \"Movies\" folder, so I renamed it that. As soon as that happened, the Movies icon appeared in the center of the folder and...PROBLEM SOLVED!BOTTOM LINE:The Mac OS X operating system combined with a magnificently built machine equates to a speedy, reliable and slick laptop that is perfect for portable media work. This is well worth the money and based on my last 20 years of Macintosh experiences, it will be a machine that will give great service.","Date":"May 31, 2008"}

{"Title":"Still works amazingly","Author":"Lisa","ReviewID":"RXRRUAAHY1TGJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I got this two and a half years ago when I was about to go into a video production major. I almost went with a Dell instead because of the price, but I ended up getting this so I could use Final Cut and Logic, which are both Apple only software. I'm really glad I got this one. It still works great.All of the PCs my family has owned have gotten very slow and freeze or crash constantly within a year or two. This has not slowed down at all and it has rarely frozen (once in a while there will be an issue when I'm using Corel Painter X, but I assume that's the software's fault). There have been maybe two or three times when I've gotten a message on screen that said I needed to restart because Mac OSX failed unexpectedly, but it's so rare, that it's not that big of a deal.I have Final Cut Studio, Logic Studio, and other programs loaded on my computer and they work great (especially considering this is a laptop). It's great to be able to record bands in the basement and just carry my laptop down there instead of needing a separate computer.One thing I don't like, maybe the only thing, is the noise the DVD drive makes when I put a CD/DVD in. It also doesn't play/load CDs or DVDs if the laptop isn't on a level surface (like if it's on my lap), but I have friends who have Macbooks and they don't have either of those problems, so it could just be mine.","Date":"November 18, 2011"}

After a month and a half, I'm still frustrated with some of the nuances of the change.  There are printer compatibility issues, for example, and iTunes ratings and playcount data did not transfer over from my pc. Navigating pages is also slightly different, and after years of doing things the pc way, old habits are dying hard.  I was also led to believe that the Mac never crashes, which is a myth.

FYI--Apple has recently redesigned the 17\" MacBook Pro with the same glossy display as its siblings, however, you can \"upgrade\" to a matte display for an additional $50.  Imagine that!This Macbook Pro is a gem.","Date":"January 28, 2009"}

Was a PC user up until now.  I'm sold on how easy the Mac is to use.  I especially like Iphoto for organizing pictures, Imovie for video clips, and even garageband for creating music and laying voice over onto karaoke songs.  All software maintains a similar look and format and is very simple to navigate. And - when you have nothing to do, taking goofy pictures with Photo Booth is fun.","Date":"January 28, 2009"}
{"Title":"4 1/2 stars for a good product","Author":"Maverick \"Mav\"","ReviewID":"R3P8SP62RLU5BR","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an outstanding computer, especially for its features and operating system functions.  My gripe with it is that the 5400 rpm hard drive is a major lagging player and does not unleash the full potential of your MBP.  I would get a new one - 7200 rpm - but doing so is a major pain and you could easily void the warranty.  Otherwise, everything is working just fine.I suggest you get the AppleCare protection plan as you might need it to protect your your (expensive) MBP.  I got it for 200 at e bay.You can get many free applications, including NeoOffice or OpenOffice (replaces MS office).Good luck!","Date":"January 27, 2009"}
{"Title":"Fantastic Laptop Near Perfect","Author":"Amy K. Yu \"Amy Yu\"","ReviewID":"R32YNVP1WNQU31","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the 15\" 2.5GHz model and this is my second Mac (also own a Mac Pro in addition to two PC's).  So far I love almost everything about this laptop.The weight is light and the laptop is very thin, and noticeably so next to our Lenovo Thinkpad. The build quality is superb, the keyboard is very very good, even better than the Thinkpad (which is legendary for having the best keyboards).The wireless connection is fast even though my router is two floors upstairs in the attic level.  The speakers are nice and crisp and can be raised quite loud.As for the operating system that is loaded with this laptop, Leopard, it's fantastic.  Very fast startup and shutdown times and everything just seems to work right.The one quibble I have is the display...it's brilliant with fantastic colors and is very bright but is not consistent across the entire screen.  There's a thin band on the right edge which appears slightly dimmer than the rest of the screen.  Also, the left half seems to be a hair brighter than the right half.However, to me, it's a very very minor nuisance.This is a wonderful laptop and to put it simply - It just works right.Coming from a fairly recent top of the line Lenovo Thinkpad loaded with Vista that was always sluggish, this laptop is a real breath of fresh air.I highly recommend this.","Date":"January 25, 2009"}
{"Title":"Great MacBook Laptop - even if discontinued","Author":"Paul G. Binder","ReviewID":"R1UD1UEIETGDLP","Overall":"good","Content":"I am really enjoying my Apple MacBook Pro 2.5G, even if it is discontinued model. The new MacBook Pro's are very attractive, but I am not too fond of the keyboard, and (most important), they no longer have both the Firewire 400 (MHz) and 800 (MHz) ports. I use a Sony HDV Video Camera, which communicates with the Mac via Fire 400, and I also use an external Media Hard Drive via Firewire 800. Yes, I know that I can use the ExpressCard, but I don't really need it as the Firewire 400/800 combo works just fine! My only problem is trying to collect my purchase rebate from Amazon.... The original description was for an on-line rebate, but when I tried it - it came back as expired. When I call Customer Service, they said I should have had paper work with the unit. None was included, so they were going to send me the forms... A week later, nothing has arrived, and I am nearing the end date....

Kayan","ReviewID":"R1LHEPYIZ4AC6E","Overall":"good","Content":"A current iMac or Mac Pro would have been a faster computer, but the price was right and, for a portable, I'm impressed with the MacBook Pro's capabilities. The most taxing things I use this computer for are World of Warcraft, video chat, and development work using Eclipse.Most of the time, I use this in a stationary environment, and have added an Apple (wired) external keyboard and a 2-button Kensington mouse. The laptop touchpad and keyboard are actually not bad to type on, but a full-size keyboard and mouse better suit me.Pros:- availability of a matte screen (option no longer available on current MacBook pros)- discrete video card (GPU) does a better job handling graphics-intense video games.- backlit keyboard is a nice bonus, even if you do touch type.- 15\" widescreen display seems larger than I thought it would be.- standard DVI output, not a proprietary plug.Cons:- if you tax the GPU, you can burn through the battery charge in an hour or two.- the bottom of the computer can get very warm, but I believe that's common in laptop form factors.","Date":"January 11, 2009"}

When I replace this one I will probably go with the 15\" model since the 17\" has been a bit big to be hauling around all the time (my notebook and Nikon are always with me).I've been using mine for Java Programming, Project Management, Photography, Web Site Development, Games and of course other graphics creation for miscellaneous projects. It occasionally runs a little bit hot but I expect it when I'm running Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Parallels with Windows XP running Projects and cruising the web all at the same time.One of the first things I did (and do) when I get a Mac is REMOVE iTunes (Floola instead), iCal and iChat (Adium instead). I install VLC, Adobe Reader, NeoOffice, Firefox, Eclipse, HandBrake, iSquint, iAlertU, OoVoo, smcFanControl, Transmission, The GIMP, MacPorts, Fink and the Developer tools available on the OS X installation DVD. I also install a plethora of Adobe stuff (Photoshop, Flash, Dreamweaver, Illustrator & Lightroom).I can't say a bad thing about my MBP. I also purchased the chicklets (metal) keyboard and mighty mouse. I have my own home workstations, but it is very common for me to ignore them in favor of using this MBP. I can't wait to see what next year's models are going to be like, that is when I plan on replacing this one with a shinny new one.","Date":"May 6, 2008"}

{"Title":"Much better than the new MacBook","Author":"Oneironaut","ReviewID":"R3UEOE0QVC9J4N","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Mac since the Macintosh of the late 90's...  what a difference a decade makes!  I LOVE this computer, but I'm glad I got this model rather than the new one and I'll explain why.1.  I love the all-silver look of it.  I don't like the black keys of the new ones.  Makes it look too much like an HP or some other kind of PC laptop.2.  I don't care for the new keyboards which have individually separated keys.  It just feels odd to type on, and the keys on this model are crisp and always feel brand new.  I love how it looks when the keys light up.3.  Matte display.  Glass screens really interfere when working with color-intensive programs.  And, as this is a portable, lighting conditions are going to constantly change.  I'd rather have no possibility of glare than have to always angle the whole computer just to get a good view.4.  DVI output rather than the new Macbook's specialized monitor connection.  Admittedly I haven't needed to hook my Mac up to anyone else's monitor yet, but if I do, I'd rather have the flexibility of a DVI cable than have to shell out more money for an adapter.5.  Firewire 400 AND 800.  The new Macbooks don't have the 400 port, which hasn't been much of an issue for me since my video camera has an 800 connector, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility that I might need to use the 400 port at some point.  This is, after all, a notebook for professionals, and I do a lot of video editing on Final Cut Pro.6.  The trackpad on this one still has a button to use.  The new ones are one single combination of trackpad and button, which sounds neat but sometimes you need the definite separation to avoid accidentally clicking something.  I guess that's why the new trackpads are larger, but still, I prefer the this version of it.The new Macbook does make some things easier, such as gaining access to the hard drive, but it doesn't make up for the smarter design of this version.  I got this computer just before they discontinued it and boy am I glad I snagged it!  There are so many neat options to play with and of course it's a big plus to have Windows running on it too.  Just add an external hard drive, and you have a computer that should easily replace any you might already have for daily home and/or professional use.  Well worth the money.","Date":"January 25, 2009"}

With Apple specific hardware designed for OSX you don't get the full functionality of Windows as advertised ie. still no games and no windows Aero due to such a low Windows Experience rating.

I did not need the more deluxe computer for my needs, but figured for only $300 more, it was worth it.  I was very surprised to find that the computer you sent me was last years model & that is why the computer was cheaper.  I did not read in your advertisement that the computer was last years model.  I am disappointed & have had trouble with warranty issues as Apple shows the computer being sold in 2008.  It took three attempts to convince Apple that I purchased the computer in February 2009.I would have definitely purchased the standard Macbook for $1,299.00 through my retail apple store & had the new model with everything I need & the convenience of saying I purchased the computer from them, which is always a plus when needing service or help with troubleshooting or any problems.I hope you will make this more evident in your advertisements in the future so people will be sure of what they are getting.Sincerely,Wyndell Williams,(206) 937-0550 - H(202) 903-7720 - M","Date":"March 26, 2009"}

Because of husband pressure and advice from the Geek Squad, I ended up buying this MacBookPro, which I've been using for several weeks.First off I do not like the silver plastic of this case. It feels cheap, and the computer runs so hot that I have to put a magazine under it to balance it on my lap. It really, really runs hot. I also don't like the old-fashioned matte screen, having been spoiled by my Acer's slick sharp screen. The screen is also smallish--although the diagonal measure is true, the depth of the screen is less than my other computers.The model ships with BootCamp, which works great, although you will have to purchase Windows VISTA separately if you're going that way. I have partitioned my hard drive 50/50 Mac/PC and am experiencing no problems. I use the machine as a PC except for iPod and photos. Apple also provided decent in-computer speakers, thank heavens, so you can play videos without using supplementary speakers.The keyboard is backlit in low light settings (you can turn this feature off). This is rather nice, but it doesn't make up for the touch of the keyboard, which doesn't feel all that great to me.Now is this machine were 1/2 the price, things would be different. But at this price point, I really am looking for something that is a bit more perfect.","Date":"August 26, 2008"}

The hardware was excellent: solidly built case, nice backlit keyboard, good feel to the keyboard keys, and glass-like screen. However, I did not like the installed operating system: Mac OS 10.6. In summary, I did not find it as easy to use as Mac OS 9 or Windows XP. I found using the mouse especially annoying: Mice I have used moved a screen distance proportional to hand-distance moved, and did not depend on the velocity of the hand, but in Mac OS 10.6 the screen distance moved also depends on hand velocity. Also, compared to Mac OS 9, I did not find the contents of the menus at the top of the start-up screen as well organized. Mac OS 9 had something like Windows XP's Start menu, both of which allowed one to navigate through OS settings and folders, but Mac OS 10.6 does not have this feature.","Date":"August 2, 2011"}

I've run through every laptop during those years and I must say that with the MacBook Pro 17\" is amazing.  The display is dazzling - clear and crisp enough to display HD images.  The keyboard is actually a pleasure to use.  The iPhone type tracking has immediately spoiled me.  Even the speakers finally have enough volume.  It's the best in breed.Why not 5 stars then?  Apple stuff is made in China with all the usual crap about \"Well, we're different, we don't allow exploitation and brutality.\" and are shocked, shocked to learn that the workers are exploited and brutalized.  It is all so clean until someone (see MacWorld UK or the Mail) reports in from China about the conditions of the factories and the exploitation of the workers. I abhor the fact that Macs are made in a slave state.  I think Apple should be made to advertise the fact more prominently in their hip adds:  Perhaps have a 12-year-old undernourished Chinese girl to represent Macs just to let you know that this product is helping to perpetuate a brutal, genocidal regime.  Maybe not so hip after all.So, great design.  Terrible company.  I still write Mac programs, but not with the same smugness that used to come with the marque.  The Apple programmers are amazing, creative, et. al: the engineering is consistently innovative if not always good.  Too bad all this talent works for Jobs and the rest of the unenlightened thugs running Apple.So, recommendation?

{"Title":"MacBook, Perfect Size & Power","Author":"Enzo","ReviewID":"RNZJLAXKACKYB","Overall":"good","Content":"I went back and forth between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Which one? Will it be powerful enough? Big enough...?Maybe a Sony Vaio would be better?I'm a Windows software developer but I'm going back to school for my MBA and I wanted a smaller, simple notebook for papers and internet communication for classwork. It needs to be durable and I need it to work without a lot of fussing around with system bits.After much research I chose the MacBook over the pro because of the smaller size and the fact that the aluminum on the pro although cool, can dent easily. The matte black finish on the MacBook is elegant, tough, and the build quality it top notch. Does the the black eventually get smears on it from your hands and fingers? Yes it does but just wipe them off every so often. It's not a big deal.IMO, aside from a few points in processor speed the major technical thing the Pro gets your over the MacBook is a dedicated video card. The card in the MacBook uses part of your system memory and that's not a big deal if you aren't doing complex things like 3D Rendering or gaming. Even most photo editing tasks on the little MacBook will work well *if* you have enough RAM. I recommend 2GB or more.My MacBook arrived and I couldn't be happier. I personally think the black is nicer looking than the aluminum model. And this thing is fast! It makes my dual Intel Windows tower at work seem pokey. The glossy screen probably has more glare than a matte screen but the trade off in weight and size is well worth it.Also the built in wireless Airport is great and reception is wonderful. Just turn it on and  available networks show up in your menu. It's really so much nicer than Windows. The bonus is that I can dual boot with BootCamp and run all my Windows stuff when I need to. I installed Neo Office (open source office suite) and now I can open and create all the documents for my coursework.Don't fool yourself into thinking the less expensive MacBook is less worthy for general computing tasks than the more sophisticated pro. It's very elegant looking and very powerful. If you don't need the power and size of the pro, I think you'll be happy and the money you save can be put toward other things. Maybe a new digital camera?","Date":"March 8, 2008"}

I was never interested in the Mac do to what I perceived as the proprietary nature of their systems and what I thought was an expensive price tag. Here is what I discovered when I purchased this model of Mac:1.  It just works.  The boot up time is less than half of what it takes my Windows laptop, and the shut down time (4 seconds) is only a fraction of the  30-40 seconds of my Toshiba.2.  It runs Windows Vista faster than my Toshiba.  I still need to run a couple of Windows applications, so I went through the VERY easy bootcamp installation of Vista.  It runs flawlessly and after having purchased Fusion for $79, I am now able to run Windows apps alongside Mac apps.  Simply incredible.3.  Battery life is great.  I can get 4 hours out of mine running in low power mode.4.  Why no card reader????  Almost all PCs now come with card readers to use with your digital camera.  Why does Mac not include this???  :(5.  It does NOT require the regular restarts that my Windows systems have always required.  Simply close the lid and put it to sleep at night, and the next morning lift the lid and you are back in business.  I can do this with my Toshiba but start getting errors in Windows after a couple of days and need to reset.  Also, my Macbook runs very cool (with little heat) in the sleep mode, thereby allowing  me to put it in my brief case in sleep mode without it heating up.  I could never do that with any of my PC laptops.  They would always heat up.6.  No virus software needed.  Happy, Happy, Happy.  Surfing the internet is faster because of this.  Also, opening a document in MS Word is faster because the Virus software is not screening it.I purchased MS Office and loaded it.  It runs great and is almost identical to its Windows counterpart in functionality.  But, Word and Excel seem to boot up a bit slower than the Windows versions.  This is one thing that I do not like.7.  I like the way the electric cord connects with a magnet instead of plugging in.  This seems handier and better in design, but I wonder if the magnet will still be as strong two years from now?All in all, I am extremely pleased with this Mac.  When you compare the price with the included features, it is only slightly more expensive than a comparable PC.  To me it is worth the extra $200.Actually what is going to make this very expensive, is now that my wife and daughter have seen my Mac they are both wanting to replace their PCs as well.  This is one expense I did NOT budget for.Thanks for reading.  Hope this helps","Date":"April 12, 2008"}

According to Amazon and Apple, one dead pixel is not enough to warrant replacement of a brand new computer.  I know it's one tiny pixel out of a million but once you notice it you always seem to see it.  It just seems to me that for $1300 you should be able to receive a computer without screen imperfections.  I wouldn't care about discoloration or scratches on the case but the screen should be perfect.  I don't buy Amazon's & Apple's excuse that this is acceptable: no Mac I've ever owned had dead pixels; none of my friends' Macs have dead pixels; none I've seen in Apple stores have dead pixels etc.  Had I purchased in an Apple store I could have walked in within 30 days and they would have swapped it out.  How can everyone I know and even my giant LCD TV not have any dead pixels but my brand new macbook has a permanent dot?  On-line buyers beware.(END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW)UPDATE:  AMAZON HAS COME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS AND SENT ME A BRAND NEW MACBOOK WITH NO DEAD PIXELS AT NO CHARGE.  After a visit to the Apple Store (to confirm that if purchased there, they would replace it) I gave Amazon one more chance.  Using the call-back feature, customer service instantly called me and without any hassle, told me that they would replace my defective Macbook.  Sure enough, 1 day later my new Macbook arrived via FedEx and after staring intently at each and every pixel, I am completely satisfied.  This is the kind of customer service I would expect, and makes me very happy to use and recommend Amazon in the future.A few things I've learned in this process.  If you're worried about pixel issues, as soon as you get your new computer, download a Pixel Checker program or change your background to Red, Green, Blue, White, Black (separately) and check for any stuck or dead pixels.  If there is a problem and you can live with it - enjoy your new computer, otherwise contact your dealer ASAP.  Also, I had much better results dealing with the telephone support people as opposed to trying to resolve this by email.  As long as Amazon takes care of its customers like this, I will be a lifelong user.I wish I could change the star ratings to 5-star but you're not allowed to edit that.  This is really a great computer.  Super fast and perfect for my needs.  Weighs 5 lbs which is fine with me - not ultralight like the Airbook, but it seems lightweight enough to me.  Leopard is a great OS and the bundled programs are fun and easy to use.","Date":"May 8, 2008"}
{"Title":"nice product","Author":"Curmudgeon","ReviewID":"R3JJWOCHNKX7BO","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a software engineer with twenty years experience developing system services for MS Windows and generic UNIX platforms. For the last ten years, my experience has been with MS based servers and workstations.  The last time I used an Apple personal computer was in 1980 when I owned an Apple II+.On a whim I purchased a MacBook running OS X 10.5.2 for my wife who has virtually no computer experience and avoids all things computer. She was not happy with my home MS Windows systems and she was not happy with the available portable computers running windows.She has taken to the MacBook like a duck takes to water. She likes the package design, the display, and the desktop layout. She does not have the experience to appreciate the thoughtful interfaces and bundled applications that come with OS X.  She just knows the entire package is enjoyable and not intimidating.Me - I like the UNIX foundation to OS-X.  Knowing the internals of both operating systems, UNIX is the clear winner when it comes to reliability, durability, predictability, consistency, and security.  Additionally, UNIX (with its open source variants) does not suffer from conflict of interest between operating systems and applications.  One always wonders if some MS Windows quirk exists to solve a development problem in some MS application.  I quickly put the terminal icon on the MacBook desktop so I could indulge myself with the UNIX shell command line any time I want ;-).I installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the MacBook in a few minutes.  I also added a third party optical bluetooth mouse in about thirty seconds. It took longer to install the mouse batteries than configure the MacBook bluetooth capability.Apple has a very solid package with the current MacBook. There is little that one needs to add to the MacBook.  It comes with just about every hardware interface available today.  It has ample processor, RAM, and hard disk storage for average users.  It comes with dual layer DVD RW. The bundled suite of applications is adequate for the full spectrum of casual computing (e.g., web browsing, email, chat, word processing, photo/video/audio processing).  Apple stuff is a bit pricy but you receive the value you pay for.If you want a good comprehensive companion book for your MacBook, I recommend David Pogue's \"Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual\".  This book is large and contains much technical detail but is very well written.  It is not for the casual computing novice that finds reading and comprehension tedious.I have used Apple support one time and found the wait to be acceptable and support engineer to be competent, efficient and attentive.  I have used MS support many times over the years and found them to be equally capable.I have not found anything I dislike about the MacBook after thirty days of usage.  My wife, however, would like the Apple logo on the lid to glow red instead of white when the MacBook is powered up.","Date":"March 31, 2008"}

I do much the same thing down here on Sanibel Island, where for another book I take my computer with me in my pickup, or on my bicycle, to dig up such details as beach parking lot spaces and hiking trail finds.As you can guess, I need good battery performance. And it's for that reason alone that I waited for this new-for-spring MacBook model, and the reason I'm so happy with it. For the most part I only use Pages, so I'm not much of a power pig, but this is the first laptop I've ever had that makes it all day in the field on one charge. Don't get me wrong, I'm not typing that whole time by any means, but I often leave my MacBook on as I walk around Disney or drive from one beach to another, often open it up to type in a paragraph or two, and usually get in a couple of solid hour-long writing blocks each day.From what I've read, the better battery performance comes from the brand-new Penryn processor these new MacBooks incorporate. I can't comment on that, as except for being able to install memory I'm not too knowledgeable about stuff under the hood. But I did test out the old 2.0 GHz model against this one at an Apple store, and I can tell a slight difference in speed. Visually this MacBook is identical to its immediate predecessor, model MB061LL/B.I chose this entry-level 2.1 GHz model (with simply the 1 GB of RAM) because, like I said, I really only use Pages, with an occasional Numbers spreadsheet or video-free Keynote presentation here and there. My 2004 iBook has been great except for its battery life; now there's nothing not to love. (My Apple store rep agreed with my choice. He thought the other new MacBooks, all of which come with SuperDrives, are worth the extra cash only for those who burn DVDs.)For what it's worth I've been a Mac addict since 1984. Over the years I've used 18 Macintosh models.","Date":"February 27, 2008"}

I am not a tech so this review is not going to get into tech specifics.The pros:Loading time is super fast - about 10 seconds from turning it on and I'm ready to go.  Same with shutting it down.I like that all the ports are on the side and not the back so you're not flipping your laptop around trying to get the right port.Easy to use - buy it, open it up, and it's ready to go!Weight - I think mine is just under 6lbs and I carry it to class with no problems.  It's also not bulky like a lot of other laptops.  It's slim, lightweight, and professional looking.Battery life is about 5-6 hours right now.The cons:I don't like the magnetic power cord.  I move my laptop around a lot and watch videos as I go to sleep.  As I move around inevitably the cord comes out without me knowing it and I don't find out until all the battery power is gone.Keyboard - took some time getting used to it.  Also, while typing for lengths of time (and who doesn't as a student?) I come away with marks on my arms from the corners of the computer.  I do like that it would be very very hard to get anything underneath a key.Another USB would have been nice, but it's not a deal breaker for me.Overall, I would buy this computer again.

I considered the MacBook Pro but since I don't do any heavy video editing, 3D or gaming there is little practical advantage to the Pro model. This is a fast little machine that hits a sweet spot of price, portability and performance. Build quality is nice, too. I think the black model looks a little bit better looking but I'm not paying a $140 premium for the color.(after hard drive upgrade price factored in)I also looked at Sony and Toshiba. (Don't tell my Mac friends) because I thought I might be able to save a few hundred bucks. I could, but not for a comparable notebook. It's true that you get what you pay for. Figuring in comparable specs, weight, AV/spyware software, and sound card quality there is really no Windows based laptop for less.At 5 pounds this is a nice and light computer. iBooks, and now I suppose, MacBooks have a good reputation for being tough enough to stand up to school kids so I don't have a problem with the plastic case. I was waiting until Apple announced an update and am glad I did. The faster processor is nice and finally Apple added a reasonable amount of RAM (2GB). The 160 GB hard drive is adequate for my needs and noticeably quicker than the 4200 RPM drive in my old laptop.Wi-Fi reception is pretty good, as is battery life. Both are a above average but not tops for laptops. The magnetic power connector is a great touch. I've tripped over power cords before. This should simply detach without tripping me or sending the MacBook crashing to the floor.The keyboard takes some getting used to. At first I didn't think I'd like the button like keys, but within a couple of days I found that I didn't notice. They do seem less likely to get crumbs under them than normal keys. I had a similar reaction to the glass screen. At first I was bothered by its reflectiveness, and quickly didn't see it anymore. It's there if I pay look for it but, usually just don't see it. And I like the punchier colors it displays compared to matte screens, as well as its ease of cleaning. There's no need for expensive specialty screen cleaners that the soft matte screens require.I do have a couple of small quibbles that didn't go away. I wish the trackpad had two buttons instead of one. It took Apple 15 years to finally decide to make a right clickable mouse and they should get on the ball and add a second button to their laptops. There is some two finger tap thing you can do with the trackpad but that isn't obvious or natural for me.My old iBook came with a RGB connector. The new MacBook doesn't, or any other video out connector. That's an add on that I had to spring for.I'm really liking the Leopard OS. I run OS X (Tiger), Windows XP and Gentoo Linux on other computers so am used to switching between operating systems. Each has strengths and weak spots but I find the new Leopard is the one that comes closest to just getting out of my way and letting me be productive.","Date":"March 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"Better Value than the Macbook Pro","Author":"Amazon3421","ReviewID":"R3CWPCBNJHERYS","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm a first-time mac user and have been very happy with this notebook. I thought 10 years of windows use would make the first month or so a hassle, but it was a surprisingly easy transition. Leopard is fast, easy to use, and has great features. The browser Firefox and Microsoft Word are the same, and bootcamp/parallels allow you to run Windows within Mac seamlessly if you need a windows program for some reason.Just one tip for people trying to decide between this or the considerably more expensive Macbook Pro- aside from the video card, the main difference is the screen size and the speakers. For this upgrade, you pay about double the price. I suspect they deliberately kept the Macbook screens stuck at 13\" to push people to go up a tier.By buying the Macbook, you can afford to get 2 extra gigabytes of ram to compensate for the videocard, a full-size, 22\" monitor, a decent 2-button mouse, and a mac external keyboard.At your desktop, hook up the mouse and the keyboard to the macbook and make the larger monitor your primary one, and you have an excellent desktop computer. If you have parallels, you can run windows on the macbook monitor, and OSX on the larger monitor, and switch between then effortlessly. When you leave work, just unplug the macbook from the keyboard and monitor, and boom, your powerful desktop just turned into a laptop. It's the best of both worlds.These extras more than compensate for the Macbook Pro's extras, And it'll still be cheaper for you to do it this way!","Date":"April 19, 2008"}

It's just a great computer. I have been a Windows sufferer all my life and I am terribly glad I decided to take the plunge. The OSX interface is just much friendlier and intuitive than any Windows could ever be.The keyboard takes a little time to get used to, but I was happily typing away normally in no time at all. And the glossy screen? Don't believe what others tell you; the colors are vibrant and beautiful. I am not at all bothered by the glossy screen. I got more than five hours of time out of the battery, and this is more than even Apple's estimate. The form factor on this laptop is very nice. It is a head turner for sure although the design is not exactly new or innovative.So if you're debating whether to buy the MacBook, I would give this computer a glowing reccomendation. This thing makes my HP look absolutely junky in comparison.If you're debating whether to jump the Windows ship, I say do so immediately.","Date":"March 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"Best laptop I've ever owned","Author":"deliot","ReviewID":"R1WKMJ9VYE5SZJ","Overall":"good","Content":"What is there to say?  The last Mac I owned was in 1989, it was an Apple II+ (I kid you not).  Since then, it's been PC after PC for me, until now.  In March 2008, I needed a new laptop, and I purchased the Black MacBook.  So far, I am a seriously happy camper.  A few tweaks to make sure I could use my favorite Windows programs (ie also installing Windows XP via VMware Fusion) and I'm very content.PROS:* Mac OS X is intuitive, user friendly, and easy to understand.  I am a big fan, and I've only had this laptop for 3 months.  The more I use it, the more I like it.* The screen is stunningly beautiful.  It is the clearest, brightest, easiest screen to read I've ever had.  Set it next to any PC laptop, and there is no comparison.* The \"MagSafe\" magnetic power connector is perfect.  I've never knocked the MacBook off of a table, even though I've pulled the cord out many times.*  I didn't have to leave behind my killer Windows XP programs!  I installed VMware Fusion, and now boot Windows XP right from within Mac OS X.  Very VERY nice and handy.  My only suggestion is to bump the RAM to 4GB before installing VMware Fusion.  Works stunningly well.*  Battery life (and power management) are stunningly good.  I get a legit 3-4 hours of battery life out of this laptop, compared to 1-2 hours out of all of my old PC laptops.* User friendly software built in such as iMovie.  My wife needed a DVD created for work.  An hour later, I had a DVD with menu system, her photos, music, etc.  Everybody loved it.*  User friendly System Preferences and settings in the Apple menu.  Much better than Start --> Settings --> Control Panel in Windows.  Just a better design and more user friendly access to settings.*  GEEKY:  The fan does not vent on the bottom!  So your legs aren't blocking it and feeling warm fan air.  Instead the fan vents up the front of the screen.  Very VERY smart, and I rarely hear it running.*  GEEKY:  Programs install as one .app file.  Sure there are settings hiding in various places, but Mac programs usually involve one BIG .app file.*  GEEKY:  Better flash drive integration.  This is similar to Linux (and obviously UNIX), drives are mounted and dismounted.  No two or three clicks to \"safely remove hardware\" like in Windows.  You just \"eject\" a flash drive (or CD or other drive) and remove it... as it should be.*  GEEKY:  Encrypted disk images.  You can use built in software to create password protected \"Disk Images\".  These can easily be mounted and unmounted, protecting sensitive files.*  GEEKY:  Terminal, Automator, the Dock, and Finder.  Well made robust tools that allow my \"inner geek\" to customize and do whatever they want.CONS:* No card reader built in?  This is a VERY stupid idea on Apple's part.  Almost every PC laptop now comes with a built in card reader.  MacBooks should also.* Only two USB slots.  Would be nice to have 3 or 4.  Not the end of the world, but could be improved.* Cost.  Mac people always tell me about TCO \"Total Cost Of Ownership\" and the like when justifying the higher cost.  Fact is, the MacBook DOES cost more.  Don't let anybody tell you it doesn't.  But the more I use it, the more I think the extra cost is worth it and the less the cost bothers me.  \"You get what you pay for\" is what obviously comes to mind.  For lack of a better term, it's an elegant machine.* That's about it.  Seriously, there aren't really any other major problems with this laptop.ON THE FENCE:* The keyboard is (at first) very different coming from a PC background.  I have since grown to love it, but it is an acquired taste.  Now that I'm used to it, I am impressed with how easy text \"flows\" and how much less effort I need to press keys.  However, white letters on black keys is tough in lower light conditions sometimes.Overall, the MacBook is what a laptop computer really should be.  Little details individually don't mean much, but when many subtle touches are added together with a powerful stable user-oriented clean UNIX based operating system like OS X, the result is the best laptop I've ever had.I will be sticking with Macs for a long time to come I think.","Date":"June 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"From A Clunker (MS) To A Maserati (Mac)","Author":"J. Aubrey","ReviewID":"RD5FAZNXCGHZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was a Windows user for 15 years.  Although interested in a Mac, compatibility with the Windows network at my office made me hesitate.  I'm now retired and since my ThinkPad was getting on (and acting up), I went with the MacBook.I was surprised at the marked superiority of the Mac right out of the box.  By \"superior\" I mean in all material respects--both hardware and software.  I realize some IT types, gamers and others may see some advantages to Windows, but I see none for a user like me (primarily internet, email, iTunes, word processing and photos).  It was a revelation to find a computer so stable and user friendly.  Other adjectives that come to mind:  Solid, Fast, Fun, Pretty, Snappy, Sleek.  From frustration to the sublime.I could go on describing the improved design, but let me give just one, seemingly trivial but representative, example.  I don't like trackpads, so I use a mouse.  In Windows several steps were needed to disable the trackpad and enable the mouse.  On a couple of occasions I forgot the mouse and had to enable the trackpad using keystrokes.  Frustrating and time consuming.  I ordered a wireless mighty mouse with the MacBook and enabled it in 30 seconds.  While searching Help to disable the trackpad, I noticed it was already disabled.  Then I realized it was automatically disabled when the mouse was added.  Then I learned  it was automatically enabled when the mouse was turned off or moved away from the computer.  Such a simple solution, but apparently lost on the Windows engineers.Finally--the operating system and compatibility.  The Mac OS is different from Windows and takes some getting used to.  But not as much as I expected due to the intuitive nature of the Mac, the actually helpful Help menu and the hundreds of very well done tutorials on the Apple web site.  As to compatibility, the Office for Mac suite does the trick, but know there is a different interface for Word, Excel and Power Point, so there is a learning curve for editing.  But I had no problem opening and editing documents,spreadsheets and presentations in Office Mac and sending them back to Windows, and vice versa.In short, my apprehensions about making the switch proved groundless, while being treated to a distinct upgrade in product.  Go ahead and do it.  You'll be glad you did.","Date":"August 7, 2008"}

{"Title":"A great first or second Mac (also does Windows)","Author":"M","ReviewID":"R123X0P4JO45KC","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm a PC/Mac Technician/Administrator by trade. So I have plenty or experience with Windows and Macs. I've used PCs since there were PCs and I always say I'll use the best tool for the job, and time after time the best tool is a Mac. Whether you're an aspiring programmer, designer, artist, musician or simply just want to surf the web, view e-mail, IM friends or and get your job done easily, a Mac will suit your needs.I bought this model refurbished off the Apple Store. Anything I say about the computer's Operating System (OS X) usually applies equally to other Macintosh models.First the Hardware:For a consumer machine it's surprisingly solid and the weight feels good. The built in camera (standard on Mac laptops and iMacs) is pretty decent as far as web cams go. After months of heavy use the hinges are still snug and the screen is just as bright. 2GB will take care of most people's needs.Also, and this is very important, since this is an Intel based machine you can install windows (or run Parallels, Fusion or Crossover) if you have one or two legacy Apps that you absolutely can't do without. A PC can't run OS X or any of its great applications, but a Mac can run Windows right along side Mac OS program with Parallels, VMWare Fusion or Crossover.So, if you're trying to decide between a Mac for OS X and the easy of use I talk about below and a PC for old Windows programs, you can choose both by buying this or any Intel based Mac (which is all shipping models).The Hardware is simply top notch. In its stock configuration you can do anything 99% of computer users do. And with a third party app, you can do the last 1%. OS X is Unix. Then you have the Mac OS (OS X) and you have he option of running Windows. So, really Macs these days are THE machine IT professionals are turning to in droves.The Software (is what makes Macs shine):OS X is extremely stable. It is a Unix OS, so advanced users can easily do anything from a command line they can do on any Unix system from a command line using the terminal application. If you don't understand the previous sentence you don't have to because the user interface as easy or easier than Windows and you never have to learn complex commands to unleash the power of the system.The only time I reboot is when I install software that requires a reboot. (Currently My Uptime is over 21 days -- since I installed an OS Update, and I have no doubt the system could remain on for months without needing a reboot). That's almost unheard of in Windows land, where often the machine chokes on some process and the only option is a reboot.You can't mess up the system by clicking the wrong button, or putting the wrong file in the trash -- OS X doesn't allow that and requires an administrator password to change any important settings.Adding Users is as simple as clicking a new account button, typing in their name and a password. Then you can switch users with a click and be secure in the knowledge that your kids or grandma can't mess up the system or your settings (because they'll have their own set), or applications.The system is very secure out of the box, and configuring to server web pages is a simple click and drag documents into a folder and flip the Sharing panel switch on. There's a built in Firewall that's extreme easy to configure. Wireless performance is top notch. There is zero downside to buying this machine.Installing Applications is often a simple process of clicking and dragging the application into any folder or subfolder you want. Uninstalling is a simple matter of dragging thhe program, or program folder into the trash. No messy registry, no dicey uninstall apps that might delete a shared DLL, nothing like that at all.Adding Other hardware to the machine is also a simple process of double clicking an installer (if it's even needed) and plugging in he hardware. You never experience hardware conflicts like you do in Windows. You just plug it in and it works.If you've never used a computer or want to migrate from Windows or another Operating System, a Macintosh is an excellent choice. I've never had a person I recommended a Mac to come back and say, \"This was a mistake, \" or \"I hate it\" or \"I can't figure out how to use it.\" They usually thank me and gleefully tell me they never realized using (and even administrating) a computer could be so easy.Mac VS. PC (Real world stories):I HAVE had many, many people come back to me after purchasing a Windows only Machine against my advice months or years later regretting it. They didn't realize a Windows based computer would be so much work, or that it wouldn't be reliable.Windows XP is a bear to manage and Vista is the same bear, but just in a shiny coat with a bow. And all you can get on new computers these days is Vista. And I have yet to run into anyone, technician or layman, who even likes Vista. Sure you can downgrade to XP, but you have ot make sure there's XP drivers available for your system before you downgrade it, because if not, you'll end up with Audio or Wireless not working, and have to put Vista back on. A friend went through this exact experience.There are some quality PC makers out there, but most are junk. If you're wondering why the MacBook costs hundreds of dollars more than a PC, remember, you get what you pay for. The margins Apple makes for a Mac are comparable to what PC manufacturers make nowadays. So, realize that most PC manufacturers are using cheaper (read \"low quality\") parts, and they're going to fail a lot sooner than a typical Mac would.Viruses and Security:Windows is way behind the Mac when it comes to security and virus prevention. Microsoft's solution was to pop up a dialog box for anything and everything a virus might do to try to gain control of a Windows PC. The effect: annoying the hell out of users. The OS X way: run in a mode where only things such as installing applications will bother the user. That and only check the first time if someone wants to run a new application. Once that's done the OS gets out of your way and let's you get your work done. Also, if this sounds too open, you can tighten down security simply by checking boxes in most cases. If you want to secure your machine's network connections even more try Lil Snitch.Caveats:Almost all computers will have problems. The Mac is no exception. You might get a lemon, but apple's return policy is great. With Applecare you're covered for the practical usable life of the computer (3 years).  A hard rive might die on you: that's where backing up comes in. Backup your data. The more important, the more often you should backup. Other than that most Mac problems are simple and might just require a setting change or (at worst) a reinstall of the application. With Windows you might have to reinstall the OS and each and every application. For software and hardware problems Apple's tech support is top notch. If something needs ot be replaced -- like a bad LCD (which is rarer and rarer these days), you'll often have the machine back in a few days if you choose to ship it in for repair. Just get Applecare with your system and you'll be set.The Bottom Line:Macs are far superior to PCs. Take it from a guy who makes money off of repairing computers. If this is to be your first computer, you probably couldn't make a better choice. If you're a Windows user considering a sea change, you couldn't pick a better time to do it -- especially considering that with a third party App you can still run Windows apps if you want to. And believe me you won't want to after experiencing the level of usability of the standard OS X application. And if you're one of those RARE Mac users considering saving money, and thinks computers are all the same: save your sanity and not just a couple of bucks, and turn away from Sony, Dell or HP.","Date":"September 25, 2008"}

It is very easy for me to suffer buyers remorse over a major purchase. Many times items don't live up to my expectations. With this purchase my expectations were exceeded. This computer is fantastic and the Leopard OS is awesome. It truly worked right out of the box and has all the simplicity of a plug and play device.  I have the white, 2.4Ghz, 2GB, 160Hd mac. The screen is beautiful, bright, crisp and colorful. The keyboard is just that with handy function keys that jump to the things I need.

Granted my schools computers I used we're Apple II's in the 80's and even the Mac 128k's in the 90's. But I've always been a Windows user building my own PC's and maxing out graphics cards and what have you. Been in the IT/IS industry since 2001.The thing is I'd come home from fixing computer problems to a computer/s with random problems. Maybe Windows didn't recognize the drivers to my graphics card for some reason and I had to reinstall it. Or a laptop that I downgraded from Vista to XP (Really though, downgrade?) suddenly starts overheating (only after sleep mode starts) because the manufacturer made software (not hardware) control the fan and the software only runs on Vista. Finally I had enough, I just wanted something that works.So almost shamefully/embarrassingly I bought an iMac. How dare I? I could build a computer for the same price with X times more performance! But after I started using it I realized I could stop worrying about that stuff and just start using the computer. Like Obi'wan says to Luke \"Just let go\" Mac's are a whole new world. The idea of make it easy to use spreads over to people who make the software for it, not just Apple software but third party's. Yes you can do everything on a Mac now. And sure you may have to install Windows to play your favorite games. But I've spent so much of my time seeing and fixing all the wonderfully awful problems that Windows spews out that it's nice to have a liberating experience on a computer that just works. Plugging in things like cameras or printers for the first time nothing happens. No window pop's up asking you to configure anything they're ready to go.I don't find myself having to go into a registry and change some variables because a toolbar disapeared. Or finding out that Creative doesn't fully support Vista for the sound card I bought dispite the box saying it does.I'm familiar with Linux and the OS is based on BSD/Unix. So your getting the shell, and you can run apache and php on it. With sooooo much less configuration then you would be looking to do with a windows box. And the thing about the spec's is your getting an OS tied into the hardware so much that performance is great. Windows has to account for a lot of different hardware configurations so sacrifices are made.And no your not buying a lifestyle your buying something that just works so you can get to work. You don't have to use these at starbucks drinking a latte and talking about your Jetta or how you voted for Obama. And you aren't going to become a pretentious snob.I haven't even mention the hardware of this particular Macbook. But things like a magnetically closing lid means there are no moving parts to break. Same with the power supply which is connected magnetically. It doesn't scorch my manhood from overheating. And it's very quite. I haven't heard the fan or harddrive kick on into overdrive at all like most laptops.Funny thing is I understand I probably sound like a snob talking about Mac's but in a lot of important ways they are better then PC's. When are PC's going to stop becoming things that get in the way of life? Maybe Windows 7 will fix all of your problems and make computing easier, if you don't think so come to the dark side and get a Mac.","Date":"November 28, 2008"}

The mac is not a pc, and you need to know that if you have never had one before there is a learning curve.  It just does  not do things like you are used to , and it does take some getting used to.A week after I had received mine, and after going through what seemed to be the thousandth tutorial, I remarked to my wife that I had really screwed up, and I should have stayed with a pc.  Now, some weeks later, I have learned to really appreciate the mac for what it is, a quick, trouble free tool to be used and enjoyed.  I am able to do what I want so much easier than with a pc, and I really like it.Close the lid, and it hybernates immediately.  Open it and it is operational within 5 seconds and that includes being on line.When I have to use one of the pc's in the house, I am constantly reminded of how much I love the mac.  The delays in operations that I had just learned to live with are now a source of aggravation that I am no longer willing to put up with.  I just avoid the pc's on my network if at all possible, and use the mac.There are still some software offerings that are not available for the mac or I would throw out every pc in the house.Buy the mac and you will love it!!I cannot wait for the other computers in the house to need replacing, and ;I will guarantee that the new products will all be Mac.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}

(I read a few articles about LED backlighting and it differs from the old CCFL screens, you can read more about that here [...] ). And it has an Intel 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo processor with 4 megabytes L3 cache, 160GB 5400RPM SATA (low-noise) disk, 2.27kg weight, 5 hours-long battery and Airport Wireless card that supports 802.11n technology with awesome reception accuracy and iSight camera.The most astonishing thing for now is the Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard 64bit, AWESOME operating system, and I can really understand now why apple always said that it's the most advanced operating system in the world, they are right, it's. :) it's a very well designed for a great user experience and you'll see many snapshots in the next few posts and well. it has more than 300 new features over the previous version \"Tiger 10.4' and the main thing you'll notice about mac is that it's a REAL FAST.The great news is that most of the well known and famous applications I needed are available for mac, like microsoft office and it's open source clone open office, adobe creative suite 3, yahoo messenger, MSN messenger and iChat works as an awesome jabber chat client.The first thing I'm so happy about is that I chose The white model. That's because the surface is very finger-print catching and can be easily scratched, but happily the white color hides most of it.Also, it's really fast.I use it mostly for music, internet, pictures, movies, homework pretty much what everybody uses a computer for. Also, I use it for my research, extensive statistics work and various medical work, and it works greatiLife is awesome and so is leopard (find out at apple.com)like when you turn on your pc it has load and load and load then when the desktop finally pops up then if you click on something it takes like 1/2 an hour to open upon this laptop it loads and and when the desktop shows you click something and it actually opens like its supposed toI have been using pcs all my life and i just got fed up with them.It is very nice computer to use especially during presentations (Apple Keynote is Awesome, especially, its presenter mode).Spotlight is very effective tool for searching for papers. Also, there are limitless possibilities and solutions for scientific purposes.Finally,Advantages:1- Very Fast.2- Reliable computer.3- Can run windows and mac osx applications (I use VMWare as a virtual machine).4- Lots of tools for your research (example ofr nice software for research: Sente, Papers, Endnote, Yep, ...etc).5- Stylish.6- Perfect Screen.7- Good Battery Life.8- Durable (I dropped it twice).9- Nice for chatting and communication (It's isight integration is flawless).10- Perfect software and hardware integration.Disadvantages:1- Needs more RAM (At least 2 GB Ram).2- Speakers are not so strong.Finally,It is a perfect laptop for a graduate student for the price.","Date":"July 6, 2008"}

Definitely recommend it and the speed has not slowed down enough to be noticeable. I think all computers start lagging as they age. However, my Mac is faster than all my friends' new (2012 or 2013) non-Macs. I purchased it for $1499 in 2008 and it has been through a lot. I replaced the battery once and it's had a new screen (my car was jealous, so it smashed it). I now have a crack in the screen frame, but nothing has been affected negatively within the machine itself. The downside of having an older computer is that software and hardware are not up to date with the latest versions because Apple clearly wants me to buy a new computer. Obviously I'm dealing with it the best that I can. This was an excellent first computer choice for me and it met my expectations of being a good investment. My next investment will be, of course, the MacBook Pro. I would not trade my Mac for any other computer and Apple does the best job in the industry. I only need another MacBook like this one so I can get updated on software, hardware and security features that run on the newest operating systems which I do not have.

So, let me just speak to my best personal observations and leave all the tech speak to others.I've been a life long Apple / Mac user. The first computer I ever touched was an Apple / Mac, but I can't tell you the model number. All I remember is that large, rainbow colored Apple logo! LOL Anyway, I always preferred Macs to PC's--even though I was often required to use PC's at work. At home, the computer was alway Mac!Just recently, I was shopping for a new laptop; I wanted a small, flexible, but powerful system that was easy to take and easy to use. I was actually tempted--the shame of it--by a good deal on a fine looking Sony Vaio. I compared it to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. I mulled over the decision for a week, and I had the opportunity to look at a new laptop with Vista, the flowered-faced monster operating system that everyone at work seems to be complaining about as everyone receives their upgrades in turn. To make a long story short, good \"Mac\" sense finally kicked in, and I eliminated the Viao from my potential purchase list. [I might have to work with Vista at the office, but I don't have to live with it, even if it comes in a pretty package! LOL] I then had to decide between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. AND at the end of the day, the deal breaker came down to choice: MacBook gave a choice between Black and White. [The MacBook Pro looks rather silver.] Well, I've had beige Macs and white Macs and Graphite colored Macs. I never had a Black one. So, the black one with its generous keyboard and large trackpad appealed to me.With hand on my heart, I can say that this is the best Mac I've ever had the opportunity to operate; it is the best Mac that I have ever personally owned. The software that I chose to get for this new computer was IWork 08 because I read good things about it--if you don't want or need all of Microsoft Office's bulk and sulk. I also purchased Internet Security Barrier Back-up Edition and StoryMill. Oh --if you love Widgets, you can download extra ones from Apple's official website.As with any big purchase, though, do research before you make decisions. Decide what you want the computer for and how you will mostly use it. The best computer for you is the one that you will use with contentment and productivity.","Date":"July 1, 2008"}

{"Title":"All Doubts Blown Away","Author":"Rufus Firefly","ReviewID":"R234RWDX9X2J97","Overall":"good","Content":"What a remarkable little machine this is.Let me start off by saying that I did my due diligence on this product. I read every review I could get my hands on. I trawled forums, review centres and video sites.And, probably like many of you reading this review, I had some major doubts: would it smudge too much? Are the edges really that sharp? Would the 13.3\" screen be too small? Would the transition from PC to Mac be a steep learning curve?I am delighted to report that all my doubts were blown away within the first 24 hours.Yep, it smudges. When you first pull it out of the box you'll have an immediate kinship with all those who complained about it. But really, I couldn't care less about it. I don't actually have to look at the smudges as I work on the Macbook, and they are easily wiped away with a cloth if you are fashion-conscious. It is worth noting that it is a fair price to pay for a very robust, leathery, sexy-looking shell.I cannot complain regarding the so-called \"sharp edges\". I'm a man with fairly long reach, I spend hours upon hours writing on my Macbook, and I have not had a single problem with my wrists.My greatest worry was over the screen size. I have always used 15.4\" screens with my laptops, and I was quite terrified that I'd find the 13.3\" screen too small. I was wrong. Profoundly wrong. I actually enjoy this size much better than my old 15.4\" laptops, which now feel big and heavy and cumbersome in comparison.What you will notice immediately is that the keyboard and trackpad are very big and inviting, and the screen is so crisp and clear that you feel right at home. And although the Macbook IS heavier than you would think, I ultimately find that its smaller size is much, much better all-round.And the PC to Mac conversion could not have been easier.I booted it up and it was ready to go. I spent hours playing with all the new toys at my disposal, and I have to say I never knew that computing could be this much fun. I know that there is a lot of hoo-ha over a Macbook's price in comparison to cheaper PCs, but what you quickly realise is that you are really paying the extra for the software...and for a few hundred dollars extra, you are getting a bargain.Examples. Photo Booth is an enormous amount of fun. The in-built webcam (with a very decent resolution) focuses on your face and gives you a 3-2-1 countdown before snapping with a flash. Before you take the photo you can easily select different styles you want the photo taken in, such as sepia, black and white, or even a kind of Warhol-ic mesh of colours. Just great fun, especially for families and couples, or individuals looking to track their daily weight loss as a visual record!You can also use the webcam to make short films of yourself (what you choose to do with that is entirely up to you!) and, of course, for having vis-a-vis chats on a whole multitude of instant messaging clients (including the excellent in-built iChat feature, which is easy to set up with any AOL or Google Talk account).It has a wonderful dictionary that looks up words in a fraction of a millisecond, It has a little tool that enables you to take snapshots of portions of your desktop (or the entire desktop). And then the iLife suite is just superb. Never has it been easier to publish a really professional looking website, or to quickly edit a movie, or put together a lovely photo album. I'm not a music junkie, but Garage Band is universally accepted as being brilliant for budding musicians.Then there is the Finder tool at the top right of the screen. Just type in a few letters and BINGO, you can instantly find anything you want to, whether it's an application or a document. Magic!Trust me, I am just skimming the surface when it comes to Mac's software suite. Heck, even I am still discovering new tools every day. It truly is a wonderful machine, giving you a really premium experience without any requirement of technical expertise. Compare that to your average PC laptop which comes bundled with a bunch of third-rate software that you never, ever use. The Macbook, in sharp contrast, practically seduces you into trying out all of its cool features.Oh, and this thing is FAST. Blazing fast. I can run a gazillion programs and it handles it with ease. To date I have suffered no heat on the Macbook, and noise is a thing of the past (this thing is like a ninja in slippers).And with the ability to run Windows software if I absolutely have to thanks to the Boot Camp feature, I cannot think of a single reason to dislike this puppy.I think that's what they call a \"rave\". Congratulations, Apple! Now I FINALLY understand the hype.","Date":"December 27, 2008"}
{"Title":"I'll never use a PC again","Author":"Gillian10","ReviewID":"R379Z66TZ5LUR4","Overall":"good","Content":"To summarize this product, the MacBook is an amazing laptop. My previous laptop, a Dell, caused me problems the first month I purchased it. It was terribly slow, had a battery life no longer than an hour and a half at most, and often would freeze up while I was using it. After having it only one year, the battery was shot and the computer wouldn't even run unless it was plugged in at all times. Eventually it blacked out and never turned on again.After all this, the MacBook makes my life so much easier since it runs extremely fast and isn't able to get the viruses that plagued my PC. The programs it comes with are easy to use and have more features than Windows programs. For example, iPhoto will automatically take your imported digital pictures and separate them into different events based on the time they were taken. This saves a lot of time when uploading photos because you don't have to manually select pictures to separate into an album. iChat is a smoother, more professional version of AOL Instant Messenger. Also, the built-in webcam takes surprisingly detailed photos that can be easily edited with the Photo Booth.The MacBook is a sturdy, dependable computer and is well worth the extra couple hundred bucks since it will save you a lot of the hassle PCs come with.  If you need to check something quickly, you can have the computer turned on and the internet running just a few seconds after pushing the power button. It is able to handle multiple programs running at once without slowing down or freezing.Many people are afraid to purchase a MacBook because they are unfamiliar with it and believe the programs are difficult to run. This isn't true at all, since I've found that the advanced design of Macs is much more simple to navigate then Windows. My dad has the same computer I do and feels the same way. I am always telling my friends to make the switch and get a MacBook.","Date":"November 25, 2008"}

The first thing I realized I loved about it was the startup time. My previous PCs took up to 5-7 minutes to completely start. This computer does everything virtually instantly. I thought the transition from windows would be difficult, but it wasn't at all. The entire system is extremely easy to use. It just takes getting used to. Everything from the address book, calendar, to mail feature is easier to use than the PC versions. I can sync my calendar and to do lists to my iPod quickly and easily. That is a great feature for being as active as I am. The only thing that took serious getting used to was the Microsoft Office applications. The layout is very different. And figuring it all out took some time. The note taking ability of Word is very different though. I like it better. It can actually look like you're writing on notebook paper and flag certain areas of the notes that are important. If that is too much for you to get used to, Macs can also run windows, so it wouldn't be a problem. Another feature that fits my lifestyle perfectly is the options with photos. With my old PC I felt like I was always uploading new software with every digital camera to make it possible to upload pictures and then other software for editing pictures. It got confusing. With the Macbook, as soon as I plugged my digital camera in it starting working. I could upload pictures, edit them, and they were never saved to an area of my computer that was hard to locate later. Everything is easier on a Mac and works in the most logical way. I love it and won't ever use anything else.","Date":"November 14, 2008"}

As for the macbook, this machine does just as much work as my iMac; only the screen is smaller. The display is excellent, sound quality good but not on par with larger systems. Keyboard will take getting used to as it is not the old IBM electric feel. The track pad will remind long time mac users of the old one button mouse and the control/click function.OS X has been a rock steady operating system for me since February, 2003, each new release making routine chores easier, along with more and better eye candy if you are into that.Software included is easy to use, you get real DVD backups, and no crapware. Documentation is better than most, but still \"lacking\". Get one of the Missing Manual books (Amazon.com has them)as it makes things much easier. All in all, 5 stars for the macbook and 6 stars for Amazon.com for the great savings. My next iMac will come from Amazon.com.June 2009 update:Have not had to reboot or reinstall the software since I bought this macbook. Get about 4 hours use before battery needs to be recharged.

When it was time to get a new one (not because my iBook was gone, but because I wanted a DVD burner and a faster computer) I chose the Macbook.  I opted to go with the 160 Gig HD, but I maxed out the RAM.All I can say about this computer is WOW.  I'm as happy, or happier than I was with my iBook.I have used PC's all my life, until I got my iBook, and in fact, still use them at work, and my husband still won't give his up.  But I get frustrated, upset and it always seems to me that to get from point \"A\" to point \"B\" on a PC, you have to go around the block three times, to get to the same place you can on a Mac by going next door.  It's that easy.This computer is snappy.  It boots up, and down really fast.  I like the hard plastic case, it's very durable.  One of the things I really like about my new MacBook is the two finger scroll on the track pad.  It took me a few weeks to get used to it, but it's so natural now, and I really love this feature.The magnetic cord is very cool, we will see how long it lasts, since the one thing I did have to replace twice on my iBook was the power cord.  Wireless connectivity has been wonderful,and not only do I pick up my signal, I pick up all my neighbors as well and I live out in the country.  The battery on it seems to last about 4 to 5 hours.I've already done some tuning up to make it run even faster than it already did.I'm finding I am really enjoying the shiny screen.OSX is such a nice system to learn to use, if you are new to Mac's, it won't take you long to get up to speed.I never considered getting the Macbook Pro or Air because of the sort of computing I do, but both have their great qualities, but don't discount this little computer either, it's a well made machine that makes computing fun, not frustrating!","Date":"June 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"White Macbook, the best all round computer","Author":"Barry David Stocker","ReviewID":"R27Q1ZGHHQ3QEG","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first notebook and my first Mac.  I have checked other notebooks and nothing really compares.  It's beautiful in appearance, the operating system,  Mac OS X Leopard, is an enormous pleasure to use, and I am not missing Windows, though I could run Windows on it.  I've been using it as a substitute for my old desktop PC as well as a  portable and its great in every role.  With a usb hub it can do everything I want from a desktop and fast.  As a portable it's light and compact and very easy to carry around.  I certainly think it's the best Mac for most people as an all round computer, other Mac models do some things better but this does everything well and certainly the basic computing functions, editing documents and browsing, playing music, work beautifully.  I've played DVDs on long bus journeys and it's great for that.  Since Macs are a better experience than PCs I think this is the best computer around.  I strongly recommend using Mac with the native Safari browser, a beautiful and fast browser, perfectly integrated into its environment.  I also strongly recommend iWork, which has to be paid for after free 30 day trial.  (http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MA790Z-A-iWork-08/dp/B000BQXTSS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=software&qid;=1211785700&sr;=8-1) I was so impressed so quickly I upgraded on the first day of the trial.  It's far far better than MS Office, and no one with a Mac really needs the Office for Mac package which is more expensive than iWork.  Possibly for some very specialised business purposes Offices still has advantages over iWork, but as an all round word processing/presentation/spread sheet package it's a beautiful experience which does everything I need quickly (and I'm  heavy user of word processing and related utilities) and and like most things Mac its both simple, no clutter, and stylish.  It fits perfectly into the Mac OS environment, making it even more of a pleasure.  The free  text editing software in the Mac opens Word documents, and the Pages wordprocessing has the option of saving documents to a word format, so very few people need Office on their Mac.  Don't bother unless you are really sure you do need it.","Date":"May 26, 2008"}

I have been a windows user all my life, not necessarily by choice but because I didn't really know what else was out there. After reading all the great reviews for the macbook and checking them out in the local store I decided to dive in. I am pleasantly surprised at all of the features and especially with the overall efficiency of the machine. I am up and running in less than 60 seconds no matter what program I choose to run. The only drawback is there is an adjustment period if you've never used a mac before but its worth it to press on through the learning curve.

I worked with the IT dept/their website so I got one of them.  all I can say was that this mac was my best computer experience - ever.  Well, a MacBook pro I guess would be better, but anyways...Pros:-Amazing battery life, I usually got like 4 hours somehow-Really powerful, every app was very snappy, even if I had a ton of apps open-It's an apple (woot)-The screen looks REALLY good.  I had the glossy one, and it was like HD happiness every time I watched a movie-Keyboard feels really good-Mouse has great feedback, but not annoyingly sensitive (like when you're typing and bump it, it doesn't send the mouse flying opening Photoshop when you're trying to work on a something else and not in the mood to force quit photoshop before i got the activation screen of adobe death (I had a 30 day trial and forgot to delete it)-webcam / skype happiness-Mac OS X is really really really easy to understand.  I was a Windows junkie before I used a mac and i learned how to use a mac in seriously a day or 2, it's really intuitive.Cons-the underside can get kind of hot if you're doing processor-intensive activities, but that's true with basically all laptops unless you have a cooling mat/fan under itThe screen isn't great for outdoors, but neither is any other glossy screen.It might be a good idea to get a spare power adapter, because although the magsafe power adapters are really genius, what tends to happen  is the wire inside the sleeve gets untwisted, so you you get like twisting bumps on the wire... if that makes sense.  This isn't a real big deal but it could lead to a kink/break of the wire if you're not smart.  Plus, this didn't happen to me, but some reviews say on the Apple site that the wire can fry through a power surge?","Date":"April 16, 2009"}

White MacBook back in July, and I can say that I've never in my life been so impressed by a product. It's simply fantastic. What drew me in were the looks, but this computer is so much more than that. The Mac OS is years ahead of anything else. Things like expose and spaces make using this computer very easy. The iLife software that's included is all that the average user will ever need to manage a digital lifestyle. The iSight camera can be loads of fun when using Photo Booth, and very convenient for video chatting. When people say that \"everything just works\" on a Mac they're not lying. In 6 months I haven't had a single problem. Apple's integration of both software and hardware is unmatched by any computer company out there. If you're not sure about this computer, or any other Apple computer I highly recommend that you give it a try. You won't regret it.","Date":"November 15, 2008"}
{"Title":"THE PERFECT LAPTOP!","Author":"Shawn A. Dildine \"Shawn Dildine\"","ReviewID":"R2DJ34FNG7KZ36","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple never ceases to amaze me with the products that they put out. Every time I turn around they have a brand now version/model of a laptop or desktop that is simply amazing. I know that when I purchase an apple I am buying something that is made with quality that I can trust. The Macbook is by far the best laptop that I have ever purchased. I made 2 other purchases towards laptops before getting my Mac, and yes they were PC laptops. Something always went wrong with one of the PCs and after a while I was tired and just wanted something that worked. I never really gave the Macbook a second thought after messing with one in the Apple Store.Macbooks seem to have everything I need, and some. As a student it is very important to have a computer that I can trust to not crash on me while I am typing up a 20-page document for one of my research classes. It's also important for me to know that I can take my laptop to class and not be worried about the loss of too much battery. The Macbook's battery life is very impressive compared to my other laptops I have owned. I can get at least 3 hours of battery life off of the charger. IT'S AMAZING!!!  I am also into graphic designing, and with the Macbook's fast processor and AMAZING Adobe Photoshop CS3 software, I can makeup something that some can only dream of. The Macbook's pristine 13.3-inch glossy screen display makes all of my graphics, along with movies and other visual items, to pop out of the screen.If you are in the field of searching for a new laptop, I strongly encourage you to check out the Macbook, it will be a worthwhile purchase!","Date":"November 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Best computer I ever owned....","Author":"Scott Jason Hervieux","ReviewID":"R35J8T2ZNQM33K","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a macbook in April (bigger hard drive than the ones listed here 250 gb), and I also have Parallels and Windows XP on it.  Now after using windows for 20 years, I figured there would be a learning curve.  I was very surprised how easy this computer is to use.  Somethings I had to learn, but for the most part I took it out of the box and I was up and running.After 5 months of use, I never had a problem with my system.  I have over 5,000 photos, about 1,000 videos, 5,000 songs, and a bunch of other software for work/school/church ministry (30,000 or more documents).  With the mac apps I have switched to, I find that they are more stable and more intuitive than MS Windows based apps.I recommend this computer very highly.  In fact, because of the quality and stability - I bought my wife a mac mini (she did not want a laptop).Buy this computer and you will be very pleased.  You can do anything that MS can do, and better with the right native mac OS X apps.  and if it is not on a mac, well.... you can still run Windows on this computer in bootcamp or a virtual machine like VMFUSION or PARALLELS...Everyone I know that has tried a mac, or has seen mine, now wants one.As for those posts about a mac crashing - ok maybe 1 or 2 in a manufactoring run may have a defect (but that is the nature in electronics in general); but everyone I know who has switched to a mac never has had a problem.  I do suggest the Applecare warrenty, just in case.  But unlike other laptops - this is the first one that something did not break, nor have I had to reformat  the hard drive after a few months....  5 months of everyday use for 4-5 hrs or more and still running like the day I took delivery on it.With mac os x, I  found I did not need all the software I had - as a lot is built into the operating system and iLife that comes with the computer.Time machine backups is great.  It makes an exact copy of the hard drive, then copies of every files.  I could just unplug the external hard drive and plug it into another computer (PC or MAC) and browse right to the file - unlike other backup software that requires special disks and mounting the drive.also, I bought a Wacom Bamboo tablet and plugged it in.  recognized it with no problems.  Turned on the inkwell and handwriting recognition in the preferences for OS X, and now I have a tablet-like PC.  while I cannot write directly on the screen, this is the next best thing.Switching from windows to this was a breeze.Update 4/2/2011 - After 3 years of heavy use, this laptop never failed on me once.  Never had to re-install anything, unlike window where I would have to re-install at least twice by now.  Due to all my native OSX apps, I deleted Parallels.  I no longer need Windows for anything, unless I am working on an MS SQL Server project.  I must say, out of all the laptops and desktops I have eve owned since the 1980's - this has been the most reliable.  I have since grown to needing 1.5 tb of space due to all my music, photos, video, documents, etc.  I imagine I can get another 2+ years out of this, as it still runs as if it was just pulled out of the box.  I rarely torn this machine off.  The only time it is rebooted is when a software update requires it or I need to take it somewhere (less so now that I own an iPad).  Otherwise, this machine stays turned on 24X7.  I also heavily render videos on it.  Considering upgrading it to 4gb ram, due to newer video software being resource intensive.  Not a problem for the CPU, more so that my complex videos are running down the ram.Again, this is the best computer I ever bought.  I have used it for work also, when my Work Windows Dell was down.  That Dell went through 2 hard drives motherboard and power supply.  They gave me a new one with raid, and it crashed both raid drives in a year.  I was really surprised how this laptop out performed a quad core 4gb Dell GPX 750.  Was so happy, I bought my wife a mini in 2008 and that never crashed either.Happy owner of 2 macs, and iPad, and 2 iphones.  Never going back to Windows again, unless my employer requires it.","Date":"September 20, 2008"}

Luckily, I know the client, but it got downright funny. Without the power cord attached, it kept going into hibernation and took forever to get out of that mode. My new MacBook just pops opened and starts working w/o any problems at all. I can leave it on for days and days and open the lid and it's ready. After using both Macs and PCs since the late 80's, I can't say enough good about the Mac and in general, all of the Apple products. Don't get me wrong, I've owned several Sony Vaios and they were all fine, but this one really made me miss my new MacBook for my presentation.

A lot of people complain about macs being too expensive, but if you know anything about apple, they target a specific market who can afford to pay for their premium computers.  if you complain that they cost too much, its usually a windows person who are used to paying $500 for a crappy laptop that eventually craps out or is overrun with viruses to a point where nothing works anymore.  Another thing that people don't realize is macs retain their value VERY well.  I sold my powerbook g4 1ghz titanium for $550 in oct 2007 which originally cost $3k in 11/02(i bought it used for $500 in 12/05).  It was still in great condition with no problems when i sold it... it was as fast as my old p4 2.53ghz desktop which has been gathering dust for a while now(i had been a windows user for nearly a decade).This is my current setup:Black Macbook 2.16ghz/3gb ram/160gb hd/superdrive w/ OSX 10.5.5westinghouse 24\" LCD monitor @ 1920x1200fantom drive 250gb firewire external hdwestern digital passport 320gb usb external hdpinnacle hdtv stick for mac(hdtv tuner)logitech wireless keyboard & mouseAs you can see i have my macbook plugged in with a lot of accessories and i run 7+ programs at once when im using my mac, including eyetv(hdtv), isight cam w/ sightspeed video conferencing, as well as other less intensive applications.  If you want a great dependable and quick mac this is the one to get, especially now that you can find it at discounted prices since the new macbooks came out.  The only con that I have is that my old mac has the old 950GMA integrated graphics which can be an issue if you like to play/edit/encode high res videos or play graphic intensive games, especially full hd 1920P.  I can play 1920P videos fine but it will get bogged down if im using a lot of other cpu intensive programs.  im sure this won't be an issue for the majority of users since those people would probably get the macbook pro instead.  i have had no issues at all that people have complained about(fans, cracked plastic, screen flicker, etc) and im sure i'll use this mac for another 2-3years before upgrading again.pros:fast, lightweight, long battery lifecons:slow graphics chip","Date":"October 23, 2008"}

{"Title":"the best as always","Author":"jmann","ReviewID":"R3P4OV3K1YYXQR","Overall":"good","Content":"i absolutely love pretty much everything made by Apple,especially their laptops. i really wanted  either a new 15 inch MBP or a 13 MBA, but didn't have $1500. so as i do with everything i buy, i researched it excessively, and figured it would be great for pretty much everything. i got it, and it was advertised as in \"good\" condition, well the whole front of the keyboard/trackpad assembly was cracked, which is very common on these non-uniboby MacBooks. what somewhat angered me was that it looks like someone tried to fill in the cracks with super glue, and if i were to replace the assembly, it would not sit flush. but thats ok, since i ended up getting it for just the cost of shipping anyway, since it arrived so late, the seller (totally on their own, btw) gave me a full refund and didnt want it back. so now onto the actual device, it does all i want it to do and more! it plays 1080p video (which i was very surprised about since it has a non-HD intel GMA), it even plays call of duty!(the older ones) i upgraded the hard drive to a 7200 rpm 160GB, i was thinking about getting an ssd, but realized that i still need windows for school(i go to a technical high school, i take CADD, and all the programs that we use are windows-specific), so i am going to order this also, ASUS 1215N-PU27-SL 12.1-Inch Netbook (Silver) and take the hdd out of that, put it in this, and put an ssd in the asus. (yes, now i realize i am spending close to $1500, but not really, since i got a refund on this. once i get the asus, this will still be my primary laptop, i just need something to take to school since the computers in CADD suck","Date":"February 13, 2012"}

They pack everything you need into a tidy little package. If you have the money to spend, I would definitely pay more ($[...] more) to get the newer style unibody Aluminum Macbook, because the screen is better and I personally prefer the aluminum casing because I'm always on the go, and I travel so much. I have a friend with a 2 or 3 year old plastic Macbook, and his laptop has plastic cracks on the edges, and little tiny slivers of plastic broke off of his computer. This being said, I opted for the aluminum version, with the nicer screeen.However, the plastic Macbook was great for my mom. She basically only uses the internet (Safari/Firefox), MS Word, and MS Excel. I've also been encouraging her to use the Apple Addressbook and iCal to manage her contacts and calendar/schedule. She loved the fact that she could find and download all her fav old music on iTunes, but even though I set her account up, I doubt she uses it at all because she probably doesnt know how.We got her signed up for One on One at the Apple store, so she can be more proficient in getting up to speed with the Macbook. Even this plastic thing has way more functionality than what she needs, it's great.I'd definitely recommend one of these plastic Macbooks for an entry level computer, or light computer user. However, if you have an extra $[...] to spend, try to get an aluminum unibody macbook. It's built better and has a better screen.","Date":"February 19, 2009"}

{"Title":"Am I A PC Or A Mac?","Author":"Caleb Williams","ReviewID":"R20P2JIR9NHQZM","Overall":"good","Content":"Well up to the point at which I bought my first Mac, I was definitely a PC but now I know what I've been missing. Apple have been on the rise over the past few years thanks to their wonderful invention of the iPod. There's no doubting that the mass media attention surrounding Apple thanks to the iPod has lead to an increase in sales of the Mac. Honestly, that's the reason I decided to get a Mac when my last Windows laptop broke and I've not looked back.Aesthetically, the Macs are just gorgeous to look at both on the outside and in the operating system software. That is Apples biggest selling point, make it simple and make it pretty. Pretty it is, but at first simple it is not. Having been a user of Windows software since I've been able to use a computer, getting used to the Max operating system created a learning curve which I couldn't be bothered with at the time. It really is so easy that I felt like a pro using it within about half an hour.Thanks to the 2GB Ram of my laptop the transission between programs is almost flawless and because I generally don't do that much on my computers anyway, just word processing and the likes, I have noticed almost no lag in the running of the programs. The laptop itself is light, sturdy and just very durable as it has been knocked about a bit.Battery life is around 4 hours on low power mode which is very, very impressive as I generally need to use this to do work outside the home without the absence of an electrical output. Because the AC adaptor of my model connects magnetically, I have to say that it's a very very cool feature but worry about how long it will last before the magnet decides not to attach itself to my laptop.It does come in a few different colours, (Black, Silver, White) and silver would get the recommendation from me as it just seems fitting and better looking overall. The processor works perfectly and as mentioned before there is pretty much no lag in switching between programs. Virus possibilities are almost non-existent as it's very rare that virus's are made to attack Mac software so there's no need for virus detection software.There is little to no need to update your Mac software as it's top of the range when you buy it and genuinely ahead of the market. The load and shut down times are almost half of any Windows PC making that even more appealing as if you need to get to your work quickly, you can. It doesn't generate any large amount of heat from the processor so you can place the laptop in sleep mode and leave it overnight without the worry of overheating.If you want to look cool in Starbucks then you should buy one of these, and if you want to do your work with little difficulty, then you should buy it. Hell, just buy the damn thing.","Date":"March 5, 2009"}

It does everything I need to do, and every day I learn something else about it! Without having to buy any other software, I can make audio productions, video and even green screen.

You have to buy spreadsheet  and word processing and stuff like that if you're used to them, but they do have options. It's really light weight and the only down side is that the keyboard is too simple. I'm not that savvy, but the key board is not the same as my old IMAC laptop.

When using dual displays, it is very annoying because the menu bar is only on one screen, so I have to move the cursor to the screen with menu bar to select menu items, it is a pain.3. the dock can be very cluttered when multiple windows are opened, unlike Windows, it does not group same type windows.","Date":"February 19, 2009"}

{"Title":"MacBook for Traveling","Author":"Rodney D","ReviewID":"RB5PL3YLS02YQ","Overall":"good","Content":"After experiencing Mac's in college and having multiple PC's at home I decided to turn to the Macbook to replace my older PC-based laptops for travel.  I HATED being on the road missing a driver or disc or network adapter and just wanted something that worked well, focus on Internet connectivity, playing DVD's & some games to while away the travel hours.This macbook definitely does the trick!Like other reviewers mentioned, I did not find the 13\" screen to be inadequate when watching movies (once engrossed in a movie you don't notice it) and in fact preferred the smaller size when traveling.  Internet works flawlessly -- easily connecting to \"whatever hotspot is out there\".My only complaint has to do with the fragile power adapter.  I haven't broken mine YET but just read up on it and you'll see the VAST majority of people who've complained about it.  I'm now afraid it will break when traveling.Perhaps you're thinking, \"No big deal I'll pick up a 3rd party adapter\" -- wrong.  Apple for some idiotic reason has placed a patent on its poorly designed power adapter and made it super expensive -- as in $70 expensive!  So in a nut shell they are forcing you to spend $70 for a faulty piece of equipment every few months while increasing the fustration/worry factor -- very very poor move.Instead, I found a 3rd party supplier in China through eBay and ordered one from them with a 3 year warranty.Its only the power adapter worries that had me rate this 4-stars.  Once Apple fixes this all should be well.Although I LOVE Amazon.com and purchase from them regularly, I have to say I got this through MacConnection for under $1000.","Date":"February 12, 2009"}

It's small, but powerful & Apple combines software that seems great for it, but you have to buy work utilities.  I've the trial version of iWorks 09, though my I'm having trouble with it & my nonsoftwared mentality.  Apple stores schedule free classes for us less computer-literate types.  The unbreakable magnetic cord reminds me of my old Compac Presario laptop falling with the plug in & put out of commission by a broken jack.  The white finish is easy to clean, strong, & won't dent or conduct heat - it does grab her mascara flakes, but they come of with cleaning wipes & this is supposed to be hers anyhow.  This is the 2.4Ghz, 2GB unit that some later ones don't even have (economics, I guess; they're 2.0 & 2.1 Ghz).  I think it's much handier than the larger versions.

{"Title":"Awesome computer","Author":"Hercinovic Omer","ReviewID":"R21HLMOM6OABSB","Overall":"good","Content":"I had a really hard time deciding between the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. After a few weeks of deliberation I had finally made my decision and went with the MacBook (Black, 2.4Ghz) version. As you may have noticed I also didn't go with the new macbook, I prefer the previous generation MacBook's more for three reasons: Price, firewire and screen.I'm really satisfied with this product and I'm glad I didn't go with the more expensive MacBook Pro, this computer exceeds my needs and I really like the smaller size for excellent for portability. The battery life has also been exceptionally great, when listening to music on iTunes and browsing the web with maybe a few other applications I get around 5 hours of battery life. And now the bad: when I first received the computer the trackpad button was pretty much jammed and really non responsive, I was pretty bummed, I took it to the Apple store and the \"Genius\" cleaned it up a bit with some pads and it seemed to do the trick, when I came home I took a closer look and found what looked to be like small pieces of glue on the upper right corner of the trackpad button, I carefully removed the pieces and now it works perfectly. This was odd to me but I really don't care at this point, I'm just glad it works. To wrap things up, I have no buyers remorse and therefore love this computer and recommend it to anyone out there in the market of buying a new computer.","Date":"January 29, 2009"}

{"Title":"From PC to Mac - It took 20 years.","Author":"M. Russo \"mitchrusso\"","ReviewID":"R3ALL0ODOL0Y9U","Overall":"good","Content":"I thought I would start like others who shared their experiences here; Converting to a Mac after two decades of PC usage was something I would never have intended to do, right now, right here and without abandon, but I did.  I had to actually, while at a conference my 15 month old Sony Viao dies, completely dead.  Yup, it's the mother board, $500 to fix, and wait a second.  Out of warantee? Completely.  This has been one of the slowest notebooks I have ever owned and after this experience, I would never buy another Sony anyway so I looked around the conference and 1/2 the people in the room were using MacBooks.  Besides, the battery life is less than 2 hours. Wait a second, Apple only has 8% market penetration. Ha!  Not so in my world, it's more like 50%. So, like contemplating going to France, I thought about a Mac. What wild and spicy experiences wait for me inside that shiny silver slab of aluminum?  Getting curious?On a borrowed Aspire One net book (wow, what a piece of garbage) I started searching for my software apps on Mac.  Everything I needed was there, including my trading platform; Think or Swim, even my Pulse LiveScribe was now supported with a native Mac app.So which one to buy? Prices seem a little steep here.  Thinking thoughts like: \"Proprietary hardware and software = gauging customers\" and \"Why buy this when a Dell for a grand is as powerful and I don't have to relearn how to think\" but in the end I made a decision.I chose the MacBook 13\" with the 2.4 ghz processor. I bought it from Apple's refurb link on the web site. I was was sent there by the dude in the Apple store. He told me it's identical to new and comes with the same warantee. He was right; feels new, acts new, can't tell the difference.Then I surfed Other World Computing's web site and spent about a hundred more and bought 4 gig of ram and a 7200 hd.  So now my machine is ready for what normally would be considered heavy usage.  While I waited for my upgrades to arrive, I started using the computer. It's fast, no doubt, but it's smoother than I expected. Everything flows seamlessly, a lot of care has been taken to make things easier than expected.While I have a 4 gig Windows desktop (actually 32 bit Windows only lets you access 3.25 gig) I know how that gets bogged down when I have all my apps and windows open so I thought 4 gig would be essential.  I read that all Macs can natively access 6 gig of ram, an excellent fact to tuck away for those days of photoshop and lightroom while on airplanes. I went for a bigger hard drive (320 gig) but at a higher speed; 7200 rpm.  After all, it's an extra hundred. If you priced that on the Apple site you would need to sell relatives to get those upgrades.  So for $1299 and an extra hundred, I have a macbook that rivals my desktop.But wait a minute, I don't have all those upgrades installed right away, I still use the machine in it's humbled state; paltry 2 gig ram and pokey 5400 rpm drive.  I can read email, thinking I will bide my time until the UPS driver crosses the Mississippi and make it out my way, and like Woah!  This sucker is fast.  And it's running everything at once. Apps just pop open.I start to check out GarageBand and promptly make an appointment at the Apple store for one of their free classes, I take my 14 year old daughter. It's love at 1st site. She's a singer, formally trained and up and coming. (I know, I am Dad.)  And I am watching this training class - totally blown away - watching her eyes sparkle and I realize this would accelerate her move to a professional recording environment, allow her to make demo's, learn how to mix and sequence music, while using their lessons to improve piano and guitar. And this software is free with the computer.  I realized that I had to get her one.  Yeah, it's another grand, but this is not a toy or a gizmo (uh, well... maybe it is fun and cool) but more of a tool for advancing her abilities and skills.Now, I start to dig around some more into the \"free stuff\" that comes with a Mac. There's a photo editing program (iPhoto), a movie maker (iMovie), a continuous backup system (Time Machine), mail client, contact tracker and other \"features\" to make life easier.It's now 4 hours on one charge, the battery life is at least double that of my sony.  * I am hooked * Now, I have this laptop that flies through space and I have this 3 monitor setup on my desk with a PC (lead anchor) as it's engine.  Its all too depressing.  Why is Apple about to take most of my money, why, why?  I'll tell you why, because this is what using a computer is about.So now that I am done raving about this new experience, I should sober you up a little and let you know some of the cold hard facts that might help you decide which mac is good for you.First; the 13\" MacBook with 2.4 ghz processor is nice but the 2.0 processor is probably fine for most things for most people.  If you are graphics intensive, the Pro is a better fit. It's $500 more so you gotta need it to spend that money.Missing: Why doesn't a mac book have a built-in card reader? Photographers will miss this. What about a real video-out jack? Apple seems bent of getting an extra $30 to connect an external monitor.Deficient: The screen can't go black.  While it's not that important and may not be noticed by most, photographers and videographers will notice.  Seems like a real problem that can only be solved by getting the pro version.Uncomfortable: The sharp edges on the Aluminum frame are tough on my hands while leaning my palms on it to use the touch pad.Awkward: Showing up at meetings where everyone else is still using pc's.Onward: Enjoying computing like I did 20 years ago. What do you think, should I ditch my Treo/Verizon and go to an iPhone on AT&T;, where the service is said to be lacking?","Date":"April 23, 2009"}
{"Title":"Only one nitpick - Video chipset","Author":"Raven A. Wind","ReviewID":"R16D8OOXMZJFCW","Overall":"good","Content":"Everyone else has said it- The MacBook is a fine piece of equipment. I love mine. I use it on the go, and as my desktop unit at home once I connect to a 24\" monitor and surround sound system.  I've had mine for about a year now, and it's been great. Solid performance, easy to upgrade, and of course, awesome with OS X.My only complaint is that they could have done better with the video chipset. I don't expect to run major 3D games, but I would like something that doesn't share system RAM. The Intel GMA is great for HD video (outputs quite nicely at 1080p) and everything you'd need in the GUI. What it lacks is in pushing major graphics, like advanced photoshop or video editing, and yes, in later-release games.With games, I just use my PS3, but for other things-- particularly virtualizing Windows- the shared RAM is a problem, and does slow things down when I'm doing too much at once.If gaming and major video work isn't your need, then the MacBook is the best laptop on the market. As a bonus, it comes with Apple's great customer service.I don't know about paying extra for black, though. . .","Date":"October 23, 2008"}

My wife has had a G5 for the past 4 years with no problems, while I have been through at least 3 Windows machines and AV programs so it was just inevitable that I would make the move.

Download Skype, have free video conferences with the built-in camera without even rebooting.3. iPhoto: I've moved 15,000 photos from various places to this mac. iPhoto makes it easy to browse, print, etc.4. GarageBand: My 10-year-old daughter figured out how to make slideshows with music. The photos from iPhoto automatically show up as source material. Magical.5. TimeMachine: Automatic backup. Zero effort, 100% protected.6. Spore: Thoroughly addictive game. Runs fine on this machine (1GB memory).7. Watch television. It's finally happened: TV is really available on the internet now (hulu.com). This laptop is wide screen, so you can watch HD content easily.8. Quicken: Checkbook done right.9. Wireless networking: I almost forgot to mention that it took only 2 minutes out of the box to get the wireless working.

Fortunately, Apple will quickly replace those parts for FREE and out of warranty if you take it in for repairs. I can count on ONE HAND the number of times this computer has frozen, crashed or needed to be forcefully restarted, and none of the hardware has failed. Oh, one time it slowed to a crawl ... because I hadn't turned it off or restarted it in nearly six months.After 4 years of hard daily use, we're still going strong (with a brand new upper case, a new battery, and an added 2GB of RAM), and I expect this baby to last for at least another year!

{"Title":"Buy Alienware's!","Author":"Jesse D. Brown \"JDB\"","ReviewID":"R21KQLRRSDN9UE","Overall":"good","Content":"These are all odd statements, I myself have owned several Alienware's, as well as a couple of my friends have some as well, and none of us seem to be having any of the problems that you people are having...What people have to realize is that it is not Alienware that is the problem, it is computers in general, all computers (including Mac's...) have plenty of issues... the difference is, the price tag, people automatically assume that just because an item has the highest end components as well as the biggest price tag that the thing will never have issues... well that is a very false assumption.  I have friends who have HP's, Dell's, Mac's, etc... all of which have problems with them, but because they were just junk to begin with and cost next to nothing, they just go out and buy a new one.The simple fact is, hard drives do fail, Alienware DOES NOT make hard drives, graphics cards fail, Alienware does not make graphics cards, CPU's fail, once again Alienware DOES NOT make CPU's, all, all of these companies do is take parts that have already been made by other companies and put them together for you. The big difference between Alienware and the rest is they basically only use the highest end parts made by companies such as nVIDIA, Intel, Samsung, Seagate, etc... as well as place them into a flashy case. So it is understandable that they place a higher price tag on them. Plus Alienware's whether your experience with them was good or not, certainly have higher standards than any other computer maker I have seen. When you look inside a HP, Dell, etc.. the wires are all just thrown in where ever they fit, components are tossed together as quickly as possible, where with Alienware the wires are tucked away nice and neat, and each computer is made to order (hence the amount of time it takes to actually recieve it, it isn't already in a box it still has to be made!)The claims of poor support, I do agree with, but now that Alienware is owned by Dell (acquired in 2006) support is better, (better support started around Sep of 2009) rather than sending in systems for repair, they come to your home to fix them for you, but still expect to be on the phone for an hour or so if you want to get anything accomplished.But when it comes right down to it, I myself personally own three (3) Alienware's currently and have had others in the past, the only one I ever had any real trouble with was the Area-51 m15x due to the plastic casing cracking around the hinges to the LCD display. I now have the new M15x, the M11x, and an older Alienware 750i Desktop, all of which run as good as the day I got them, and all exceeded my expectations. A friend of mine has the m9750 and loves it, has never had any issue with it, and another friend of mine has the new Area-51 ALX which runs AMAZINGLY and works perfectly.","Date":"September 27, 2010"}

{"Title":"Simply amazing","Author":"B. Mayes","ReviewID":"R3JFCO7TN38OFM","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a wonderful notebook.  The attention to detail is amazing, for example, the keyboard automatically illuminates itself in dimly lit areas.  The single button mouse and trackpad can double as a two button mouse:  place 2 fingers on the trackpad and click the button and it's a right-click.  Place 2 fingers down and slide them up or down scrolls the page.It has been good for running games.  I have the 128MB video card in mine and seems to handle C&C; Generals and Half-Life2 with ease (via my boot camp partition running Windows).  I have even run C&C; Generals via a virtual machine, and it was certainly playable (though I had to turn some of the settings down to medium instead of high).  I haven't tried any other games at this point.  No doubt the 256MB model should handle things even better.Installing Windows via boot camp is a snap, and then installing some virtual machine software allows you have to Windows whenever you need it.  Run it side by side with OS X, or reboot into Windows natively.The worst part about this notebook is battery power.  With everything turned on and the screen brightness on high, the battery will only last 1.5, maybe 2 hours.  This isn't good for using on plane rides longer that that.  However, I was able to watch 2 movies in a row (approximately 4 hours) and still have some life left.  I accomplished this by ripping the movies to my hard drive (doing so saves power since it doesn't have to spin a DVD in the drive constantly during playback), disabling the wireless card, and lowering the brightness as low as possible.  Unfortunately I can't seem to control screen brightness when booting directly to Windows, so the battery life is much worse when running Windows.Apple just released a battery update in early October 2007.  It appears the battery life is better (I can now get about 3.5 hours with the brightness at about 50-60% when simply checking email, browsing the web etc.).  I'm very pleased with that update!There is very little learning curve if this is your first time using a Mac.  It's rock solid (in fact, the only application that seems to crash on me is MS Office), and rarely requires software updates (unlike Windows).  Though not many viruses affect Macs, some still do and there is anti-virus software available for Macs.If you're considering this but not sure, just take the plunge.  You won't be disappointed.","Date":"October 6, 2007"}

It seems well made, is  powerful and most importantly OS X is a much better thought out OS than Vista and generally better supported than Linux.  It has a few shortcomings such as just 2 USB ports, and it gets too hot due to the metal frame. I could live with these but I have struggled fruitlessly to get decent wifi internet speeds.  (My friend's Thinkpad is 10 times as fast to download and render pages on my wifi system side by side.  Ive spent ages searching the web for the solution and found loads of people have similar problems (Just Google for \"macbook pro slow wifi connection\" if you don't believe me.  There doesnt seem to be one  single problem and people have come up with a range of solutions.  Some people  say its WEP keys  that are the problem, other that its something to do with the N wifi card. I do get geat speeds if i take it to the Apple store and use their non encrypted Wifi connection. Probably I could eventually get it to work, but I want this laptop to travel around the world with so i cant afford to take  kiyt thats going to take 6 hours of headaches to get cproperly working each time I get to a place.The other  issue is working within a mixed Mac/Windows enironment.  Boot  camp and parallels are very helpful, but I still have encountrred annoying issues  eg that it doesnt like NTFS formatted disks, that it tries to format Ipods wit MAc  filing system so that they cannot be used on PCs  without special downloads.Bottom line its  a lot of hassle.

However, as with every brand new product introduced it had a lot of problems. I waited and waited till this last update in June 2007. It seemed like Apple sorted out the issues and Tiger is now mature so i took the plunge.I bought mine directly from Apple since i qualify for the education discount. I must say that it has the absolute best screen i have ever seen on a computer. It is so bright that i can't view it at more than 75% brightness. The glossy screen shows vivid colors and is a pleasure to view.Mac OS X itself is an amazing OS. Very easy to install and uninstall applications, you don't have to worry about Virus protection but i did enable the firewall. I had 0 problems syncing my phone with it using bluetooth. I had no problems connecting to my printer via our wireless home network. I even added some tweaks to get quicktime to play more types of movie files.

{"Title":"Fantastic product, but cannot say the same for customer service.","Author":"Yi Wei Wang","ReviewID":"RSXIHLDLXV25K","Overall":"good","Content":"The MBP is an absolutely wonderful product. It is fast, powerful and can even handle some mid range games you throw at it (provided you are using Boot Camp). I bought this with the intention of using Aperture 2 and Final Cut and it has served well to that purpose ever since I bought it. In that regard, this product should have received 4 stars.Now the reason why I gave it a 4. It is my belief that merchants such as Amazon should make the shopping and deliberating process of buying an expensive item such as a laptop as easy as possible. It was easy enough to find all of the MBPs offered by Amazon, but it became quite hard to distinguish between which model offered what and which model lacked a certain feature. I even called Amazon CSR to verify to see if this was indeed the model with multi-touch and was told that it was. Of course, upon receiving the product, I realized that it was not. Too lazy to deal with returns, nor did I think it was really necessary, I just forgot about it. But the important thing to take away is that the Amazon CSR basically read off the description page and knew almost nothing of what I was asking. It might be better if I had done some more research but I was pressed for time. I recommend anyone buying similar items (ie. different models of MBP) to do additional outside research or hope that Amazon will put up a comparison feature within their web page.But let me be clear, this product is near perfect. Buy it if you need it. You will not regret your purchase.","Date":"May 2, 2008"}

{"Title":"MACBOOK PRO DELIVERS IN ALMOST EVERY WAY","Author":"Workman","ReviewID":"R2VWEC6UBPOXK4","Overall":"good","Content":"I'll agree with every positive thing being said in the previous reviews.  I was a life long Windows user that switched to Mac.  I've used various Macs in the past and had become pretty familiar with OS X....but this is the first Apple I've personally owned.  Having said that....OS X is so powerful it makes the computing life so much easier.  I believe many PC users that \"hate\" Apple are more afraid of changing than actually having a reason to dislike Apple.Anyways...  My only complaint about the MBP is the screen resolution.  On the 15 inch version the resolution is a native 1440x900.  At first I was a bit put off by this--but considering how crisp and bright the LCD screen is I was willing to operate at the \"lower\" resolution.  I went from my previous laptop's resolution of 1280x1050 to 1440x900 and after a few days I'm pretty happy.  Still the question remains as to why Apple would limit you to this lower resolution.Everything else about the MBP is top notch.  At first I thought the aluminum casing would be to delicate for everyday use--but fortunately the casing seems to be bulletproof.  It doesn't seem to fingerprint or scratch easily at all.All in all you cannot go wrong with the MBR.  If you think, as I did, that the lower resolution would be a deterrent to taking the step into Apple's world--don't be.  At the very least go look at this beautiful LED driven screen and see what you're missing...or should I say not going to miss?","Date":"December 27, 2007"}

Well, don't. I can tell you this computer is worth it.  I was hesitant at first to make the purchase, wondering if I really needed it, but it is an investment that is and will continue to pay off, not just for college, but for life in general.  Computers, and especially laptops, are becoming cache's of personal life. What better way to trust our computing experience and organize our digital life, than to a good computer. You pay for what you get, and Mac's are the best.So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it's my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for. FYI, I'm a college student who used to be a Windows power user, and now that I use Mac, I don't have to worry about spyware and virus's anymore.  Such a relief.

Mac is my new favorite at school :) It's a lot smoother and simpler than Windows and the programs that are preinstalled (and FREE!) are amazing to say the least :) When ordering this product, the only \"built in\" option I'd say you absolutely NEED is the speed upgrade from \"5400 rpm\" to \"7200 rpm\". If money is not an issue for you, then of course I'd recommend buying ALL the options lol, but if you have a budget (like most of us)...REASON (for purchasing speed upgrade): As you gradually save more information/programs on your laptop (whether it's a Mac OR PC)... you will start to see a decrease in speed on your system. With the upgrade, as your computer slows down it will then eventually become as fast as it would've been in the first place WITHOUT the upgrade. Yes, you could always purchase the doubled memory (preinstalled is $700/separate is $500) OR you could save your specific files on USB memory drives! Maybe it's only because I'm a student... but I've discovered it's easier to save all my documents/pictures/videos/web history for each class on these drives (and it also develops my organization skills! lol). I have 6 classes and with 2GB USBs at $20 each that's only $120.By doing this, the only thing slowing down your computer will be programs you later install or download... and the decrease in your system's speed will occur 1/2 as quickly than if you'd been saving EVERYTHING on it.If you're interested in any other information I can give you about this (or any computer), email me at RachelLMayo@gmail.com :) I'd be more than happy to help!","Date":"September 11, 2007"}

It starts up in record time and is the most solid operating system I have used.Only a few minor negatives.  The light sensor for screen brightness is in a bad spot and the screen brightness levels can change constantly unless you have good lighting in the room.  And when it comes to battery charging, the laptop wont take a charge unless it drops below 94 or 93 %.  So I let it drop down below 90% in the morning before I plug it in.Overall if you need a muscular, powerful computer for design and editing I highly suggest purchasing one!","Date":"October 17, 2007"}

{"Title":"Excellent","Author":"Edubya in Texas","ReviewID":"R2P3GU1Z24I916","Overall":"good","Content":"First, a little background. Aside from a TI-99 we had when I was a kid and the Apple IIc computers at my middle school, I've always been a Windows guy. I feel very comfortable in the Windows environment and have been building my own PCs for about 15 years. I don't hate Microsoft. But when the need for another laptop became clear, I decided to focus my search on the higher end machines. I wanted good horsepower, but I especially wanted a nicer form factor than the creaky Dells I had become accustomed to. As I had fallen in love with the interface on my iPhone, I decided it was time to give MacBooks a try. I kept my Windows desktop in case I ran into compatibility problems.The short version of that story is that I quickly dismantled my PC and now use this laptop as my only machine. I am fortunate to be able to do so because my work as an attorney requires only Word, Excel, and an internet browser. As a bonus, my copy of Lightroom 3 also installed on the MacBook. I'm trying not to sound like a Mac zealot, so let's have a list:-Aluminum unibody is no marketing gimmick. It's sturdy and feels great with no flex and no creaking. Looks nice, too.-Keyboard is well-engineered. The key travel and spacing between keys feel just right for my taste. There is no flex here, either, which I often find disconcerting on other laptops.-Trackpad is a marvel. It really is. It's very large, but I've yet to feel like it's in the way. And the finger movements are intuitive and work very well.-The screen is bright, clear and has great color. The reflectivity is sometimes an issue in bright locations, but I find tilting it a little solves most problems. Otherwise, you can custom order the anti-glare screen direct from Apple.-The lid closes with a magnet, so there's nothing to break.-It is very fast. In my experience, Mac OS X starts up and shuts down far faster than a comparably spec'ed Windows machine. I have yet to feel a need for 8 GB of RAM, but an upgrade would only cost $90 if you know how to do it yourself. Otherwise, I have no issues running lots of standard programs at once.-Comes with Time Machine. As an attorney and amateur photographer, I have lots of stuff that needs to be backed up regularly and reliably. Time Machine works so well and so seamlessly that I can't imagine how I survived before.-Spotlight is brilliant. Type in any word, and Spotlight almost instantly gives you results from your entire hard drive, including INSIDE your searchable documents, preferences, web results, and even definitions of words.-Seven hours of battery life is very possible, even on wireless. I can sit in Starbucks for hours unplugged and still have plenty of life left. The caveat is that you really can only surf and use programs like Word. I also have Flash installed, which is a huge battery drainer, so I grabbed a Flash-blocking program that let's me choose which Flash files to activate. Nice solution.-HD webcam. Nice quality, though I haven't really done more than messed around with it.-The magnetic power cable is slick.-As a former Windows user, I find the Mac OS X interface to be really nice and intuitive. There's obviously a learning curve, though I've found it be surprisingly short. Lion is anticipated to be a nice upgrade, too.-PRICE! Well, a lot of people complain about the Apple premium, and it definitely exists. I found this laptop to be a few hundred dollars higher than the really nice Windows laptops with mostly similar specs, although I don't think comparing raw horsepower between two different operating systems is always an accurate benchmark. I live on my computer, so I'm willing to pay a little more to get what I want. It's like buying a BMW because you have to spend three or four hours a day in your car. Whether that value equation works for you or not is up to you and your checkbook.-Anything I dislike? Not really. I'd like maybe one more USB port and a CF card reader. I'd love to start seeing cheaper SSDs in these things, but that's really not Apple's fault. Decent SSDs with any size are still expensive for everyone. I was a little nervous about having a 5400 RPM HDD. I think transferring large NEF files from the card reader might be fractionally slower. The tradeoff in battery life is probably worth it. Will Thunderbolt be worth it? Who knows? I don't care just yet, but ask me next year.I know there's more to say, but I'm running out of steam. I'm happy to discuss anything in the comments.","Date":"March 8, 2011"}
{"Title":"Notebook New Era - Quad Core Processors","Author":"Steve H \"books911\"","ReviewID":"R1S5F35CLT2BVW","Overall":"good","Content":"The update to the 15-inch MacBook Pro in February 2011 was significant. Indeed, significant may be an understatement when it comes to the increase of processor performance offered by the updated machines. Quick thanks to Amazon and Apple Stores for having these immediately available at launch.The primary upgrade to this revision? The processor! Intel has a brand new architecture called Sandy Bridge, and these MacBook Pros are the first Macs to feature this technology. Some have called it some of the most significant changes to Intel architecture since Pentium 4 was introduced. These 15-inch MacBook Pros as well as its big brother, the 17-inch, not only take advantage of Sandy Bridge, but the Quad Core i7 Variant. Quad Core processor in a notebook Mac! Wow.I actually chose the 13-inch model for my personal use (only Dual Core on the 13-inch), but a 15-inch is replacing an aging iMac at the office to save space and leap over its performance. These Quad Core Chips are amazing. Early benchmarks are showing this entry-level 15-inch, 50 percent faster than the upper end i7 15-inch MacBook pro from a year ago. A dramatic improvement. This higher end model is even better.  Furthermore, if you're still on a Core 2 Duo machine such as the iMac I am replacing, the performance is as much as 2.5 times faster and 3x faster with this higher end model. At least in terms of the processor. This is most beneficial in processor intensive applications, for consumers such applications are iMovie and Garageband. Professionals will see the new processors beneficial in any professional photo editing, video, or music work.This model also includes a fantastic dedicated graphics card with 1GB of graphics memory.  1GB of graphics memory is a a first for Mac notebooks.One downside is that due to cost, the machine still comes with a spinning hard drive standard. In this case, the standard drive is a 5400 RPM 750 GB drive. That offers plenty of storage, but is slightly slower than a desktop 7200RPM drive and much slower than a new, solid state drive. You do have options. You can special order the machine from Apple with a 7200RPM drive, or Solid State Drive. However, what I have decided to do, is simply, when I'm ready, swap out the drive myself. Other World Computing sells solid state drives compatible. It might not be easy for every user, but for those with some computer experience, it is a fairly easy swap. Then I can install a faster solid state drive, when the more acceptable capacity drives come down a bit in price. You might also choose to do the swap yourself because you can then put the hard drive that was originally in the machine, into an external enclosure, and use it as an external drive for backup. Of course, any damage you cause to the machine would not be covered under warranty. Therefore, if you have any concern, you might want to see if you can special order from Apple online, or in many situations, you will find the standard hard drive to be acceptable.After the processor advancement, Thunderbolt is the other great new technology included in this revision to the MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt looks like the Mini Displayport that was already included on the MacBook Pros. Indeed, it will still function perfectly as a Mini Displayport, for connecting an external display. However, Thunderbolt is more importantly a new interface to connect external devices in the future, such as, external hard drives, HD camcorders, and perhaps even iPads, iPods, or iPhones someday. Data would then transfer many times faster to and from these devices than it does currently. These devices were not available at the time of the MacBook Pro's launch, but we have already heard that external drives should be available later this year with Thunderbolt connectivity.iSight camera has been upgraded to HD resolution and Face Time pre-installed on the computer. This gives you the ability to video chat, easily, with other Macs and notably, iPhone 4s and the newest iPod Touch with front facing camera.The consumer software you expect to be included by Apple is once again here. The latest version of Mac OS X Snow Leopard (operating system), iLIfe 11 including iPhoto, Garageband, iMovie, iDVD, and iWeb is all here. OS X always includes Safari web browser, iTunes, and Mail applications too. The average user would be good to go out of the box. You might pick up Microsoft Office for your office document needs, or simply purchase Apple's iWork applications (Pages, Numbers, and Keynote) from new Mac App Store on your computer.The new MacBooK Pros, thanks to Sandy Bridge technology are fast. They will save you time, when using processor intensive applications. Time in business, saves people money and frustration. The average consumer might see less gains with this update as physically the MacBook Pro has retained it identical appearance, size, and weight. Nevertheless, under the unibody, improvements have certainly occurred which result in a much faster notebook. The fact that these 15-inch and 17-inch models now include Quad Core Processors standard is really extraordinary. This is putting recent top of the line desktop performance, into a sleek and attractive Mac Notebook. A breakthrough. Recommended Product!","Date":"February 27, 2011"}
{"Title":"Simply the Best!","Author":"Robert Green","ReviewID":"R3ME90MJ0MLBFA","Overall":"good","Content":"Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch LaptopI have spent months reviewing different laptops. I've gone through at least 10 laptops in the last year looking for that one laptop that I will be pleased with and keep for more than a year or two. I've had Acer, HP, Compaq, Asus, Sony, Toshiba, and others. Sony was the only laptop that didn't go FUBAR within a year or so.So, I thought I would give Apple a shot and I was not disappointed. I first tried out a 17\" dual core that was super but the resolution was just too small for my eyes and I returned it. But I was so impressed with the quality of the case, the screen (albeit the resolution too small for my eyes), the quality of the innards (no cheap stuff under this hood), the quality of the power cord, the very fast 800 firewire, the backlight keyboard, the ease of typing on the keyboard, and the mouse pad. The mouse pad on this laptop was the first one I have not had to disable while typing. I have no idea why we have been stuck with those stupid PC mouse pads for so long when the solution was so easy! On the Apple laptop you push the pad down instead of tapping it. This means the cursor does not move to some abstract place and you find yourself typing three pages back!But, then Intel released their new Sandy chips. I figured that Apple would not use these chips for some time so I started looking at PCs again just for the new chip. I couldn't bring myself to buy a PC after owning a Apple. Fortunately Apple did release these new Macbook Pros with Intel's new chip with increased graphic memory and the new Thunderbolt. Plus Apple increased the speed of the memory.I just could not help myself and I purchased this MBP 15\" with the 2.2 i7 Sandy Bridge with the 1G memory. I am very glad I did. This laptop is fast. Its unibody case makes this the most solid and durable laptop on the market. The innards are easy to access to upgrade memory and the hard drive. Everything inside this machine is neatly arranged and is of top quality. The battery is rated for seven hours which is pretty accurate. The Mac OS is written to take advantage of the quad core chip, memory, etc. The LED screen is crisp and clear, and with the regular 1440X900 resolution I can easily use this laptop without any eyestrain.I only have one puzzling complaint about this new laptop. Why in the world would a company build one of the fastest top quality laptops in the world and stick a hard drive spinning at 5400 RPM? Yes it is a 750 gigabyte drive, which few people including myself could never fill. But running at 5400 RPM? I just cannot understand this.You can order the drive spinning at 7200 RPM or opt for a SSD on the Apple online store. The strange thing is that the 7200 RPM drive is the same price as the drive spinning at 5400 RPM. But that is not the point. Yes, most people will never notice the speed difference between a 5400 RPM and a 7200 RPM drive unless you are doing some pretty intensive media editing or are a avid game player. The point is why build a top of the line laptop and stick in a old busted down 5400 RPM hard drive like an afterthought. I fixed this discrepancy by installing a new Intel 160G SSD (solid state drive).I have been using laptops since 1991 when they made great paperweights when they died. This is the best laptop I have ever owned. Do yourself a favor and try one. Even if you don't like it you can always return it. I don't think you will, but you do have that option.","Date":"March 3, 2011"}
{"Title":"true desktop power, high-res screen, great battery life","Author":"Paul Christensen \"gadget geek\"","ReviewID":"R1LVR5FZLRZCCV","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been a power Mac user since its introduction in 1984, and have owned various portable and desktop configurations since then. Frequently, you will see major leaps in desktop performance, but it is rare to see dramatic improvements with laptops (you typically see 25-50% improvements). But I have to say, in all the Mac laptops I've owned since my very first PowerBook G4, this is the most dramatic leap in performance I've ever seen. Not only is it 2.8x FASTER than my mid-2009 2.66GHz Core2-Duo 15\" MacBook Pro, it is slightly faster than my 2008 2.8GHz dual-quad-core MacPro!I bought my 2011 MacBook Pro (2.3GHz quad-core i7, 15\" high-res screen) as an upgrade from my mid-2009 15\" unibody MacBook Pro.  I wasn't expecting to be LITERALLY blown away by the raw computing and graphics performance of this update. I have run every standard benchmark suite in comparison not only with my 2009 MBPro, but also against my 2008 dual 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Xeon \"Harpertown\" MacPro. And to my surprise, this little wonder beats BOTH machines in CPU and graphics performance. Imagine carrying a laptop with true desktop power. My real-world tests (iMovie, Aperture, Photoshop and Nikon Capture NX) simply validate the benchmark results.Here's what my tests reveal:- Geekbench: 10450 (vs. 3722 for 2009 MBPro vs. 9533 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 CPU: 5.56 (vs. 1.53 for 2009 MBPro vs. 5.76 for 2008 MacPro)- Cinebench 11 GPU: 36.38 (vs. 13.77 for 2009 MBPro/nVidia vs. 26.51 for 2008 MacPro/ATI 5770)Now THAT is impressive!Even though the Intel \"SandyBridge\" core i7 processor in this Mac is advertised as quad-core, each core supports 2 simultaneous threads (8 operations), which you can literally see when running Cinebench. If your computing needs don't support multiple cores, the i7 can bump the speed of a single core up to 3.4GHz (TurboBoost) as well.To truly match/replace your desktop environment, you'll need to replace the built-in hard drive with an SSD, because 2.5\" hard disks, even in 7200rpm configurations, are much slower than their 3.5\" desktop counterparts. I bought my SSD through OWC, and I'm seeing anywhere from 3-40x(!) faster performance for I/O intensive operations such as booting, working with VMWare/Parallels virtual machines, and processing large files (images, video, etc). It is simply the best investment you can make, if you can afford it.Beyond the raw power, there are a number of incremental improvements over the 2009 model:- integrated Intel 3000 graphics, and ATI Radeon 6750M (dedicated graphics with 1GB VRAM)- 1.33GHz memory backplane, supporting up to 16GB of RAM through third-party modules- new Thunderbolt interface using the Mini DisplayPort connector (super-fast 10Gbps interconnect for up to 6 devices, although no Thunderbolt devices are available yet)- Mini DisplayPort supports digital audio and video on a single cable (including HDMI with suitable third-party adapters)- higher-resolution FaceTime camera- SD slot now supports SDXC- updated optical drive (ingest mechanism is less finicky for me)- better battery lifeThe high-resolution screen in this model REALLY makes a difference over the standard screen (which I had on my 2009 model). The 1680x1050 resolution is the same as my older 21\" Apple Cinema Display. I was afraid the higher resolution would make it harder to read (the text is smaller), but the brightness and wide-angle visibility makes this one of the best displays you can get in a laptop form factor. If you work in heavily-lit or outdoor environments, you might want to consider the anti-glare (matte) screen which is available in Apple's build-to-order configurations. Both dual and mirrored display configurations are possible - simultaneously supporting full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an external display, both at millions of color. Interestingly, in my configuration, I was only able to get an external HDMI display to operate on the high-performance discrete GPU only.Another pleasant surprise for me was the battery life of this new 2011 model. Even with all that processing power, I'm consistently getting 6-7 hours of usable life (lightweight not heavy work). One big tip for saving battery life is to install the freeware gfxCardStatus utility, which lets you choose integrated only (much lower power), automatic, or discrete/ATI graphics. Apple's own Energy Saver system preference only lets you choose between automatic or discrete. And when you're running on the battery, this can be problematic because simply launching some programs (eg. PhotoShop) can force the discrete adapter. Like earlier designs, the battery is built into the unit and cannot be swapped or user-replaced. In practical use, I don't find this to be a problem because I'm getting the same extended runtime that I got on earlier MacBook Pros with 2 battery swaps.Rounding out the compliment of ports (on the left side only) is Gb ethernet, FireWire 800, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and audio in (both supporting analog and digital/TOSlink connectors). If there is any weakness, it would be nice to have a right-side USB port, or at least enough separation between the USB ports to not force you to use a short USB dongle cable with your 3G wireless card (if you want to use both ports).As with Apple's other MacBook Pros, this model is built on their \"unibody\" construction, where the main case is crafted from a single piece of aluminum. This makes the laptop amazingly rigid, and also allows it to be lighter weight, thinner, and better at dissipating heat than more traditional laptop designs. Apple makes it easy to upgrade the memory or hard drive (you just need a fine #00 phillips screwdriver to remove the screws on the bottom plate).One last note on this MacBook Pro - Apple bundles a special build of OS X 10.6.6 which you will want to immediately upgrade to 10.6.7 using Apple's Software Update mechanism. (You can't apply the 10.6.7 combo updater since this version of 10.6.6 is later than the standard build). The \"OS X 10.6.7 Update for Early 2011 MacBook Pro\" includes an important fix for the discrete graphics processor under heavy workloads.For those of you (like me) who still have older PowerPC software that hasn't been updated (Quicken!), this will most likely be the last generation of Apple notebooks to run on OS X 10.6.x \"Snow Leopard\". The next release of OS X 10.7 (\"Lion\") has removed support for running PowerPC applications (Rosetta). This alone was worth me upgrading to this model.","Date":"April 1, 2011"}
{"Title":"Great machine","Author":"Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","ReviewID":"R27W3GPZZ7YPUZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've used a pretty wide variety of both PCs and Macs, both for personal use and for work. I've used them for gaming, development, and run-of-the-mill tasks. However, my last two machines (three counting this one) were all Macs. I'm still a believer in the PC for hardcore desktop gaming, but as far as laptops go I'm pretty much sold on Apple. Why? Quite simply, Mac laptops are just a lot less fuss. They don't break down or exhibit weird quirks as often as PC notebooks, generally last longer on battery power, and take up less space. For my latest machine, I decided to splurge a bit and get something that can actually play games- fully intending to take advantage of Boot Camp to run the loads of Windows titles I usually play on my monster desktop gaming rig. The 15\" 2011 Pro with 1 GB video was the obvious choice: not so big I can't carry it around, yet with enough muscle to run anything in my library. Was it worth the huge price tag? In a word: yes.Pros:Case design is superior, not just elegant but functional as well. It's actually somewhat water resistant (don't ask) and very easy to clean. The form factor is slim and handy- easy to carry around.Hardware layout is well thought out, and design is excellent. Speakers are positioned so the sound is crisp, almost as if you had externals. Camera is sharp. Trackpad is huge and very responsive.Mac OS X is still the best OS out there. I must say, Windows 7 is a whole lot closer than any other previous incarnation of that franchise, but OS X still has it beat in many ways: no defragging, doesn't degrade over time (especially when used for software development), more stable, boots up and shuts down faster, and generally speaking more intuitive in UI layout. You'll also have a lot less to worry about as far as malware and spyware are concerned.Screen quality is great, and the backlighting for both the display and keyboard are excellent. Note: I strongly recommend paying the extra for the high-res 1680x1050 display upgrade, unless you're always going to have your machine hooked up to an external display. It is totally worth it. Second note: if you do get this upgrade, don't bother with the anti-glare, as it's equally totally NOT worth it (you can get a third party stick-on that does the same for a lot less, and is removable).Has enough power for pretty much anything. RAM/hard drive are easily upgradeable- buy it yourself and install it yourself; it's about as hard as loading VHS cassettes. This model straight out of the box can run most current games on max settings.Dual boot is easy to set up. I'm running Win 7 64 alongside Snow Leopard for gaming purposes. Boot camp sets up all the drivers with little fuss. The only issues I've seen are that the graphics card switching doesn't work on Windows, which eats up battery a lot faster, and right clicking with the trackpad is a bit awkward. The latter is easily solved by hooking up a 2-button mouse.Magsafe is awesome. I'd probably be out a few dozen machines from tripping over the cable if not for this simple yet brilliant feature.Battery life is great. It doesn't usually last for 7 hrs as advertised; 5 hrs is more typical when doing various tasks. However, even that is huge compared to most similarly specced laptops.For a laptop of this size with this power, it's really light.Apple's customer support is top-notch. If you're in the US their stores are pretty much everywhere, and you can get same-day repair service in most cases. Try doing that with Dell or HP sometime...Cons:The mini displayport/Thunderbolt connector means you'll need an adapter for pretty much every different video device you hook up. They're a bit awkward to hook up and can get bulky if you have enough of them.If you run 3-D intensive apps like most games the big video card turns on, and it runs pretty darn hot. When the fans kick in, it gets pretty loud.Compared to some older unibody platforms, it's harder to get at the innards. You have to unscrew the whole bottom plate and remove it to even access the battery. For most users, though, this shouldn't be too big a deal.It's considerably more expensive than a similarly specced Windows laptop.Doesn't have a blu-ray drive, if you care. Most Windows machines in this price range do.Is this machine for everyone? Probably not if due to the price alone, but I've found less to complain about than just about every other laptop I've owned. I'm still a fan of the regular MacBook for non-gaming/coding tasks due to its smaller form factor, lower cost, and lighter weight. However, it doesn't have the power to do anything more serious than video playback. If that's all you're going to do and ease of transport is a priority, then go for it. If you're planning on replacing a desktop or want some serious mobile power, then the Pro is a better choice.","Date":"May 30, 2011"}
{"Title":"MBP... where have you been all my life?","Author":"M. Canales \"Msc\"","ReviewID":"R2G2VZ99RUJZ9Q","Overall":"good","Content":"I can sum up my review in one word:Superb. No, Extraordinary! No, Awesome! No... well, you get the idea.Maybe i'm over reacting, but i do love this little machine. Its just over the top, the quad core processor breezes through anything i throw at it, and the 4Gb are very capable (though i'm considering upgrading it to 8gb soon). Something that really rules is the video card. So far i've installed several games on it, and ALL of them it runs on very high settings.This is my first Mac, so i had to suffer a slight adaptation period. A very slight period. It took me all 15 minutes to get used to it. It's just so natural!I love tweeking configs and personalizing my computers, and though Mac OS is more rigid with respect to the themes one can put up, its a marvel when it comes to comfort. If you get down and dirty, Exposé and Spaces will rock your world. And the dock is just so much more practical than the standard issue windows bar.Now, compatibility wise Mac OS can seem problematic, however this is just an illusion. This particular MBP packs so much punch that you can literally run windows on it simultaneously without even a hiccup. Virtualization, however, is a must for anyone that needs specialized software (specifically anyone with a CAD oriented program repertoire).Im running Parallels 6, with a Windows XP virtual machine, and it runs all my Engineering programs beautifully (Staad.pro, MathCAD, Civil 3D, Revit Structure, MS Project). There is a Mac version for AutoCAD, but if you already have the windows license, the virtual machine will run it beautifully too. With tools such as \"Coherence\" you can be using Windows and Mac simultaneously without having to deal with the typical Windows problems.Something i'm loving is the stability. Now, i have been pumping this baby with hard hitting processes since day 1, and it has responded well. Now, don't get me wrong, it did have its standard hangs on certain apps, however the hangs are very \"contained\", as the OS on a whole remained perfectly stable during these hangs. The apps that would hang, could easily be Force Quit and reopened with no data loss.I've been using video converters for a long time, since i do have preffered formats for video, and this little piece of heaven really cuts down conversion time. There is this little open source app called Handbrake that handles itself pretty well for conversion. Its one of the only apps that i've found that can handle the quad core resources almost seemlessly. Bootcamp is a must if you do heavy gaming. I installed Windows 7 on it and it runs like its native... Better even. I've installed games such as Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Deadspace 2, Starcraft 2, and Just Cause 2. They all run on full graphics without a zinch. I've been really pushing this machine, and so far im extremely satisfied.I've been reading other reviews, and i cant understand some of the complaints. Maybe they got bad units, but then again Apple will replace any defective unit in a flash so it's not really an issue. I dont have any complaints with respect to battery life, i can get the advertised 7 hours, and even push out 8hours if i bump out Airport whilst im using text processors. However when using resource hogs, the battery drains quickly (for instance when running XP simultaneously the battery life goes down to around 3-4 hours. Graphicly demanding programs also drain the battery quickly.If you are looking into this particular model (15\" 2.2Ghz Quad Core 4gb Ram 6750 AMD Radeon), then chances are you know your way around computers. My guess is you are probably into graphicly demanding progs as well. So i can vouch for it, and say that it has answered elegantly to any vulgar attempt i've made at maxing it out. If you are not looking for a powerhouse though, i STRONGLY recommend getting one of the mid ranged models.The price tag on this baby was the only cringe-factor... but now, 3 weeks into this enterprise, i can say its definitely worth it. If you can afford it, and you will actually use it at its potential i absolutely recommend it. If you are a casual user, however i recommend something less expensive.Windows users don't be afraid. There are more ways to run windows on a mac than you can shake a stick at... but DO NOT buy this computer just to run windows on it... just get a PC, its cheaper :PSo in short, this laptop is over the top, i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a powerhouse, but i strongly advise against this particular model for anyone looking for just casual computing. Anyway you go about it, Apple won't let you down. I finally understand why people say \"Once you go Mac, you never go back\".:D","Date":"April 7, 2011"}
{"Title":"Massive power, but I'm having a problem with this machine","Author":"DK","ReviewID":"R1UQPCHNSCPUDS","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the new Macbook Pro 15\" (from Amazon, thank you) the very first weekend it was released.  I produce videos for my company and felt like this was a super upgrade in power for me.The machine is now having problems with hard freezes when I try to render video.  The system fans start to rapidly build to around 6000 rpm and the machine goes into a state where the only option is a hard reset.  The machine is REALLY hot too.  At this point, I have noticed other postings on the Apple forums which suggest that this is a problem others are reporting about the new line.I realize I'm not offering much background at this time but I wanted to make it known in case anyone is considering a purchase.  Here is my immediate take:1)  If you feel you can benefit from the horsepower, I would definitely recommend this machine.2)  If you don't need it TODAY, wait about 30 days before purchasing and see how this plays out in the forums.I have an appointment with the Apple Genius Bar and I fully anticipate they will want to replace it.  Despite this issue, I still LOVE my Apple gear and will always recommend them.UPDATE:  I noted in later postings below that I have learned a little more about my issue.  As a result, I am revising my rate to be 5 stars since the problem appears to be related to a non-Apple application.","Date":"March 8, 2011"}
{"Title":"a great computer","Author":"Chaya","ReviewID":"R2WFH1PU3JG3UR","Overall":"good","Content":"The other reviewers went into the technical specs & construction, so I'll go with some real life experiences. I've been using this computer for over a week now and wanted to wait till everything was connected and all software tried out before commenting.My configuration is with the hi-res anti-glare screen & upgraded to 8 gigs of memory. The screen is breathtakingly sharp and the colors intense. If you are thinking of buying the computer, the extra $100 is definitely worth it for the hi-res option. Glossy or matte is a religious preference, so that won't be covered. The resolution is the same as a 20\" cinema display but in a 15\" package.Speed - yes! A 3d file I tried to render on my old MBP would have taken 24 hours. On this computer, it took less than one hour including anti-aliasing. This is a combination of the increased processor ability, better graphics card and more memory. How much upgrading you do will depend on the software you are using. If you are doing processor-intensive graphics, don't even hesitate before buying. In Photoshop, it opened a 34 MB RAW image immediately and a variety of filters were then applied, each without any processing delay.The cons:  - battery life has been overstated. I've been using the computer for two hours now - only doing web browsing and email, and the battery is almost half drained. Other days when running Parallels, games or graphics programs, it goes down a lot quicker. This isn't a surprise, but you need to know you can't fly cross country using the computer all day - it's not an iPad.  - display issues. There is a problem being the first one out the gate with new hardware, and I am having issues when connecting to an external monitor. Apple engineering is already working on it, and it may only be some configurations, so you may or may not want to wait before this is figured out.Migrating from an old Mac - this is the first time I've done this using the Migration Assistant software. Wow. Instead of spending a whole day recreating my customizations, they were all there the minute the computer started up. Word of warning - before you do this make sure you can connect both computers via Firewire (you'll need an adapter if the old one is still firewire 400), because it took 5 hours for the migration to happen over ethernet. Worth the wait - everything is there: the screen saver, browser history, preferences, etc. Even the printer worked without having to search for and install new drivers.In spite of the cons, I still give this computer 5 stars because one is a given (battery) and I'm sure the other will be worked out.","Date":"March 8, 2011"}

{"Title":"Little Pricey but a fantastic laptop.","Author":"Sam2Lucky13","ReviewID":"RD7J6WX2119FZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I just upgraded from the 2011 15 inch 2.0ghz MBP to the 2011 2.2 mostly because of the graphics card upgrade to a full gb. I also installed a new owc 240 gb mercury extreme pro 6g ssd along with 8gb of memory. To me it didnt make a whole lot of sense to spend that much money on extras and not go for the higher end model 15 inch.Ill be honest the 2.0 ghz version with 256mb of vmemory was more than enough and performs very well in comparison to the 2.2 version. Most people would never know the difference if they took the pepsi challenge.I am a label whore however and I couldnt sleep at night knowing there was more out there.The smart move and most cost effective however wouldve been to upgrade the 2.0 version mbp with probably the most stable and most reliable ssd in my opinion on the market and thats the samsung 470. it has a 3gbs data transfer rate so its not as fast as those in sata III and at 6gbps but again the difference in real world computing scenarios is negligible. It isnt however apple friendly and neither are the firmware updates if you have a mac.I wanted the fastest while  still conserving some reliability so an OWC ssd with a five year warranty and excellent customer service and the latest firmware included before shipment was the obvious choice over an OCZ. Both ssds are sata III and have a 6gbps data transfer rate.No other upgrade will make a bigger difference in the performance of your computer than an ssd. Dont waste your money on a substandard apple offering though, there's a lot better offerings in both ssds and memory out there.I will also never purchase another computer through anyone other than Amazon.My first 2011 mbp in 2.2 ghz showed up after riding around in a ups truck in 115 degree Phoenix heat all day...I dont know how hot the inside of the truck was where the cargo is kept but the computer on arrival was nearly too hot to handle with my bare hands, I knew there would be issues.The display was loose and unstable when opened and the battery took a health hit showing just 90% health...unacceptable for a brand new 2000 dollar computer.I had zero problems getting a replacement and a morning delivery time. It was sent and arrived in one business day, and before I could send UPS's goof back to amazon...I was already using my new one. The reliability, discount, plus zero tax always makes me wonder why anyone would buy anywhere else. Any way just my thoughts hope they may help someone.I did take one star for price and the cost of the apple name and like I said I wouldve been just as happy with the performance of the 2.0 ghz version if i werent so neurotic.Just one more quick edit...the free upgrade to lion from apple's website couldn't be easier.","Date":"July 20, 2011"}
{"Title":"Returning to the Mac","Author":"Philip Brooks","ReviewID":"R2JSH1E8HCISQZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I used the Mac from 1984 to 1995 at which time I switched to Windows, since I retired and was starting to work as a computer consultant and the people who needed help were all Window users. After making a good income helping Window users for over ten years, I bought an iPhone and was so impressed I decided to look into the current Macs. What a pleasant surprise. It's really a joy to again use a computer that is fun to use and you don't have to spend all that time keeping it running, as I did in Windows. I still have a need to run a few programs in Windows, such as Access, so I installed Parallels Desktop for the Mac 6 and can now use Windows when I have no other choice. The MacBook Pro 15 is without a doubt the best investment I have made in years. If you want to see what the computers of the future are going to look like checkout the last Macs.","Date":"April 21, 2011"}
{"Title":"First time Apple owner is ecstatic","Author":"nascarlurg \"nascarlurg\"","ReviewID":"R3EHVP1EMW1RM4","Overall":"good","Content":"Well this is the first Macbook I have ever owned and to say the least, I am not sorry about spending a little extra. The quality of this Aluminum notebook is unbelievable. To get this from Amazon also, just makes my purchase that much better. When Apple released the 2011 refresh with this Sandybridge chip I jumped on it. I actually was one of the first consumers to get this Intel chipset in an HP notebook that was part of the recall because of the mother board. I was able to use the notebook for a few weeks and was amazed how fast and powerful this chip was. Then I had to send it back but heard Apple was releasing this model.So when I seen that Apple was also using it, I couldn't resist. The chip can multitask like business and the new ATI graphics HD 6750M is a great addition. I am running Windows 7 Pro in bootcamp and all Windows programs run perfectly as do graphic intensive games. The 1 GB of GDDR5 Ram really help textures in games fly. I am very happy with the gaming capability as well as my work capabilities. I am running Adobe CS5 and even with only 4GB of Ram for now...it really hasn't slowed at all.....the Sandybridge is more than strong enough for video encoding. You can do so much all at one time it isn't funny. I think eventually I will upgrade to 8GB of RAM when I find it for the right price.So and professional that wants this notebook for work and play wont be disappointed.","Date":"February 28, 2011"}
{"Title":"Recent Convert!","Author":"tbidder","ReviewID":"R2QDUOCPXZSVAK","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought this as a late Christmas/off-to-graduate-school present for son, who insisted on waiting until the newest model came out. He had never had a Mac before, having been raised on Windows computers. Transition to new operating system happened almost overnight. He bought whatever software he needed to actually work in the Windows world as well as the Mac world, as he does some web development and app programming. He says that the processor speed, video board, disk access (even though only 5400) are incredibly superior to the high-end Dell this laptop replaces. We read the reviews by the Mac-o-philes who complain about reduced battery life and other sub-par aspects, but for someone switching platforms, we have none of the nirvana Macs to compare to. The super-long battery life allows him to work through lengthy classes with having to search for power. He is absolutely in love with this computer, and keeps insisting that I switch too. This one comes highly recommended, from a geek moving from Windows to Mac. One more note: I bought this just as the computer was coming out and watched prices over a number of days before actually buying from Amazon. Amazon consistently had the best total price overall, thanks to low price + no shipping cost + no sales tax.  Glad I bought here.","Date":"May 12, 2011"}

{"Title":"Worthy upgrade for an older MBP","Author":"DWhite","ReviewID":"RL60FGY1AIRPR","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this computer to replace my 5 year old core 2 duo Mac Book Pro. I knew that I would see performance improvements and I have been pleased with how much this new computer is improved over the old one. I upgraded to 8 GB RAM (self installed) and the upgrade is well worth it. RAM hungry programs that I would really never run at the same time (Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Indesign) now happily run along side each other. 3D rendering is much faster. No comparison between the old MBP and this new one for 3d or video encoding - huge improvement.I needed to upgrade and decided to go for the extra horsepower and am happy with my decision. My old MBP was not a unibody. This one feels much more solid and better built.","Date":"April 17, 2011"}
{"Title":"Best Computer I've Ever Used!","Author":"Jake","ReviewID":"R2RDYYBQWWLDR1","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recently purchased one of these laptops.  I had mine customized by Apple - a 1680x1050 high-res screen and 500GB 7200RPM hard drive instead of the 750GB 5400RPM.  I am extremely glad that I did.The screen is wonderful on it.  I previously owned a 2008 MacBook Pro 15.4\" with a 1440x900 matte screen, and I much prefer the glass-covered high-res screen on the new one.  I sat them side-by-side and the color difference is tremendous.  Obviously, the pixel density on the new one is also iPhone4-like, and great for typing or reading.  At one time I had a 23\" computer monitor that was the same resolution as this 15.4\" MBP, so it is really amazing.  It's also great how easy it is to really clean the screen on this new computer - since it is all glass you can put a bit of water on the cleaning cloth and it gets perfectly clean.The internal hardware in this new MBP is also flat-out incredible.  I have purchased Windows 7 Pro for it to run in Boot Camp in case I need it for work and had a very interesting find.  I also own a self-built gaming desktop I made a couple of years ago, which scores a 5.2 on the Windows Experience Index.  Get this - the new laptop scores a 5.9!  Its quad-core i7 processor scores 7.6 and the AMD graphics scores a 7.  Its hardware is comparable to a $3000 Windows gaming laptop, but it gets twice the battery life!  I have also purchased a 1TB external hard drive from Seagate that has FireWire 800, USB 3, and eSATA support.  They have promised in the future that they will make a Thunderbolt connector for it, so it will work even faster on this laptop.Other great features of the new MBP are 4GB of DDR3 RAM, an HD webcam built-in, backlit keyboard, and its SDXC card slot.  As a photographer, I am much happier to have an SD slot instead of the ExpressCard slot on my old MBP.  I was originally going to wait this summer for the new MacBook Air, but I am very glad I purchased the Pro instead.  Yes, it is heavier and thicker, but 10 times as powerful and has a better screen!Some people complain about these being \"too expensive for what they are\" or \"just made for Apple fanboys\" but the truth is neither statement is correct.  They are just the most reliable and well-built laptops on the planet, and run very fast and long on one battery charge.  Things like a lack of BluRay or USB 3 are not really a big deal, given that Thunderbolt will be 10 times faster than USB 3 and BluRay is not really necessary when you can easily download high-def movies or use Netflix.  If really obsessed with BluRay, just get a slim external drive and use Windows on Boot Camp.  MacOS X Lion is currently the best operating system in production, with tons of features but very easy to learn everything on.  iPhoto, Mail, and Safari are excellent programs for daily use - very simple yet feature-filled, and now can be full-screen.I highly recommend this computer to anyone who wants a fast, powerful, and long-lasting laptop.  Unlike almost all other companies, Apple products retain value a lot better, as they tend to last longer and are much more reliable.  I sold my previous MBP quickly, for about half of what I paid for it 3 years ago, something rarely seen when selling older computers.  My suggestion would be to buy this computer, customize it with a high-res screen if you always work with photos or videos, and buy Windows 7 OEM if needed.  Windows OEM is much cheaper than the full version and it is made for installing to new computers - $129 for Windows 7 Pro compared to $299 for the full version.  The only slight issue with Windows is that unlike in MacOS, the system will not automatically switch graphics cards to save battery.  Therefore, in Windows it is always on the high-power graphics and battery life drops from 7 hours to about 4-5, which is still better than battery on 99% of high-power Windows laptops.As someone who has owned 10 or 12 PCs, 3 Macs, and worked on 6-core brand-new servers, I am just amazed at the speed and power of this new MacBook!  Much better rated than any other computer I have ever used, and even open to higher speed given that I chose to stick with the 2.2Ghz i7 instead of paying $300 more for the 2.3Ghz.  Also, 8GB of RAM is an option, as well as up to 512GB SSDs, which would offer much better data read/write than even my 7200RPM normal drive.  If you are looking for a new, fast, reliable, powerful laptop, look no further.  You've found it!","Date":"July 24, 2011"}
{"Title":"New to Mac.","Author":"Occasional Amazonian \"Andrew\"","ReviewID":"R2D5UG6RB1E689","Overall":"good","Content":"I've used Macs on and off before out of necessity and to be honest I was never really impressed with the user experience since it was so strange. Now, with more regular use, it's not so strange.Here are some thoughts in no particular order:1. The first thing I noticed was that the Mac experience is a very curated one. Whereas someone with a handle on Windows will be flying around the OS in no time, manipulating files at will and changing settings, your options are far more limited on a Mac. Sometimes you bounce into limits due to ignorance and other times because they are real limits.For example, full-screen windows are still a pain. Maximizing windows does not automatically produce the effect it does on a Windows PC. You still have to drag the bottom right corner of the application to make it full-sized. I still, however, have been unable to figure out how to change the system font size. Beware, it's tiny--and I'm not so old.2. Multitouch is very, very useful; but on the other hand I do miss Aerosnap. Two-finger scrolling does away with the mockery that is the scrollbar on a regular laptop.3. This thing is built solidly. You realize this when you subsequently handle other laptops. The \"brick\" is a bit odd (I have seen this shape on older Macs) but that's just a matter of personal opinion.The magnetically attached cord seems like a good idea.4. \"It just works\": There may be some truth to this. I plugged in two different printers (one with a scan function) and if you've ever had to deal with HP and their drivers on Windows you'd be shocked. They just worked--full-featured and all. No need to download anything.5. This thing gets hot sometimes--too hot to put on your lap.6. Flipping through files is a bit more awkward than on Windows. I'm still trying to figure this out.7. Installing applications is sometimes confusing--but I guess I will learn; although there does not seem to be a standard procedure.8. The battery takes a long time to charge and a long time to discharge (compare to other laptops I have used). You get a lot of time on the battery.This is all I can remember for now.I would buy another Mac if possible because of the sturdiness. The OS takes a little getting used to.Will I ever \"go back\"?Well, I never \"left\". I will say that things have been encouraging so far--including Safari (the browser I was not initially impressed with--being more partial to Chrome). I still do use Windows PCs and I like the way they encourage tinkering etc. I am sold on the idea of Apple laptops as far as durability goes. Maybe in the future I might buy other Apple products.Lastly, I am considering the OSX Lion upgrade later this year after all the kinks have been worked out.","Date":"June 20, 2011"}

It's super powerful and it looks amazing. I bought the Corsair 8 Gb RAM upgrade and put those in before I even turned my MacBook Pro on for the first time. Worked perfectly. The only problem I ran into was that one of the fans was making some awful noise. A couple of taps to the fan got it back in place and running totally silently.I also set up Boot Camp and loaded Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit. It runs great.

{"Title":"Sandy Bridge goodness, even better with 8GB RAM.","Author":"JuanGuapo","ReviewID":"R2T04JUY906SHI","Overall":"good","Content":"Short and sweet: You really do get what you pay for, especially with computers. The customer support is in North America and you can take it to a Genius Bar with questions. Sandy Bridge processor is a quad-core monster (8 with HT) that only gets better with an 8GB RAM upgrade--it makes iMovie cook 1080p video in nothing flat. I've had my MBP for several weeks, it it's a screamer with iMovie videos.Lion Upgrade: I bought mine a few weeks before Lion was released so I was able to get the free upgrade. The upgrade went very smoothly, took approximately 30 minutes (not including download time).Three things I love....a) Everything works as it should, boots quickly, and has killer battery life. (Free upgrade to Lion was a nice touch)b) Fit and finish is top-notch. The display has the best contrast I've seen yet. Sound quality blows away the \"Beats Audio\" I had on my DV7.c) Relatively cool to the touch. Will warm up under heavy load. Not suitable for using on your lap, get a coolpad or put it on a table.Three things that are neither here nor there....a) Thunderbolt port. No major accessories on the market yet. 10Gbps up/down is nice to have as future-proofing.b) Unibody construction, very few things to take apart. 10 screws to remove the bottom and upgrade the RAM. Built like a Swiss watch inside.c) Backlit keyboard is a nice touch. I generally turn it off but it's handy when you're in a dark room.Things that I didn't like....a) Apple only supports Windows 7 for Boot Camp on this machine. I realize XP is now out of date but I still use it for some things. VMWare Fusion 3 runs it fine, though.b) USB ports are only on one side.c) SD card slot only. Sucks for those of us who use MemoryStick or MSP.","Date":"August 15, 2011"}

{"Title":"Great Computer!","Author":"David Bradshaw","ReviewID":"R2RMEJWN1L3ZMI","Overall":"good","Content":"First off this computer feels well built.  It is sturdy, and solid (no cheap feeling plastic or hollow points inside).  The computer is really thin, and looks good.  The OS is very easy to use and was ready to go after I typed in my name and basic info.  The OS found my wireless printer instantly (using Bonjour) and downloaded the HP software without me doing anything (other than going to Print and selecting my Printer).  The screen looks really good, and even though it is not full HD it looks very good.  The DVD drive is nice and sucks disks in when you put the disk in (like the PS3), the only weird thing is that you have to put the disk almost all the way in before it pulls it in.  This model has 2 USB ports, which are good for cables, however, if you are trying to use a flash drive, you may not be able to utilize both ports with the another cable in (depends on your device and equipment).  The power adapter that comes with the computer is really nice, it is magnetic so if you hit the cable it just falls out; the power cable also has a handy pop out hand that ties the cable nicely, so you do not have a bunch of cables hanging out.  The computer does not have a VGA/DVI/HDMI out port, so you have to buy an adapter to use an external monitor, the computer easily recognizes when to use which monitor (when both are open it extends display (unless you specify to clone) or if you close the MacBook Pro the External monitor goes at its native resolution.  I use a 21\" HP monitor and it works fine (when extending or External only) at 1080p.OS X is really nice.  It is super easy to use and learn (it takes a while to get use to if you try to do everything like you would in Windows).  The settings are pretty straightforward, and Spotlight search is really good at finding what you need.  the Mail app and Calendar app work well with my Gmail account.  If you are a developer then you will find Xcode very useful (which is free from the App Store), and if you are like me and have a few Windows applications that you have to have, Bootcamp is super easy to setup.  Specify how big a partition to give to Windows, download the Windows Drivers CD file, and then insert the Windows 7 CD.  Write to the proper partition (follow Bootcamp's instructions (download or print before starting)), and then once you are in Windows put the driver CD to get Windows to recognize the hardware.  To boot into Windows in the future hold down Option or Alt (depends on which keyboard you use) at startup (if you get the Apple logo you missed it) and get the boot menu.  Windows works very well in the MacBook Pro and sees 8 Processors (4 Cores, 4 Virtual Cores from the Intel i7).  Windows only seems to use the ATI Graphics card, not the Intel Graphics, because Windows does use the switch graphics card like the Mac does.  Windows can also take advantage of the external display using the adapter (Start + P) to change external display settings in Windows.  Also, when in Mac OS X I see that my battery time remaining (when just surfing the web) usually shows 7.5 hours, as you perform tasks the time remaining automatically changes, to show how much battery you have using the current task. -- Note, this battery is not changeable, you have to have Apple change it (like the iPhone)The computer that I got (from Amazon) came with Lion, so I did not have to upgrade, however, Lion no longer includes the backup disks that were included with previous MacBook Pros.  Because of this you have a recovery partition on the HDD, and you do not get iWeb and iDVD(which would normally be on the iLife disk, so that is sort of disappointing -- you do get iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand).In the end, this computer is very well built, and should last a long time (since it is very sturdy), the computer is also very powerful and should be beyond adequate for quite some time in the future.  I hope to get a long life out of this computer, and since it can support Mac and Windows it should be able to accomplish everything!  I really like the computer, and hope to have it for some time.  If anything changes I will post it here!","Date":"October 10, 2011"}

{"Title":"Wonderful, But Overpriced","Author":"Mayflower Girl \"amazon-junkie since 1996\"","ReviewID":"R29PEFTHDTNDDV","Overall":"good","Content":"So, I love my MacBook Pro.  I didn't buy mine off of Amazon, but got it custom from Mac--so it's a slightly different setup.  I went with the high speed hard drive, which is only 500 GB.  I had a Mac Powerbook way back in the early 90s that zoomed at 33 Mhz.  LOL  Things have improved.  Lots to like... nothing too surprising...some of the good things:1) Fast.2) Very intuitive platform like all macs.3) Looks great.4) Safer in terms of virus, etc.5) Offer 14 day return if bought in store (Apple Store) without a restocking fee, which is nice. (Ended up ordering two to compare screens, and returning one.)6) High Res--whites much brighter, grays better, colors better--which is to be expected.7)Trackback functionality is great.  Can zoom up and down and scroll very easily, flip pages, etc.8) Cheap to upgrade OS.  $35 or so vs. $200 for any Windows machine.Now some of the bad (minor criticisms, I realize):1)Don't offer OS back-up CDs anymore.  Very difficult as customer to create it on your own.2)DVD Drive doesn't have Blueray, and it's crap--HP.  Makes a ton of noise.  Can easily scratch DVDs if move computer while running.  (Had two different MacBook Pros--same issue with both.)3)Wonder about the safety of the Apple on the back of the screen.  If you touch it, you can actually see your finger on the screen.  Wonder if you'd be totally screwed if computer hit in some way.4) Pain that they don't have High Res w/ glossy in stores--so difficult to compare.  Had to order both to see which I liked--and then return another one.5) Battery on high res w/ high speed hard drive 7200 RPMs not great. Only have about 4 hours battery life.6) Choose not running in native resolution on High Res, end up in much lower than even the standard res.Just so you know, you can upgrade and do things yourself.  Don't believe that you can't open it yourself.  They show you how in the directions.  Memory, etc. totally overpriced through the Apple Store, but can do it yourself for 1/4 the price.  I also truly believe that one could probably put the MacOS on a Toshiba for like $600.00. ;)","Date":"September 9, 2011"}

If you plan on running intense programs add at least 8GB of RAM. Nice extras like the lit Apple, back-lit keyboard, aluminum body, track pad gestures and the chicklet keyboard are awesome.

The styling is attractive to the eye and it's a very powerful little machine. 15\" really feels perfect compared to the 13\" or the 17\". The i7 processor makes this computer really fly. There hasn't been anything that I've tried tht this computer can't handle. I did install windows 7 on it through bootcamp to play a few games. The dedicated video card handles all modern games perfectly and can do max graphic settings on almost all of them.A special note would be to mention that this computer does get very warm while doing heavy graphic work. This is completely normal and is why it is considered a portable computer rather than a laptop. It is very uncomfortable to use on your lap due to the heat. I'd strongly recommend a portable desk if you do choose to use it on your lap. I bought a Logitech portable desk and it runs perfectly without becoming uncomfortable.

{"Title":"Has potential but there are a ton of little problems that detract from the experience.","Author":"J. Mulnix","ReviewID":"R1EZGB69QN5363","Overall":"good","Content":"Review updated, see below.Overall this is without a doubt the fastest laptop I have ever used.  Period.  My complaints start with the fact that if you use either Chrome or Firefox and set the brightness of the display to between 50-60% you will not get the advertised battery time.  I struggle to get 4 hours, usually I get about 3 instead of the 7ish that Apple advertises.  Another complaint I have is with the heat this laptop puts off, it is hot enough to be at the maximum of what Intel recommends for the i7.  I have recorded processor temperatures above 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  For a $2,200 laptop this is unacceptable.  Old Pentium 4 Dells from a decade ago ran cooler.  The case seems to be designed with visual aesthetics in mind, not good thermal management.  As for these two issues I have spoken on the Phone with Apple support and supposedly high temperatures are within \"normal\" and the battery life can very.My last major complaint is with the Thunderbolt port, all it does is cause problems.  I have a Samsung Syncmaster that works occasionally with this computer.  Another problem is my MacBook seems to think that I have a monitor hooked up even when there is nothing plugged in, whatever program I used on the external monitor does not show up on the laptop screen.  Even after multiple restarts and shutdown/power on cycles I still have this problem.With all of the little nagging issues I and numerous other users have had, read the apple forums, I can't recommend that someone spend over $2K on this laptop.  Until there are driver updates to fix all of the issues me and loads of other users have experienced I would say hold off on the purchase.If Apple issues updates I will gladly change my review but until they admit there are problems with cooling and Thunderbolt I can't give this laptop a higher score.Apple please fix these issues, they seem to be very widespread!Update 1: Apparently I have angered the Apple gods because I now have a keyboard that will not backlight even in a dark room, really Apple?Update 2: Another issue I can add to my growing list of irritations with this laptop.  It takes anywhere between 45 seconds to over a minute and a half for my laptop to go to sleep.  Either closing the lid or using the keyboard shortcut to sleep the computer results in a lot of waiting.  It is quicker to shut the computer down and restart it than it is to sleep it for me.Update 3: After using this laptop for about 2 weeks now I am overall satisfied with my purchase.  There are still a few issues I have but unfortunately the heat issue seems to be a problem across all MacBook Pros.  For some reason the screen and keyboard dimmer issues I had are now gone.  Sleeping still takes a while but its tolerable.I will say this laptop is FAST.  Rendering 720p video is near real time.  If you have a 10 minute video expect the render time to be about 10 minutes.If you can splurge get the SSD option, its the one thing I am doing as soon as the price of a 500 gig SSD comes down to a reasonable amount.  Except for the heat this laptop puts off I am very happy with my purchase.  The overall experience is very good.  On a minor note I am pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoy typing on the keyboard, coming from a ThinkPad keyboard I have VERY high standards for my laptop keyboard, and while not as good as a ThinkPad the Pro's keyboard is still very nice.If you need to do video editing, photo work, or any graphic design and you need to be mobile this is the laptop for you!","Date":"April 4, 2011"}

{"Title":"Amazing machine","Author":"Smart Little Magpie","ReviewID":"R11A3T2ESFND8U","Overall":"good","Content":"I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","Date":"December 13, 2008"}

{"Title":"Awesome","Author":"C. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}

Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.

The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!","Date":"December 30, 2008"}
{"Title":"So much to say...","Author":"Scott D. Espenschied \"ScoDal\"","ReviewID":"R2VGRT0I45JFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.","Date":"December 14, 2012"}

This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.  Colors are vibrant and black levels are the deepest I've seen in a portable.Highly recommended.","Date":"April 10, 2009"}

{"Title":"Beautiful Laptop","Author":"S. Webb","ReviewID":"R17OT3NYH42LLI","Overall":"good","Content":"I upgraded my PowerBook 17 to the new MacBook Pro 15. It's a beautiful machine. Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

My only peeve is that the hard drive is not a true 320GB hard drive (298?). Other than that, this laptop blows all of the rest out of the water. On Boot camp, a vista OS never had it so good with the ultra crisp graphics and and vivid color. That is the only thing that vista have over leopard, but leopard eats it up overall. Highly recommended if you want the best of both worlds in OSes, this is it and no other. That alone in my book makes this system worth every penny and once you go mac.......you never go back! My Imac pushed me away from PC's and there is no more need other than other particular things that windows do that OS X do not. Great investment, worth every dollar in my opinion.

As an educator, this will do everything I need it to do with MS Office, iLife including iPhoto and iMovie, and a few productivity apps. I'm not running Final Cut Pro but even this Core 2 Duo still flies through the things I use it for. I'm not a gamer either so why pay thousands for a 1000 HP motor if a 357 Chevy will get you there in style? This is one of the Apple bargains right now in my opinion. I'm in love with this loaded-with-power and beauty laptop! I also have an iMac desktop so the combination of the two makes a great duo that does everything I need very impressively!

You can even define the bottom left and right areas to be buttons if that is how you like it to be.The glass cover of the LED backlit LCD screen does give it a glossy look. There are some reflections. In my use, I have no problems with the glass covered screen. I like that it is protected by glass. The display is very bright. The addition of an on-board video chip as well as a separate video card makes for great graphics options.The ability to easily swap out the hard drive is a welcome change on the Macbook Pro line.I have had no problems with it.

The zoom and rotate gestures are way too sensitive and are easily activated unintentionally making Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, etc. almost unusable. Adobe has got to correct this very annoying problem. One more thing, the edge of the unibody where your palms rest is sharp. I took some sandpaper and rounded it off a bit.

Analyzing the product from a computer first timer perspective, there is no doubt that will beat any intuitive machine contest in the world. Perhaps is like almost everything else in life: just a matter to get used to it, but if you asked me now, after having the machine with me for a couple of weeks, and still having this frustration sense of knowing what I'd like to do, but don't knowing how to get it done, I would think it twice before getting into the mac world.","Date":"July 24, 2009"}
{"Title":"Good choice for non-techie user.  Increased usability however comes at a price.","Author":"Seth Eliot","ReviewID":"R1T95CISXB3TBA","Overall":"good","Content":"This review is for the MB470LL/A (2.4GHZ CPU, 2GB Memory, 250GB Hard Drive) MacBook Pro released in late 2008.  I bought this machine for my wife who had been using Windows machines for years, but never really \"got into\" them.  I thought that Mac, known for its superior usability and user interface design might be a better choice for her.  The rest of this review is in her words.Let me begin by saying the following:  I am a non techie, first time laptop owner.  I have not owned any previous Macs, and all my previous experience is from a Windows PC.  What I wanted from a computer was a place to keep all my photos, music, stories (I enjoy writing), etc; nothing extreme, just the everyday stuff that most people probably use their computer for.  Why I wanted a laptop was because I have a little girl (9 months currently) and I wanted to be able to write from anywhere while still being able to keep an eye on her.  So please take everything I write with this info in mind.I had heard that Mac software was fairly intuitive, and being the above said non technical person, that was a big draw for me.  Macs come with iLife, which is the bundle of programs including iTunes, iPhoto, iChat, iMovie, etc. - basically all your everyday home life programs.  The only thing that the Mac did not have included that I needed was a word processing program.  To get that, I decided to go with the Microsoft office for Mac, which obviously was purchased separately.So here are my thoughts on this computer based on having lived with it for a little less than a month...The computer itself is gorgeous.  I had never really looked at laptops before, but since getting this computer, I have been comparing it to my friends' non-Mac laptops, and I am blown away by the difference in looks.  The Mac is sleeker, better designed, the trackpad is larger.  You have a camera already installed in the Mac.  For pure aesthetic pleasure, it is Mac all the way.The screen is indeed glossy.  So far, this has not bothered me, with the caveat that as of this moment, I have not taken it outside of the home, so I've been able to control the light that hits it.  Since I bought this laptop to use inside of a home, this screen works for me, but I would highly recommend that anyone who will be using this screen in multiple lighting situations go to a Mac Store and check out the screen first hand.  It could definitely be a deal breaker for some people.I love the keyboard.  For my background, I am someone who types over 100 words a minute, and has spent several years in a clerical capacity where keyboards and I were very well acquainted.  Since my biggest worry about getting a laptop was if I would like the keyboard or not, the fact that I am so happy speaks volumes.I have found that using the Mac software has been almost as good as advertised.  I have been able to get it running with very few problems, and the couple times I have been stuck, Apple has given a lot of help options.  There is a help window where you can type a question and it will give you several options to click.  Also, on the apple site there are tons of info videos and podcasts that you can watch or read to get answers to your questions.  I have yet to have a problem where one of these two options did not get me the answer to solve it.The trackpad is the big breakthrough for this new Mac.  I won't go into detail about how to use it, you can find that elsewhere.  All I will say in regards to this is that I've found it to be fairly easy to get used to these features, and now that I'm used to it, I can't imagine not using it.The speakers sound wonderful; I often play my music just from my Mac.  Obviously, I'm not trying to say these replace your home sound system, but you can comfortably play a movie without wincing about the sound quality.Not all is perfect though.  There are a few things you should be aware of, especially if this is your first Mac purchase.First, you have the `option' of purchasing a warranty.  However, considering the Mac is a closed system with not a lot of fix options outside of Apple, it really isn't an option; it's something you need to get unless you are a gambler.  So that is an automatic almost $400 more on top of the MacBook price.Speaking of MacBook prices, I probably don't have to tell you that you pay a premium for Macs.  You can get a PC Laptop with just as good (or perhaps a slight bit better) specs for about half the price., such as this example: [HP Pavilion DV7-1150US 17-Inch Laptop (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T5800 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium)]Another problem is if you (like I) have family and friends that have mostly PC's, it is hard to get some cross platforming things going.  For example, it has been really difficult to find a video chat program that works on both sides.  We have ultimately decided we would run Windows for Mac on this computer to solve these type of problems.  I will admit that it is nice to have this option, but once again, that is yet another start up expense you have to consider.Apple does have a tendency to nickel and dime you.  A lot of small things you would assume would be included often have to be purchased separately, and the only one who sells these things are... Apple.Also I've my machine may have a design defect.  I noticed that if I use the two prong charger (it comes with both 2 and 3 prong) I sometimes feel a slight electrical \"vibration\".  This issue has been found by others, details are on the Apple discussion board at [...] (if amazon removes the previous link from this review, simply put \"New Macbook Pro 2.53GHz (Late 2008) Vibration Palm Rest\" into google to find it).To sum it up, as of right now, I really love my Mac.  I'm incredibly happy with the way it works, and how it is so easy to use for the things I use it for.  I still get giddy every time I see it, and I love talking about it.  I will probably update this review in about a year to let you know how it's going and if I still feel this way, but right now, I can say in all honesty, if you are comfortable spending the money for it, go for the MacBook Pro.","Date":"November 16, 2008"}

Dells suck terribly and even though you are paying a lot more up front for the mac and you might not be used to it at first, in the long run you are saving money and its just a way better computer. Dell screwed me over with tons of money and three computers that all became outdated very quick and even crashed, I have yet to encounter a problem with my mac and I do alot of work with music on it! Seriously the best investment I ever made, I will never consider buying windows again. The best part about this computer is the touch trackpad for the mouse, once you understand how to use all of its features, which is pretty quick, you will wish every computer had one.

I just picked up the standard configuration my University bookstore carries.  It is fine.  After using migration tool it kept resetting the timezone to GMT and I had to do a google search and run a few terminal commands to fix.  The reason for this review is the screen.  Don't buy it with the glossy mirror screen.  Please special order the matte finish.  I'm not sensitive to reflections but this is crazy.  Any light in the room and you pretty much just stare at yourself in the screen.  I won't return it for this, but I do regret not ordering the matte screen.

I just want to say that i don't give 5 stars to this magnific electronic piece just for the dissapointing issue that at this price this 15 inch macbook pro it's not preloaded with ilife '09 as Imacs do. Even the white macbook ($1300 less) comes preloaded with ilife '09. I have to spend about $60 more if i want to enjoy Ilife '09. We paid a lot more of cash and we have to pay more if we want to see running this software on our notebooks. Is not fair.

I installed Windows XP to run natively and reinstalled my office apps (Word, Powerpoint, etc.) and have not had a crash in two weeks. On my Dell laptop, I was calling customer service at times as much as twice a week to track down driver issues and bugginess with their built-in graphics processor.This thing is rock solid, both in terms of Mac OS X (10.5.5) and the well designed construction of the hardware. Can't believe I ever put up with a PC laptop for so long!Would have been nice if Apple included a Firewire 800 cable or even the mini-display port-to-VGA connector for the $2000 price tag, but Apple is irritating like that. They don't even ship the Apple Remote with their computers anymore.Fast. Solid construction. Highly innovative technology. Well worth the investment.","Date":"December 8, 2008"}
{"Title":"Great computer HORRIBLE quality control","Author":"PodGirl","ReviewID":"R2J1LZXPF8WG1D","Overall":"good","Content":"I love everything about this machine and it would have gotten 5 starts in book except for the atrocious quality control on apple's part. I went through three of these unibody MBP's and wound up opting to just get a full refund. All three I owned, plus the display models in my local store had warped lids meaning, when the notebook was closed there was a noticeable gap between the lid and the bottom of the machine. When you picked up the machine you could actually feel the lid moving down.. This is unacceptable for such an expensive machine from a company that claims to pride itself on quality. One of the machines had a faulty optical drive and two felt as if there was something loose and clunking around inside the casing when I picked them up, even when they were turned off. I was lucky enough not to get one that had a loose battery cover, tons of dead pixels, or slanted keys on the keyboard. These all seem to be common issues with these new mpb's. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of quality control.This is a beautiful machine but, if you have an apple store near you, I'd suggest buying it directly from the store so that if there is a problem you can go right back there and deal with it immediately.","Date":"November 4, 2008"}

My family doesn't have a ton of expendable income, but dad found a great deal on the inspiron 1525 from Best Buy as a back to school special. 3 years later, and I am writing this review on it. For one who is not being completely tech savvy, this was a great starter laptop. It is easy to use and was really affordable for something that was going to get a lot of use out of it. The first year I had it, there was a problem with the hard drive and it had to be replaced but Best Buy and Dell were able to help me out with that and I actually got a better one out of the ordeal while it was covered by the warranty (cha ching!). Besides Mac's, I can easily say I've seen more 1525's around campus than any other computer. period. it's user friendly and it has all the functionality a student needs: web browser, CD/ DVD drive, wifi, etc. It can do anything I would need it to do. I've had a good experience and if I was ever going to get another laptop, I would definitely consider a Dell.","Date":"September 19, 2010"}

My reasons are that Im hard on my computers, they go everywhere with me. This laptop now is almost my stationary computer in my house, its used everyday, rarely ever shut off, and has been put through its trials quite a few times. I have never owned a better laptop.CONS: The case is a bit cheap, where the plastic meets the hinges is an easy place to break, the fan can be quite loud at times, and the laptop is NOT balanced, the back of the laptop and the monitor outweigh the front, so it flops onto its back if its in your lap. Speakers suck too, but I never use them.PROS: Cheap, good for games, pretty quick, 2 headphone ports + mic port, 4 usb ports, easy to work on, cheap to repair, takes just about any hard drive (mine is out of a Mac, running windows xp pro).IF YOU WANT ANYTHING NEWER THAN VISTA, FORGET BUYING THIS COMPUTER","Date":"April 18, 2013"}

First thing I did was replace the LED Screens and the inverters , to improve the quality of the view of the Laptops. Then I replaced the fans and upgraded the 1.73 GHz Celeron to 2.0 GHz T7100 Intel Dual Core CPU's for my wife's and Intel T8100 Dual core 2,2GHz  on my Dell and upgraded to 4 Gig of Ram on the Memory. And used a excellent quality of Thermal Paste Cooler Master G7, and replaced the keyboard with a better quality keyboard that interchanges with other Dell laptop's, and then I also replaced the power jack's, so the AC Adapters would be nice and tight,when you plug it in and power it up, and this has been the best laptop I have ever reconditioned. It is blazing fast and I upgraded the Hard Drive to 1TB Western Digital, and purchased a Hard Drive Caddy and mounted a 500 Gig Hard Drive in the DVD Bay, and I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, and Vista Ultimate 32 Bit on the same Laptop. No issues or problems at all. So for the buck it was worth it,and I have a laptop that,is kick ass. And what I love is the HDMI port that comes in handy to hook up a LED TV Monitor it helps for those with eyesight problems like my wife. So, for those who have negative things to say about it it would help if you do some research on the product and see what the Pro's are instead of focusing on the Con's. I like this little laptop so much I plan on tweaking another one\". for what I have done to mine alone just upped the value of this Laptop from $299,00 brand new with just the 1.73 Ghz to $999.00 with two OS's and the upgrades and including new paint job's in reconditioning these Laptop's. So, for those who want a reasonable priced Laptop that can be upgraded and improved over time I think Dell has done ok since the laptop was introduced in 2007.

Too bad a lot of the computers now aren't coming with pci which is pretty handy.  It has all the hardware features you need, including a card reader and 4 usb 2.0 ports and hdmi port, firewire, even an svideo port.  Another nice thing is the dual headphone jacks for when you watch something with another person. Really, this computer is quite nice. Can upgrade the ram to 4G, right now I have 3 G.  Once a key broke off and replaced it easily for 5 bucks.  Replacing/upgrading parts is pretty easy on this computer too.  I don't have any hinge probs.

Edwards","ReviewID":"RDVNEMVUTF6RV","Overall":"good","Content":"While I had heard more than a few complaints about the quality and longevity of Dell laptops, I recently needed one quickly and as cost efficiently as possible. After some comparative shopping, it became clear that Dell could fulfill these requirements better than their competitors.I ordered the Inspiron 1525 with the exact same specifications as those listed on this page, with the exception of a 150GB hard drive, directly from Dell (I would recommend doing the same as, at the time of this posting, the price dealing through Dell directly is almost three hundred dollars cheaper). I was not expecting much for the price, but I have been pleasantly surprised. It should be mentioned that I am by no means a computer expert and I do not use my laptop for anything special outside of work and surfing the internet. However, I do utilize some statistics and data charts that my last laptop labored over while this computer seems to remain unfazed and unburdened. Aside from its speed and power, which I am in no way disappointed with, I also find it to be aesthetically pleasing. The screen is larger and more vivid than I had anticipated, the overall design is sleek, and it will pass as professional. All of this said, it is a good laptop, good looking, handles what I throw at it, and priced to sell at the moment if purchased through Dell.As for the apparent negatives, I have convinced myself that I have only heard so many complaints because I know so many more individuals that own Dells as opposed to any other brand, and have been comforted by a recommendation from a friend who is also a local college's IT supervisor.","Date":"November 21, 2008"}
{"Title":"Not so bad, except...","Author":"Davey","ReviewID":"R17JU2299JQ9CM","Overall":"good","Content":"I only feel compelled to write a review about this computer because of all the bad ones on here. I have had this laptop for a little over two years, and it has survived with few problems. My laptop has a 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo in it, and only 2Gb of ram. When it comes to multitasking, this computer does not shine, but for everyday paper writing and web surfing and the like, its just fine as long as you don't have a million tabs open in your browser. I consider myself a rather tech oriented guy, so a little preventative maintenance was all I needed to keep this computer running. I have not had many of the problems many have, such as the hinge breaking or the mouse buttons sticking. I have watched and monitored my computer for viruses like a hawk, so that has not been a problem. The only problem that has been a pain is that this computer gets very hot, and then overheats and shuts down. I have avoided this by avoiding soft surfaces and putting the computer in powersave mode. It generates much less heat that way. My girlfriend (who also wrote a review about this computer) has had multitudes of problems. I replaced her hard drive and reinstalled vista, and it runs much smoother now. She, however, has had her mouse buttons stick and trackpad go crazy. My trackpad only does this occasionally, so I can, and have lived with it.I have come to play the occasional game on my computer, and that did not end well. I started with Portal 1, and it ran it ok. It was very jittery and full of lag. I took a chance and bought Portal 2, hoping it wouldn't be much more taxing than the first. The only thing that runs ok sometimes is the start menu. If you are looking to play even occasional games, this is not near for you. At this point in time, this laptop would be a second-hand laptop. It has been quickly surpassed by other computers in its price range in a very  short amount of time. I am currently looking and saving for a new laptop.The things I do like are the keyboard and, surprisingly, Vista. With some maintenance and care, vista is not that bad. I prefer Vista's looks over 7's, but 7's functionality. I suppose I will get used to any keyboard that I use over a period of time, but this one seemed just right with good travel of the keys and not a bit of wear and tear yet. The touch sensitive buttons at the top are just an added bonus and have not failed me yet. The headphone port is another complaint I have. Dell has placed them right at the head of the hard drive, and thus, you can hear all the harddrive noise and even some fan noise through the headphones. I have pretty good headphones, and would really appreciate a quality, noise free output for them. I have ended up running most of my audio from a usb port out to a digital 8 channel mixer, then out to my speakers and headphones. This makes for a much cleaner sound when I am at my desk at home.All in all, I am about 4 star happy with its performance over the years, though I would not buy one again. There are many more laptops with greater quality at this price point. I would probably lean toward another manufacturer, in fact. Most likely one that starts with an H and ends with a P.","Date":"April 30, 2012"}
{"Title":"Dell Inspiron Mini review","Author":"John Brady","ReviewID":"R13ILGQB2CDGFZ","Overall":"good","Content":"This little netbook computer meets almost all of my wife's computing needs: it is light, small, has almost a full-size keyboard, a decently sized hard drive, a readable screen, and performs as advertised. The Wi-Fi adapter connects easily with our Verizon mobile hot spot for good, reliable, and consistent wireless connections. The biggest negative is that it comes with only the bare minimum memory -- 1GB -- needed to run the Windows 7 Starter edition pre-loaded on the computer. To make it more functionally usable, we upgraded the memory chip from 1GB to 2GB, which is the most memory the computer will take. To do that, we had to remove the keyboard -- aaargh. We also upgraded, online, from the Windows 7 Starter edition to the Windows 7 Ultimate edition. With the upgrade to 2GB memory, and to the do-everything Windows 7 Ultimate edition -- which includes multilingual capability -- we can write, send and receive e-mails in Japanese, and run other programs simultaneously. It is still considerably slower than larger laptops, however. To partially offset that, we loaded a 2GB SD card to give it ReadyBoost capability; doing that lets the computer use the additional flash memory the same as an additional memory chip. So, with a relatively cheap upgrade in memory and with a reasonably cheap upgrade to the Ultimate edition, the machine performs quite well for Web browsing, e-mailing, and use of Excel. It does not have a DVD/CD player, however. That may be overcome by using an add-on, plug-in third party USB drive. We have not yet had to use that capability, as we have downloaded all needed upgrades. Thus, in summation, we can recommend this computer if your needs do not include steaming video or significant graphics use. And, the price is right: you should be able to find this computer online for about $260 or so. That's it for us.","Date":"June 24, 2010"}

After about 6 months of just checking out different laptops, I was looking at the Sony Vaio CR series and did like it, but I also was looking at Toshiba. After collecting my graduation money, I started scanning the weekly ads for deals on laptops and found this one for only $500! The Vaio was going for $1100, so it was a no brainer which one I was going to get. I've been using it for close to three weeks now, and the only thing I have notice about the laptop is that the \"O\" key occasionally won't strike while you're typing, but pushing a little harder will fix the problem for a good while. Also, the \"Onyx Blue Metallic\" top does collect finger prints and smudges, but it's not really that bad.I've had my laptop for nearly a month.

This was my very first laptop, and it really isn't anything special. I always disliked how it didn't have a web cam and it wasn't all that great. This computer gets heated up VERY easily. The temperature will be super hot at most times, and the fan is always on, which can be annoying. The hard drive is very low, at 160 GB. I've had it for almost three years and I only have about 60 GB left. Which is decent I guess, because I'm the only one who uses it. My favorite part about this laptop is the keyboard. It's very easy to type on here, and the mouse pad works great. It also has a nicely sized screen at 15.6\" and the quality is standard. The screen could definitely be brighter, but its just fine. My model is older, so it doesnt have Windows 7, like I desire. All together this is a very simple computer, perfect for a younger age group and beginners.","Date":"February 22, 2011"}

Even running Vista, which most of my friends seem to hate. I use the laptop for work about 9 hours a day and it still works almost as well as new. Wireless seems to have good range compared to my older wireless cards. The Video playback far exceeds the video playback on my 2.8 ghz P4 Dell desktop. The only thing I don't like about it, is that the glare is pretty bad if you try to use it outdoors or in a car. But, the same can be said for 99% of the rest of the laptops out there, so it's a minor complaint. I used to do PC support for a living, and this is the most reliable computer (laptop or desktop) that I have ever owned.

I bought it a little over  4 months ago from Best Buy - $475... unreal.  Anyway, the twincore amd cpu is really nice to use, I can floor the cpu with one process, and it never seems to actually slow it down. Keep a rendering program active, and go checking email... works well.I didn't use Vista at all, rather I immediately upgraded to Linux Mint.  For those of you considering this laptop and linux, know that the wireless driver is not yet available for this machine.  It's so close, but it's been that way about 3 weeks now...  Anyway, all the other drivers work fine.  great machine.Somebody mentioned that they had a mouse jumping issue with it; they were using Vista, I'm glad to see that, because mine does it too.  However, since this is linux, I thought it was an incompatibility.  I've recently found that keeping my thumbs further away - not resting on the space bar really helps me -- seems the touchpad is pretty sensitive, so... keeping away from it is a good idea.  It's also very tap-sensitive, I've been inadvertently clicking on stuff.  Of course that's all controllable too.I don't use wireless that much, though I'll admit I'd be very pleased if it worked!  My laptop is a dekstop replacement as it's almost as powerful as my desktop.  The only area of concern is the single 5400 rpm drive.

I've contacted TOSHIBA service department for two issues and they have not been able to fix either one. Their standard answer is to \"do a system recovery.\" One problem is that the cursor jumps all over the screen and starts to insert letters where ever it pleases while typing. The patch driver they gave me was older than the one that came on the machine and did not work. Another problem is with Internet Explorer. It's constantly shuting down and doing an automatic restart for no apparent reason. Even though the software was OEM, they insisted that Microsoft was responsible, even though it clearly states in their warranty that TOSHIBA is responsible for all software that is factory installed. In short, TOSHIBA's service is worthless, unless all you want to do is a system recovery and lose everything you have on the PC. Who needs them for that?","Date":"September 3, 2008"}
{"Title":"Slim, Sexy, and Powerful... A True Classic","Author":"D. Truong \"El Duke\"","ReviewID":"R2S2X4J3OX95PE","Overall":"good","Content":"When it comes to computers, Dell has had a pretty good reputation for \"build quality\" in their products. But, they also have a reputation for notoriously bad \"customer service\".  One thing that I never expected from Dell was a laptop that was not only built well, but also a real \"head-turner\" . But that's exactly the case when it comes to the Dell M1330 laptop. This sleek and sexy 4 pound high-end (XPS line) laptop packs a formidable punch and offers a cool array of features & options. These features include an 13.3\" LED backlit screen (LED backlight optional), slot loading optical drive, brushed aluminum casing, biometric finger print reader (optional), Media player with travel remote (optional), integrated camera, HDMI out, Solid state hard drive 'SSHD' (optional),  and a good selection of laptop colors to choose from. To finish it off, it features powerful CPU choices ( from 1.66Ghz to 2.5Ghz \"Core 2 Duo\" Intel Processors) and an optional 128mb NVIDIA GeForce Graphics Card. But along with the good, there are a few things that keep this laptop from being perfect. One thing that I really wished this laptop had was more than just 2 USB ports. Not only that, but the ports are on opposite sides of the computer.  Also, there isn't even an option for buying an integrated Blu-ray drive... which doesn't make any sense when you see that there's a beautiful 13.3 wide-screen and HDMI port on this thing.Still, there's a lot to love about the Dell M1330. It's ultra portable/super thin wedge shape design, full-sized keyboard, and built-in memory card slot, integrated web-cam & mic, and 2 headphone jacks,  also adds to it's intrinsic value and charm. Few laptops can match both it's 'power per size' ratio. And although it's been available now for a couple years, it can still hold it's own among some of the newer laptops on the market.  And when it's all said and done, I think that it makes this Dell a true \"classic\"... especially now that Dell has discontinued this model. It can still be acquired \"new or used\" on sites like Ebay, through Dell's online Outlet store, and other online sources. It's also still available at some retail stores.Pros:-Beautiful glossy 13.3\" wide screen (also available with LED backlight)-Great super portable, sleek, light, and sexy design.-Powerful (up to 2.5GHz Core 2 Duo and 128mb NVIDIA GeForce Video Card option)-Nice array of colors available including \"Blue, Pink, White, Black, and Red\"-Slot Loading Optical drive-Wide array of hard drive options including SSHD, easy to DIY hard drive upgrade as well.Cons:-Only 2 USB drives-No Blu-ray Option-Standard 6-cell battery doesn't last too long (about 2 hrs) Don't even bother with 3-cell batt.-9 Cell battery available but it's very expensive and adds much bulk to laptop.(sticks out too)Conclusion:This is a sexy and powerful high-end ultra-portable laptop. I've heard that it was rated the most powerful laptop per it's size (when it was first released) ...But this may not be true anymore. The XPS line of Dell laptop has a higher build quality than most regular consumer laptops on the market. And because the prices for this model has drastically dropped (now that it's been discontinued), it's even more of a bargain. Mine has been very dependable and I'd highly recommend it to others.","Date":"October 1, 2009"}
{"Title":"Absolutly incredable for the price","Author":"Joshua Batchelor","ReviewID":"RDOVOKUD8IP7F","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a phenomenal laptop. I have had it for two months now and have only noticed one quirk and I believe that to be software related. As for the first negative review I am somewhat surprised as mine came with the reinstall DVD and the option of either having Vista 64 or 32 bit. There are some things on the partition but it is just the usual bloatware that you get on most retail PCs. I just formatted over it and use the extra HDD space. The only thing I wanted from it was the Lableflash software and you can easily get that online at various locations for free. All in all this is a great laptop with tons of features. One of my favorite things is that it has two HDD bays and unlike many other manufactures which would fill both with smaller drives to total the 320 gigs Gateway left the one slot empty for those who would wish to upgrade. From everything that I read they have done the same things for their processor and graphics card. Both can be removed and replaced. That was my one concern when purchasing this Laptop was the underpowered processor. However again that is easily replaced according to everything I read. In the end this is a highly upgradable laptop with a sweet case design and cost $800 less than the equivalent HP or Dell. I have not dealt with customer service but then again I am a geek and usually do all the repairs myself any way.P.S. Just for those that are curious about the HDMI and whether you can run the sound through it, yes you can. That was one of the question I could not find answered online.","Date":"October 10, 2008"}

I highly recommend this laptop for anyone that plays games or just wants to use it for basic computing.I purchased this laptop about a month ago.  My husband and I had looked around for a year or so before making our purchase.  When we saw this particular one, we were suprised at the price.  We paid $749 for it, and could not be happier.  You cannot get another laptop that even slightly compares to the spec's this one has in its price range.  It has run everything at exeptionally high frame rates.The battery life is not wonderful, but we have the cable and an adapter for our vehicle.  So that problem does not concern us.

{"Title":"Good Laptop","Author":"Barcelo","ReviewID":"R3OSH5WSNLPQOT","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this laptop for about three years. There are some down sides to it, but overall, if you care for it, it's a really good computer. The most inconvenient thing is probably the weight. This is a large (17\" screen), and heavy computer for a laptop. It is portable, but portability is limited by its weight. It can overheat very quickly, so this is not a computer you want to have sitting on your bed. Purchase an inexpensive laptop pad and there is no problem with overheating. Finally, if you leave this computer plugged in for extended periods, you can kill the battery (this is the case with pretty much any rechargeable battery). If you don't plan on carrying the computer back and forth a lot, you keep the computer on a solid surface so air can flow freely under and around it, and you don't leave it constantly plugged into the wall, this computer will last you for years. Just remembered one more negative, the color of the keys make it very difficult to see in low light. I can type by touch, so it's not a huge problem for me, but if you need to see the keys, it can be an issue.Some of the really good things about this computer is the processing speed. This is designed as a gaming computer, so it can render graphics very well and very quickly. This translates into not only a good gaming environment, but an excellent platform for watching movies. The speakers are very loud compared to other laptops I have owned, and paired with the 17\" screen, allow for an very good movie watching experience via DVD or over the internet. There is plenty of processor speed to multi task and have a movie playing in the background while you do other things (like surf the web, type a paper, etc.).One of my kids got to my computer and pulled most of the keys out, and the keys on this computer are not easy to replace once removed (but they are very difficult to remove in the first place). Along with that and the battery being practically dead, I figure it would cost less to just buy another one and switch the hard drive than it would be to repair the one I have, so I'm looking into purchasing a new laptop now.","Date":"June 6, 2012"}

This is subject to change.There are times the fan kicks on and the laptop becomes really hot.I have a great laptop stand for my MacBook by roadtools and it helps keep the heat away from me.One minor point: Heat does radiate out of the bottom left corner. Plus there is a slightly sharp ridge around the MacBook's edge. I find this ridge slightly irritating to the skin of my wrists.I wish Apple still had the MacBook in its lineup as it is a nice bridge between the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro.~~>> \"I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

I was a bit nervous after reading the reviews for the ibook G4, but decided to take a risk since it was an apple for $100.  It's great! Due to the processor being powerPC based (not intel duo), I decided to use the browser tenfourfox.  The internet speed is fine, and the pages load relatively quickly.  It's obviously not as fast as a brand new computer, but I can't believe how fast it is! So far I have been able to use it for everything I bought it to do.  I understand it's not good for gaming, or perhaps watching youtube.  That was not the basis for my decision as those were not things I needed.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs a laptop for school/internet useage.  It's been a great buy!I bought it from Technoid, and it is used but in very good shape.  Just some smudges and some scratches (barely).  The battery has lasted a long time on its first charge.

It won't download Firefox updates so I'm not sure if thats a software glitch or what.  Netflix wont work on the mini either.  It seems to be read as if its downloading to an ipod which it says when I attempt to download. Something Apple must've overlooked. Adobe or Flash(?) don't even ask!Ive had a G4 that I took the guts out of it so I know now first hand all the Mac has going for it is that its glorified IBM nothing more.

I could give it back for repair, but I can live with it. I cannot afford to lose more of my precious college time when I have to prepare a presentation for 35 people (I always can attach external DVD, may I need to) After all, it's 7 years old.- Although the bottom of the LCD case is loose, it does not interfere with my work on the iBook.-RAM is 768MB, not 1GB. I don't mind.- I got a cheap replacement adapter (on AMAZON for 8 dollars) in the box BUT it is long and way more comfortable that original APPLE charger- The battery was dead after half an hour but it's minor; I will use my old one from my broken Apple PowerBook if it will fit.Overall for 212.00 pretty good APPLE.","Date":"January 5, 2012"}

(I am still not quite ready to retire my tinier -- but heavier -- VGN-T250, which I really loved.)  I cannot say enough good things about this machine.  The screen is gorgeous.  The sound is really amazing from the speakers.  The webcam is a little tough to find but works very readily.  The fingerprint reader takes some getting used to (take the tutorial!) but what a great security measure.  And as for the machine itself, it is INCREDIBLY fast, and has one of the most comfortable keypads and most sensitive mouse pads I've ever used.  Did I mention how very light the laptop is, how elegantly thin the screen is, and how sensible Sony's power offerings (stamina or speed) are?  You do burn fast through the battery on \"speed\" setting but overall battery life is good even then, better than 2 hours.  I may pick up an extra battery in future just to have some extra juice when an outlet is far away, of course.  Anyway, I think this is a wonderful laptop for the road and frankly would be in the running for me as a desktop replacement.","Date":"January 9, 2009"}

I previously owned a Sony C1MVP Picturebook, Sony Vaio T350P, Sony Vaio SZ110P, Sony Vaio TXN15P, Sony Vaio TZ150N/B. This notebook is by far my favorite one. It has a nice industrial look to it with the brushed metal and keyboard. It very light for a 13.1 inch notebook only .5lbs heavier than my TZ150 I had before. The screen has 100% color saturation and is by far the best screen I ever seen, that coming from a previous owner of a TZ150. Its powerful and runs Vista without a hiccup. Keyboard is nice and responsive. Nice big trackpad and the buttons are not too loud when clicked. If I had a gripe it would be that it doesn't come with the XP downgrade CD as promised. Also the screen is kinda soft meaning it tilts easily back but not forward.","Date":"October 8, 2008"}
{"Title":"excellent all around laptop with some minor problem","Author":"CoopaPple","ReviewID":"R1B40GXE39PU5H","Overall":"good","Content":"When I first saw this laptop at local electronics store, I immediately knew that this is the laptop that I will be getting. Solid build, great look, light and powerful for such a small notebook. Although my laptop arrived with the express card slot flap messed up, it did not ruin my love for this lovely laptop. The monitor is super thin and covered in one material, the keyboard area is covered in a slippery albeit comfy metal feeling material, the bottom is composed of another kind of material and the battery is in its own kind. It sounds like a clump of non matching stuff, but they fit and the design is flawless. For such a small laptop, all the necessary ports are there (vga, 2 usb, ethernet, modem, express slot, wireless, sound i/o). The monitor is super bright if you turn it all the way up, which I doubt you will. It is clean and sharp, however it doesn't glare as bad as some other types of monitor. For the keyboard, I don't know if its my hand or what, but I tend to miss a few letters when typing which may come annoying but it happens rarely and most typing program catches typos for you.My main complaint would be that Sony's crapware really clogs up the system. For the more adventurous souls out there, if you have a stand alone copy of windows vista, WIPE THE SYSTEM AND REINSTALL! I guarantee you this beast will kill your average desktop. Sony's driver website provides all the important drivers in which one should have no problem when reinstalling. Windows 7 users might have some problems as I have yet to be able to get the fn adjust brightness keys to work.The hybrid graphic switch system is really great. It switches really fast and smooth. However as per the power that is saved.. I would say it only differs by about 30 to 50 minutes of work. I have yet to really get the battery to over 5 hours. Dont' know how they adjusted it but I've only managed about 4 hours with bluetooth wireless dvd drive off, and screen to lowest. The laptop under prolonged use does not get hot. Unlike other brands of laptop that just heats up like a stove, sony did a surprisingly incredible job on heat control and truly deserves your attention.My biggest gripe on this laptop will be on the battery however. The battery takes forever to charge from 80% to 100% and loses charge quickly from 100% to 80%. It took me 5 hours just to get from 90% to 100% one time, and while off, it lost 18% in 15 hours. So somehow, the battery likes to stay below.. 80% charge.Regardless, it is an excellent laptop. Excellent build quality and great design. It is incredible !","Date":"March 4, 2009"}

{"Title":"Great Laptop !!!","Author":"G. Coppola","ReviewID":"R2FFT6IW2FIQBY","Overall":"good","Content":"This computer was design for the business traveller person in mind. It's a very powerfull machine that can handle complex pogrames. The machine allows you to toggle between 2 graphic cards. Although it consumes more power, i use the NVIDIA dedicated graphic card when i want to hook up my 24 inches external monitor at my office. The 6 cell battery on POWER SAVER mode can last my 5-hour weekly flights and the computer is so small and compact that fits very comfortably on the plane seats front pockets. Surprisingly, the screen looks amazingly bright and sharp to view any graphics,in spite the slim screen. The computer doesn't come with any usefull free programs, so expect to install your own software, unless you proceed to purchase the pre-installed 30 day trial software already on the computer. The computer works great, my only criticism is that is an expensive product, so i reccommend everyone to purchase the 3 year warranty service plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies, Inc. offered at amazon.com that extends your computer to literally 4 years. I also reccommend buying the sony vaio neoprene sleeve for 13\" laptops to proctect the machine from scratches while travelling.","Date":"November 29, 2008"}

{"Title":"A great Machine at the end of the WindowsXP era--NOT!!!","Author":"Dr. Kent \"Dr Kent\"","ReviewID":"R6E2SA6EOG343","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this machine after a lot of research & consideration.  Mine came with he option to \"roll back\" to WindowsXP Professional AND the two DVDs to roll it back were included.  I would not have bought this machine without that option.  VISTA is a terrible opporating system!  But, still I had tons of crapware loaed up from SONY on their roll back DVDs to get rid of.  I wish SONY would not load up all that software by default.  However, the machine is very complicated and I like that SONY had the critical drivers on those XP roll back DVDs.  Had a better equipped machine been available for XP I would have bought it.  There is a lot to this little machine and it is FAST, at least with XP.  But there is a lot to be desired.  For one, the default SONY settings don;t even set up the software to address and take advantage of that huge 6 MB of L2 cache.  For another, by default, the DDR3 RAM is set to run at a lower speed.  Also, I find the instructions, guidelines and recommendations for battery charging & care to be confusing.  Otherwise I would give this machine a 5-star rating.  SONY has a very slow loading website and SONY does not allow users much in the way of options when configuring a notebook.  If I didn't need this fast processor with its huge L2 cache for voice recognition, I would have bought something at half the price with more standard warranty coverage, better support and a lot less crapware.  SONY needs to listen to its customers and give us what we want rather than dictate to us, especially when they want so much money for on of these!UPDATE & WARNING April 18, 2009:While this machine is advertised as having DDR3 RAM that operates at 1066 MHz, the truth is it ONLY operates at a paltry 800 MHz under WindowsXP Professional.  While SONY claims to be working on a fix, be advised SONY has not produced a fix for their SONY VAIO Control Center which appears to be malfunctioning since February when I first contacted SONY for tech support.Moreover, SONY blamed this on Microsoft Window's XP operating system!  Heck, shouldn't SONY test & know these things in advance since they design & build them?[...]","Date":"March 8, 2009"}

It initially came with Windows Vista, but I upgraded it to Windows 7 professional with no problem. I haven't had any problems with my DVD drive. Never had a blue screen or any sort of malfunction. I like to do a lot of customization so I have rainmeter running on it, rocketdock and a host of other application that run at startup and my toshiba hums along with no issues. I like that I can log in to my computer just by scanning any finger with the Biometric scanner on the lower right side of the keyboard area.It has 4 USB ports which is great. I'm using them all simultaneously right now without a hiccup. I use an additional monitor connected through a VGA port, but it also has a Svideo port and I've hooked it up to my tv, several times. The wifi on it is great. My router is in the office, one floor up and I've never had a problem connecting or losing signal.I have a desktop that I hardly use because this laptop does a great job. Even though I haven't, putting more memory in would make this laptop perfect. It comes with 1GB of RAM, running at 1.73Ghz (Faster than some laptops currently produced).The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm stingy. I might have given it five stars if it had an HDMI port, but when this computer was produced, very few laptops would have come with a HDMI port. I can't say enough about this laptop.

To be completely honest, I love it. (I would recommend it.) The keyboard is awesome, the flat low keys make typing very easy and smooth. I use this computer for college (writing a LOT) and since I don't have TV I use it for watching movies etc. I also play Fallout 3 on it and it performs great, great picture quality compared to my old pixilated screen. I love the color/design, but it gets fingerprints on it easily...that just gives me an excuse to clean it more often which I should probably be doing anyway. I have had an issue with the volume not working suddenly (only has happened 3 times, I literally use this laptop 10+ more hours a day, almost everyday) but when I restart the computer it always works fine so I don't see it as being too much of a problem. Also, there is no external volume, you have to actually use the mouse to open the icon on the screen. Overall, despite these little errs, it's definitely worth the price. I paid only 800.00 for mine.

With the new 25w mobile cpu (P8400 in my case) it runs cool enough to not need an additional platform cooler while on your lap (it doesn't blow hot air either).  From the first reports they must have repositioned the Thinklight because my doesn't blind me (it's inside the bezel more now I think).  You might want to download the additional Keyboard Customizer program from Lenovo to disable the forward and back web keys that are next to the Up arrow.  I kept pressing them by mistake and causing all kinds of problems.Pros: Thinklight. pointer mouse (hate those aweful touchpads! disabled mine). thin and light. Great battery life even with just 6 cell.  Single latch switch. Cool running cpu. Bought through Ebay (ellan_mouse) for only $750 after 10% ebay discount with no tax or shipping charges (now that's a deal!). Keyboard feels the same (not flexy like other reports). XP Pro still available.Cons: Screen off to the right, widescreen (I like tall more than wide), lcd screen not the brightest and bad off angle viewing (might be good for security and keeping peepers away though). Had to install program to disable keyboard buttons (forward/back web page buttons).  Speakers sound tiny. I don't know if it's my Airlink 150N router but I'm only getting 72Mb top speed from its 5100N wireless. Not as easy to add memory as older units (must remove keyboard bezel now).Seems like a lot of Cons but at this price I am not complaining.  I have a huge home system so my T400 is just a stripped down unit with XP Pro (not whista), only 1 gb of memory (everything running uses less than 700 Mb), intel video, dvd only reader (I use flash drives and only burn dvds on my home unit).  Didn't make sense to pay another $300 for options (video, burner) that my home unit can do better and faster.  I still use the T400 way more at home for doing most things.  I just got the T400 so I don't know if it will last as long as my old T22 has (still running when I sold it) but I hope so!

ThinkPads have been the top of the line laptops for IBM and now Lenovo. I bought this for half the price of what a MacBook Pro costs and performed some easy installation upgrades such as Solid State drive and 8GB of Ram. With a Macbook you have to do a bit more work just to perform these tedious upgrades (Apple doesn't like it when you open up their products).This Laptop is lightning fast, the keyboard is a joy to type on, speakers are great, webcam view is clear and the very cool thing about this laptop is the Ultra bay hot swap. If you don't use the CD/DVD recordable drive as much, you can easily eject it by pressing the Ultra bay eject tab and insert an additional battery or an extra hard drive for backups. This feature is very very cool and you can't do that on a MacBook Pro!Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit runs flawlessly (thanks to Microsoft)and by far is the best Windows version Microsoft has ever built. The BitLocker encryption is a plus which allows you to encrypt USB, SD cards, folders, files or the hard drive itself for extra protection. But if you want security, this laptop has another cool feature..it has an accurate fingerprint reader that allows you to associate any finger with your password(s). In other words, no more typing passwords to log into Windows. When you boot up your laptop, it prompts you to swipe your finger and presto! Without the finger swipe, no thief or intruder can wipe or access or remove your hard drive without that finger print. You can't do that on a Macbook Pro!!Finally, I love the so called rollcage technology (durable frame inside)that guards it from those accidental drops. It also has a cool drain technology for those accidental spills...you can't do that on Macbook Pro!So do yourself a favor, if want want more bang for your buck with all these extra goodies and performance, get a ThinkPad! I also highly recommend uninstalling any Lenovo software you may not want to use just to free up some space. I only use Lenovo update software, Fingerprint and Power Manager.  Those are all you need!$1600 for top of the line ThinkPad with goodies vs. $2200 for a Macbook Pro (without SSD or 8GB Ram)....the choice is obvious!","Date":"March 10, 2012"}

It also has a 160 GB HDD instead of 80 GB, so I'm more than happy with the substitution. I expected the battery would be weak, but it still had more than 86% of its capacity so it will be good for a while. I was planning to upgrade the HDD, but now I don't need to, and I've never needed 4 USB ports - so it's all good.It was shipped very promptly, and was well packed with 3 layers of bubble wrap for protection. It's in excellent condition, everything works fine. I have nothing but praise for the vendor.These Thinkpad T400s are really nice. Good solid metal case with strong metal hinges - the screen stays at the angle you put it. I has good wide viewing angles side-to-side, less so up-and-down, and the image is very crisp. The keyboard is great, I wish I had one as nice on my desktop. It never gets hot - if it's really pushed hard, noticeably warm air blows out of the vents, but nothing uncomfortably hot. Easy to work on, too - if I decide to add more RAM just need to take off the palm rest, held on by 4 screws, to get at it. The optical drive pops out and can be hot-swapped with other accessories - even another HD.I love this thing. I feel like I got a really great deal.","Date":"October 28, 2012"}

{"Title":"Good solid machine","Author":"Pamela Y. Swartz \"book lover\"","ReviewID":"R1X8M6VUYEC49W","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first purchase of a renovated product and I was very favorably impressed. The machine's battery does not hold its charge like I thought it would. This is no discredit to the seller, however.  And do keep in mind that this is a refurbished model. Although, shouldn't they work a little better than this?The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, is : Although I do love the size and shape of the keys, when typing, the cursor jumps up to a previous line every second or third sentence unless you type extremely slow. And I mean slow.Then, there you are typing away when it isn't even on the sentence you were typing on.  I thought it might be the mouse pad, but I have been unable to find out how to disable it and use a Bluetooth mouse.Which brings up my second complaint...no manual anywhere. You would think that a laptop that is only two years old would have a manual somewhere online. I called Lenovo and a rep. said they didn't have one, and acted like I was putting him out by asking him to answer a couple of questions about it.  Too bad.  I thought I might buy a new Lenovo ThinkPad, but if that represents their customer service, I may rethink my decision.","Date":"April 10, 2013"}

I use it for my photography work with photoshop, netflix, skype conferencing, managing my music library and android walkman. it burns both cds and dvds, has vga out for hooking to a monitor or projector. has thinklight for typing in the dark. durable plastic composite body amd stainless steel hinges show it can take abuse.i am overall happy with my purchase, and would recommend this to friends.","Date":"December 27, 2012"}

{"Title":"Excellent, better than expected!!!","Author":"Aloosh","ReviewID":"R2RQ6J4CZ0GFMA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this item used and it came without scratches and no dead pixels. Also there was not a single issue with the laptop. Surely I will buy again from the same buyer.I have Sony, Acer, HP, Toshiba and IBM laptops. Bought the IBM because it had lived with me for more than 16 years and the only issue was the battery (which is very normal). Yes 16 years this is how much it is reliable.My T400 was much better than I expected which I bought for 299 US. The anti-glare screen makes a huge difference for the comfort of the eyes. Also, mine has no camera which is very good for offshore trips and missions since laptops with cameras are forbidden. The keyboard is fantastic, comfy and easy to use the best I ever seen and used. My T400 came with Windows XP PRO which I like more than Windows 7. In terms of speed I think I got more than enough and its pretty fast. Battery is like 4 hours with normal internet usage which is better than any of my other laptops. Remember, its a used laptop!All in all it was the first time I think I had a steal bargain in amazon. The T400 is very solid and reliable. If it was possible to rate this as a 6 star out of 5 then I wont hesitate. Also see in youtube the military tests made on the thinkpads. My next laptop if I need one will surely be a thinkpad. This is how laptops should be built and designed.","Date":"November 4, 2011"}

Sufficient to say that this laptop has not only endured over 4 years of use, but has also been used a good hour or 2 a day. Of course, keeping a machine like this in working order doesn't come easy, from running virus scans to maintaining the drive (space content). Aside from this, what I am most impressed about is the way this model was built. Though Lenovo laptops are known to be built to last, when I purchased this laptop, I was a bit hesitant due to the revised keyboard. It didn't seem as sturdy as earlier models. Was I wrong! It has taken a beating and keeps on going. Definitely will be purchasing another Lenovo when I am ready to upgrade.","Date":"March 11, 2014"}

The wi-fi is keeping me connected as I'm typing this from a hotel room. The processor is nice and fast. There are four high-speed USB connections. The unit is solidly built (perhaps a mite heavy).My only criticisms are as follows:The screen resolution doesn't look quite as sharp as on my desktop monitor. I'd say, maybe 85% as sharp, so it's usually barely noticeable. The other thing is that the soundcard doesn't have all the mixer capabilities you might expect to find in a desktop. I don't know if this is common in laptops and I sort of stumbled upon the issue. But I got around it by purchasing an external mixer from the Guitar Center.I initially intended it only as a travel companion but have since begun using it in my recording studio (with Cakewalk Music Creator). Oh, and to play SimCity (which doesn't work on Vista!) All in all, I am quite satisfied with it.The seller shipped it out immediately and it arrived by FedEx or UPS (I forget which) in a matter of days (two or three, as I recall -- it was quick).","Date":"September 11, 2009"}

It even has all the microsoft office applications for school or projects.

Webcams, gaming apps, blah blah, weren't a factor.  I upgraded the g-wireless to g/n with an adapter no problem.  Had some issues with the speaker hardware, but fixed it with ms-support software I found on the internet.  Every now & then the 'net gets really, really lagging, but a reboot tends to solve it.  Again, it's been rebuilt; it's a little rickety in its construction, and it's an old model.  But the problems have been minor, and I am knowledgable enough to know where to go online for answers.

Our advice is to turn it on, uninstall whatever virus software is on there and immediately install FROM A DISC either Norton Internet Security or Avast Internet Security or something even more powerful and run it on the entire system to clean it up before you do anything else on it. You might also consider, once that's done, taking it to a serious tech person who can make sure it's not running any spyware your security system didn't catch.

{"Title":"Good, Durable Afforable Laptop","Author":"V Rajan","ReviewID":"RU1714OANC65J","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this laptop for just $850 in 2009. Over the last 3+ years, I have taken on trips, meetings, airports, buses and just about everywhere and it still keeps ticking as reliably as ever. I've spilt ice water on it by accident, left it running in the backpack, dropped it a few times onto the floor from the table and couch. Yet, I have never once had a hardware issue, be it faulty screens, touchpad, mic, camera or speakers. I've owned Acers, Dells (ugh), HPs, Compaqs, Macbooks and Toshiba laptops over the last 12 years. This is by far the single best laptop I've owned to date.The other reviews on the web will complain about this laptop's build quality. That is a fair point, BUT ONLY when comparing it other thinkpads or the macbook. The low price of this laptop means that it does not have the magnesium alloy roll cage and hinges which give Thinkpads their brick like hardness. But when comparing it to any other laptop on the market, the build quality is one cut above. Even with a plastic case, there is no flex on this laptop. You can try to bend it and it won't budge. Even after thousands of openings and closings, the lid hinges snap perfectly shut.The keyboard is good enough to deserve a review of its own. Many thinkpad users have told me about the awesomeness of a Thinkpad keyboard. I thought it an exagerration until I used this laptop. I am now sold. The Thinkpad Island keyboard is arguably the best laptop keyboard I've ever used and possibly even rivals several desktop keyboards. Unfortunately, Lenovo has recently changed this famous keyboard and replaced it with a chiclet design on newer laptops. While most reviewers don't see this as a problem, Thinkpad diehards still believe that the Island keyboard of old is the best.There is only one downside with this laptop, as with any Thinkpad. It won't die. After 3+ years, this laptop still looks and works like the day it was bought. The hardware inside has become outdated and while it runs Windows 7 without any issues, I can see it struggling to run future OSes. I have spent about $200 to perform some minor upgrades, by increasing the RAM to 4GB and replacing the hard drive with an SSD. I can see this laptop easily running for another 3 or more years, with occasional formats and OS reinstalls.Thinkpad diehards will complain about the glossy finish and the recessed ports on this laptop, but both are frankly minor issues, if at all. Highly recommend this laptop or any Thinkpad of a similar size.","Date":"October 1, 2012"}

I have always love IBM Thinkpad and Lenovo does not seem to have not diminished the quality. Keep in mind that this laptop is a few years old, but within a few days I found I had a hard drive problem, I could hear the hard drive head clicking which if you know anything about computers it meant that my hard drive would eventually die. I did an Image backup of the T400, in fact I made 4 different Image backup. I am a bit cautious when it come to ability to restore my system in case of a crash. After doing the backup I replaced the hard drive and started the backup which did not go well. The image I made on my DVDs did not auto run on start up. After a day or two of banging my head and thinking I would have to purchase another copy of Windows I did an internet search and found I need an installation disk to get the image recovery started. I had a Windows 7 upgrade disk from another computer and use it to access the Recovery console at start up. From there I was able to install my saved image back onto the T400. Now I have the same Windows that came with my system but on a larger hard drive. As I said, this system is older and no seller can guarantee the life of a hard drive so this was an inconvenience and I did have install a new hard drive but the T400 is perfect machine.

{"Title":"I switched to Mac and all I got was this stupid smile","Author":"Julia","ReviewID":"R3LSRN96Y69UAH","Overall":"good","Content":"I upgraded to a new Vista laptop last year, and have been unhappy and frustrated with it from the start.  When my daughter's laptop died a horrible death, I really didn't want to go through the same Vista pains with her, so I decided to replace it with a Mac (it's going to be a Christmas present, so shhh!).  As designated tech support for my family and friends, I started learning everything I could about Mac before she started asking questions.  The more I learned about it, the more I wanted one for myself, and now that I have one, I am really kicking myself for not switching last year.It's simply beautiful.  I know it sounds like I drank the apple-flavored Kool-Aid, but the Macbook really is a marvel of elegant form and function.  It feels solid and substantial, without being bulky and heavy.  the aluminum design is a work of art, and I really appreciate all of the eco-friendly choices that were made regarding the components.The LED screen is brighter and clearer than my old laptop's LCD screen.  Looking at them side by side, the difference is amazing (and my old laptop was marketed as a portable entertainment PC, with an upgraded screen).  I don't know what kind of LCD screens some of the other users have, but the Macbook screen is far superior to any notebook screen I've ever seen.The back-lit keyboard is great - no more keyboard light needed. The keys have a solid feel to them, they're not mushy or noisy like some keyboards can be, they're just right, and the key layout is just like a full-size keyboard - no more hunting to figure out where the heck the backslash key is hidden or hitting the wrong key because your pinky slipped off of an undersized shift key.I'll admit that I couldn't figure out the trackpad at first, but I felt like a dork once I realized how simple it is.  I did change the settings so that I can tap to click in addition to pressing down on the trackpad (since that's what I'm used to).  It's just incredibly easy once you get going.  Swipe two fingers down the pad to scroll, swipe four for expose, tap with two fingers for secondary-click... it does more straight out of the box than my old highly-programed touch-pad.  And after about an hour, the gestures become second-nature.As far as the built-in speakers go, they're nicer than I expected, especially since I can't figure out how the heck they fit any speakers into such a tiny case.  Seriously, it's like the whole case is the speaker.  As I type this review, I'm listening to the album Paradise Lost by Symphony X and It sounds pretty good to me.  of course, it sounds even better played through my Klipsch Room Groove, but um.. hey... they're integrated laptop speakers - though they are very nice ones.There are only two USB ports, but since the keyboard and trackpad are so functional, you won't need external input devices (though a number pad is a must for me when doing a lot of data-entry).  I only use USB for external storage and synching my iPod, so it's not a problem for me (my iPod touch has a program that lets it act like a number pad when I need one).  If I ever need more devices at once, I'll get a USB hub.Now, it's confession time:  As a Windows-centric IT Professional, I never liked Apple much, and I spent many years making fun of Mac and Mac users.  When OS X came out, I couldn't justify further ridicule, so I just ignored Mac whenever the subject came up.  After using Leopard for a short time, I can tell you that I don't have the appetite to eat the big heaping serving of humble pie that I'm owed.  Leopard is slick and smooth and oh so fast.  I'm truly enamored with iLife and iWork, and Time Machine is just about perfect (better than shadow copies, for the Windows guys and gals).  It's packed with a lot of little things (like Spotlight and Preview) that are unobtrusive and helpful, which is a vast improvement over Vista's annoying and unhelpful features.So, now I'm a happy convert.  I still have two programs that are Windows-only (until I find replacements), and I still go back to my old (1 year old) laptop occasionally (for just the two, I don't want to bother with Boot Camp or Parallels).  I hate going back to Vista after using my Macbook.  Even though that laptop technically has higher RAM and processor specs than the Macbook, it's slow and clunky in comparison.  I always sigh in relief when I can put it away again.Bottom line:  I love my Macbook and I wish I hadn't waited so long to make the switch.  If you're worried about switching to Mac, visit an Apple Store - even if you have to make a day trip to get there, it will be worth it.  Spend a little hands on time with the Macbook, and check out all the free classes the store offers.  If you buy from the store, they will move your files from your old PC for you (for free).  If all of that doesn't convince you, then come see me, and I'll offer you a tall, refreshing glass of Apple-flavored Kool-Aid. :-)","Date":"December 18, 2008"}
{"Title":"Phenomenal Laptop","Author":"Mia Chong","ReviewID":"R2XIJXRL7B6UQE","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: - GREAT OS- Lightning fast- Light-weight, sturdy unibody design- Attractive design- Dashboard- Incredible screen- Great trackpad- Good battery life- Keyboard is excellent- Magsafe adapter- Excellent iSight Camera- Boot camp availableCons: - Glossy screen quite reflective- Screen is fingerprint prone- No FireWire- Small amount of game functionality- Battery not as good as advertised- Distant longing for physical trackpad button- Multi-touch gestures not entirely spot-onSummary: The new Macbook. It's incredible. With faults. That's all I'm going to say for my introduction. Read on.Physical SpecsThe product physically is very sturdy, thanks to the unibody construction. Normally the chassis would normally consist of various small parts. So instead of taking a small piece of aluminum and adding more aluminum, Apple has taking a big piece of aluminum and subtracted from it. Thus creating a sturdy, yet light laptop. I have heard that the aluminum interferes with internet connectivity issues. I do have to say, unfortunately, it is true. I put the Macbook and my old PC laptop side by side, and the PC was able to pick up better frequency and more networks.Now for the multi-touch trackpad. It is made from glass, but it feels like there is a covering on it that doesn't nearly have the friction of glass. Clicking and moving the cursor is very easy and enjoyable, with the very large surface. Right-clicking can be done with by clicking with two fingers or by clicking one of the bottom corners after being manually set. It should also be noted that only the bottom 3/4 of the trackpad is clickable.The multi-touch gestures are fun to use, but are truly unneeded gimmicks that could be done easier with a click.I'll just go through the gestures now.There are 2 finger gestures:The first is scrolling with using two fingers by swiping your fingers vertically or horizontally depending on the page.Secondly you can rotate a picture using two fingers apart and rotating.The third gesture is holding the control button and scrolling vertically to zoom in on a page.And there is one 3-finger gesture:Swipe with three fingers to navigate. You can do this to go forward or back on a page, or changing a picture.Lastly there are 4-finger gestures:Swiping vertically upwards allows you to clear everything off your desktop.Swiping vertically down launches Expose.Swiping horizontally in any direction lets you change and view your running applications, which can also be done with command+tab.On the bottom of the MacBook there is a panel that allows for easy access to your battery and hard drive. This will be handy to many people.The keyboard is just like the Air, with the spaces between the keys. This creates a very nice typing experience, and are backlit if you purchase the 2.4GHz model.A major letdown by Apple is the omission of a FireWire port. This is very disappointing to many people, but doesn't affect me at all. Nowadays the average users don't use FireWire too much. Although I do see this as a major problem for professional applications.There is also a battery life indicator on the side of the base that glows green to show the rounded percentage of your battery.Software and PerformanceOf course the MacBook has the great Mac OS X Leopard software.It is very fast, and has good security.The battery life is advertised to have 5 hours of battery life, but Apple obviously means not being connected to the Internet, and having no applications running. You'll probably get about 4 and a half hours with Safari and other apps running. Unless you have a lot of apps on like me, then you'll maybe have 3 and a half to 4 hours.With the NVidia graphics card, the screen looks pretty good, as do games. I do have to admit, though, the new MacBook Pro screen looks better, especially with blacks. Still, games really pop on the gorgeous glossy screen, unless you are in a bright area. The glossy screen of course attracts bad glares and many noticeable fingerprints. Still, if you are indoors or someplace with low light, the glossy screen is perfect. I mostly use it inside, so I wouldn't trade the beautiful glossy screen. Although for those coffee-shop typing folks, this could be a deal-breaker.Other than these things, Mac OS X is the same, really.ConclusionIf you have purchased a MacBook anytime soon, then I would not suggest you purchase this one. Most of the differences are the physical attributes, and the software is pretty much the same.If you are new to Macs like me, then I would DEFINITELY suggest this phenomenal notebook computer. Of course it does have it's faults, truly I have never used such a simple, enjoyable computer.","Date":"October 23, 2008"}
{"Title":"The definitive new laptop experience","Author":"J. D. Walters \"Heyzeus7\"","ReviewID":"R2WH4TMDLVFXLR","Overall":"good","Content":"(Disclaimers: I am not an IT professional so I cannot judge the Macbook's performance based on any technical standards such as benchmark CPU tests, etc. Also, I got the machine, AppleCare and full software suite at a student discount from my university's laptop program, which I take for granted.)My first college laptop was a Dell Latitude D610. It was a fantastic machine for its price, doing everything I needed it to do. But recently I heard that PC laptops are only expected to last around 4 years before giving out, so I decided to take advantage of my school's discount program and buy a new laptop before I graduated. A tech supervisor I talked to sold me on the superior quality and durability of the Macbook, and when I saw the new line of Aluminum Macbooks on the Apple site I decided after a lot of research and thought to go for it. It arrived December 1 and I've been using it ever since.All I can say is that switching from PC to Mac has been a revelation. The new Macbook is the most impressive laptop I have ever seen. It is supremely easy to use, with a much more attractive, centralized software handling experience than Windows. Below I give a brief summary of how my computing experience has changed for the better since making the switch to Mac.-Portability: my Dell laptop was portable, but it was also bulky, heavy, and seemed fragile when I carried it in one hand. The new Macbook is slim, light and incredibly sturdy. For the first time I feel comfortable with taking my laptop everywhere, from taking notes in class to working on a paper at the library or dining hall. I bought a Kensington Contour Cargo Notebook Messenger to carry it in and it has enough space for everything I need to carry during my school day, including my laptop. I now have the complete portable college computing experience.-Speed: I didn't take my Dell laptop out of my room very often because it was very slow to 'wake up' from sleep mode. The new Macbook both sleeps and wakes on the drop of a dime, making it a true notebook, i.e. a machine that you can jot something down on whenever you feel the need. That combined with its portability makes it the perfect mobile computing platform.-Operating System: the Mac OS X Version 10.5.4 Leopardis a much, more more attractive, efficient operating system than Windows. The user interface is more intuitive, more customizable and more centralized. Even though I've used Windows all my life (I can remember all the way back to Windows 3.1, 95, 98, 2000 and XP) I already much prefer the Dock to the Start icon, the Finder to Windows Explorer and the automatic appearance of peripherals on the Desktop instead of the bubble 'New Hardware Found' option in Windows. Everything about the Mac OS X just works better. And now that the Mac is becoming increasingly compatible with Windows suites such as Office and Adobe, there's no excuse to hold on to Windows.-Trackpad: I don't own an iPhone or iPod touch, so I only just discovered the magic of multi-finger gestures with the new Macbook's trackpad, and I am hooked. I just love the two-finger scroll option, and the four-finger Eclipse function is something from the future. I use it all the time when working on a paper and I need to quickly look up an article or dictionary online, while at the same time checking my email or playing albums on Youtube or iTunes. I don't use a conventional mouse anymore, except for playing RPGs. Trust me. The new trackpad is just that awesome.-Screen: my Dell had a matte screen with good resolution for what it had to do. But the new Macbook glossy screen is absolutely gorgeous for watching movies or any other multi-media function. The picture is brighter, sharper and clearer. Users perhaps have a point that the viewing angle is small, but the only problem I've had when watching movies or using other applications is when I put my face down on the desk as I'm working, and I doubt many people use a laptop from that position. The picture is sharp and clear even from 'over-the-shoulder' angles from quite far away. Where the screen really shines, though, is with HD video. I watched remastered Star Trek episodes on CBS and it was a dream, along with HD trailers from the Apple website. If you're thinking of getting a Macbook, don't listen to people who say that the screen is terrible. It's not terrible. It might not satisfy the ultra-purists but for ordinary users the difference in quality is probably not noticeable. What IS noticeable is the difference in quality between a PC matte screen and the new Apple LED-backlit glossy screen that adjusts for ambient light. A final word about reflectiveness: the glossy screen is quite reflective, it's true. But the screen is bright enough to overshadow the reflections in all circumstances I've used it in, including outdoors in bright sunlight. Also, for me at least the reflections are like gestalt psychology: I can focus on the screen or on the reflections but not both at the same time.-Keyboard: this will vary with people's preference, but I just love Apple's chicklet keyboard. I'm a fast typer and the easy depression and the crisp 'click' sound the keys make somehow just feels right. I feel more productive when I'm using a chicklet, don't ask me why. For me at least the advertisements were right: it is a better typing experience than the standard PC keyboard.-Peripherals: I don't use any Firewire devices so the lack of a Firewire port has never been a problem for me. I never use more than two USB devices at a time anyway so the Macbook's two USB ports is just right for me. The only problem I have with the new Macbook as far as peripherals are concerned (and one of the only problems I have with the new Macbook period) is the lack of any way to connect with a standard AV/Composite input TV. The only media output peripheral is the new MiniDisplay port which with the right adapter can link with DVI, HDMI or digital VGA but not S-video. There's NO way to get around this, believe me I've tried. No combination of adapters will do the trick. This is kind of a bummer because I've become accustomed to watching Netflix Instant Viewing titles on an old Acer 27\" TV I bought for 50 bucks. Those days are gone. But I'm selling the TV when I graduate in the spring, and by the time I get a new one it will probably an HDTV like Samsung LNS3251D 32-Inch LCD HDTV, so it won't matter anyway.-Software: I can pretty much guarantee you that for any kind of application available in Windows, the Apple version is better. Safari is a far better web browser than Internet Explorer (although the free Mozilla Firefox is better than Safari), Apple Mail along with iCal beats Outlook by a country mile, iTunes is much better than Windows Media Player, etc. I even prefer the Apple version of Microsoft Office to the Windows version for its ease of use, appealing graphic user interface, etc. That combined with the overall superior Mac operating system makes for a much more sophisticated, delightful computing experience. It's fast and reliable. And when you think of other Apple applications with no obvious counterpart in Windows like iWeb, there's really no good reason not to switch to the Macbook.-Compatibility: so far the only compatibility issue I've had with PC vs Mac is Netflix Instant Viewing. For a long time you had to have Internet Explorer to watch their catalog online. All that has changed now with Netflix's adoption of their new Silverlight based Instant Viewing player. Now Intel Mac users (and the new Macbook has an Intel Duo processor, see the tech specs) can watch the whole Netflix catalog online, and it's faster and more efficient than before. The picture seems to be a bit grainier than with the other player, but I imagine that will change. Printers, USB cameras, flash drives, etc. all work just fine with the new Macbook.I could go on about all the reasons I love my new Macbook, such as the ability to link up with the iTunes playlists of other Macbooks and listen to other people's music, the long battery life, etc. but for now I'll conclude by saying that I am completely satisfied with my new toy. It does everything I need it to do and more. Ignore the naysayers, there's no such thing as a perfect product. Everyone will find something to gripe about. I think it was worth every penny and will serve you very well for years to come.P.S. If you're making the switch from PC to Mac I strongly suggest buying or borrowing David Pogue's Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Leopard Edition. It will make the transition smooth and quick and you'll instantly have all the formidable potential of your new Macbook at your fingertips.","Date":"December 23, 2008"}
{"Title":"First time Mac user loves the Macbook","Author":"Mermaid","ReviewID":"R1KVHHEDTRQ1X8","Overall":"good","Content":"My husband decided a laptop computer would be my anniversary/Christmas gift this year and he suggested I take a look at the Macbook because of all the photography and other artistic things I like to do on the computer.I read the reviews on Amazon and it seemed to me either the reviewer loved it and made no mention of \"firewire\" - something I had never heard of - or the reviewer gave negative reviews and was mentioning \"firewire\" or the lack thereof in the new MacBook.After my online research we went to our local Apple store to talk to a MacNerd in person and see the MacBook live and in action.  The techy was super knowledgeable, didn't talk techy, and helped me figure out exactly what I needed from my computer.  He didn't upsell me at all.  I asked him about this \"firewire\" and essentially it boiled down to the fact that I didn't care or need firewire as all it was is that previous Macs had it so that you could hook your computer up to another Mac with this technology and basically move files/applications from one computer to another without a hitch.  Given that I didn't have another Mac nor had I ever executed such a task, I wasn't worried about the lack of firewire.I ended up with what I called the \"entry level\" Macbook...the one with 160GB, as I already have a 500 GB external hard drive that is fortunately compatible with both my PC desktop and my new Mac (a MyBook).  I got a free printer/scanner all-in-one (after rebate), and I also purchased the Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel software as I just couldn't let go of that.  I felt that the iPhoto software that comes with the MacBook was sufficient and if for some reason I needed more I could just use the photo imaging software that I have on my desktop (or always upgrade to Aperature if I felt the need).  I also got a cool, snazzy little laptop bag.  I was nervous that I would not acclimate to the touchpad, so we also purchased a wireless mouse.  After everything was said in done, we spent $1800, but will be getting a $100 rebate check in the mail for the printer/scanner, so it will end up being $1700.Since yesterday I've fiddled around and played with the new features and have been exploring in my MacBook.  I haven't even opened my wireless mouse packaging yet --- my first frustration was not properly figuring out how to scroll with my touchpad or \"right click\" - a quick search on Apple's website under the Support menu helped me figure those out.  I might end up returning the wireless mouse after all.The battery so far is good and the first charge went pretty fast!I've had zero problems with the display being too reflective.  I've used it with a dark wall behind me as well as a big sliding glass door with lots of natural light and again, there was no problem at all.  I haven't had to adjust my color/contrast settings at all, so whatever it was set to \"out of the box\" has been perfect.  The only time there is a glare from the natural light was when I stopped using the MacBook a few minutes and it went \"idle\" as the screen darkens a bit which reflected the light a lot.  As soon as I began using it again, though, the brightness went right back to normal and I saw perfectly.My guilty pleasure right now is playing with the built in camera and putting funky backgrounds behind me where I get to pretend I'm at a beach, in Paris, or up floating with some clouds in the sky!  My kids get a kick out of sitting on my lap in front of the MacBook and turning the background into a roller coaster.  The background actually moves so it appears we're sitting in a roller coaster seat!Granted I've had my new toy for less than 24 hours, but I couldn't be happier with the purchase!","Date":"November 23, 2008"}

I enjoyed using my white plastic MacBook, but when I learned about the manufacturing process used to construct the new aluminum MacBook, I realized it was time for an upgrade!I have read the unenthusiastic reviews despairing the removal of a Firewire port in the aluminum MacBook. I certainly understand that to some people Firewire connectivity is essential. I am not one of those people. I have never used the Firewire port in my white plastic MacBook. I guess I'm just behind the times; I don't even own a video camera.I have also read the negative comments about the glossy screen. I like the glossy screen because everything looks a little sharper as compared to the matte screen of my white plastic MacBook.The new MacBook has a glorious aluminum case and the computer is significantly faster than my 1.83Ghz 2gb RAM white plastic MacBook.This machine is a winner..","Date":"November 4, 2008"}
{"Title":"firewire / other thoughts","Author":"matblinks","ReviewID":"RM2M67IE4H7PM","Overall":"good","Content":"*edit* this was not supposed to be a full review - just a heads up so you know about the firewire issue (and the impact it may have on you directly) before you purchase it.  it seems now this issue is widely known anyway, but i think at least here you can decide for yourself as to whether it is the be all and end all or just another feature that would have been cool if it was left in.  also note this mac's hard drive is insanely easy to replace, so if your drive was on it's way out, you could replace it, reinstall the os, and put your failing hdd into a usb enclosure (which could cost the same as a firewire cable) to attempt to recover data.  i also put in another paragraph or two at the end on other first impressions.the only thing i would like to add to the the current reviews is that the firewire port was dropped on the macbook models (not the pros though).  this is the only thing that worries me because of the inability for the computer to take advantage of target disk mode.  you may never have used it before, but it's one of those features that set apart macs from everything else.  booting the mac holding the letter 't' will make it boot to target disk (a large firewire symbol will float on the screen).  then connecting to another mac with a firewire cable will make it show up on the other mac's desktop just like any external drive would.  this is perfect for transferring files quickly and easily, also a great troubleshooting step if the mac will not boot, as it may boot to target disk, allowing you to recover files to another mac before replacing the hard drive if it's on it's way out - it may not boot normally, but may boot to target disk (note, if the mac will not boot but you are sure it's not a hardware issue, you can just do an archive and install, reinstalling your operating system while keeping your files).another reason many people have used it is for account migrating if upgrading from another mac.  migration assistant now uses ethernet, so you are still set here.if you own a camcorder - please make sure it supports usb 2.0, too, unless you are in the market for a new one of those too.oh - and i have a feeling all this firewire business might have something to do with usb 3.0 - which it looks like we will be seeing crop up in devices next year.just wanted to make sure you are aware of this before you make your decision!ok, so the 'another paragraph or two on other first impressions' - firstly, don't think that anyone could give you a reasonable review of a product that just came out a few days ago.  customer reviews are by far the most important thing i look at when deciding to buy something, but please bear in mind that you don't have the awesome posts by people who have actually owned the product more than five minutes yet.  anyway - so the screen - personally i like it, and yes, sometimes i can see the light fixture's reflection behind me when i'm powering up.  the blacks also look a little faded as per some reviews, but then again, the screen border is jet black, and i wonder if that makes it appear worse than it actually is.  also, when looking at an angle, mine looks ok left to right - even at the tightest angle, although not so much if i am looking at the screen from above.  i say 'ok' because it's not perfect (colours seem to darken a little), but then again, i'm really not going to be watching a movie from 10 feet away at a 45 degree angle on a 13.3 inch screen.  but that's just me - it's the way i roll, evidently.i'd recommend trying it out if you can at an apple store - see for yourself, understand that people can be really upset if they spend a lot of money and it doesn't work as *perfectly* as they expect it to, and that also the opposite is true - that people need their decisions reinforced and may tend to leave shinier than normal reviews.  my own 5 star rating?  four for the product and an extra one as it's apple makes five.  honestly though i love it but there could be improvements.  the pronounced edges make my wrists a little sore.  also it's about getting used to a smaller screen than my last notebook had (not apple's fault, but i am sure many people might have this issue).  no firewire may suck in the future, but right now it's not an issue.  deciding how to replace roboform with something mac compatible is my biggest nightmare (again that's not on apple).that's it! hope it helps!","Date":"October 19, 2008"}
{"Title":"Mostly improvements, but a few flaws...","Author":"Adam Dachis \"adachis\"","ReviewID":"RCIS69GDHU76X","Overall":"good","Content":"I'd been waiting for these laptops since the introduction of Intel processors in Macs.  The MacBook Pros used nearly the exact same case design for far too long.  While I didn't think the MacBooks really needed a design refresh, I like the choices Apple made so much that I bought one.  I like having a smaller laptop, though I do appreciate some of the additional features you get with a MacBook Pro.  That said, many of the extra bells and whistles once left out of the MacBooks have found their way in and while I never really thought I'd care I have to say--it makes a huge difference.Owning a new aluminum MacBook is a lot more like owning one of the old 12\" Powerbooks.  I used to have one and it was wonderful.  It's probably the one discontinued Apple computer that's coveted by its owners.  Their resale value is still fairly high, considering how comparatively slow they are.  If you're a blogger or a writer and you don't use the machine for much else, it's sort of a best of breed.  However, with these new aluminum MacBooks I think things have changed.  You get a backlit keyboard in the higher end model (which is the one I'm reviewing), an aluminum body (of course), and a multitouch trackpad.  I think the backlit keyboard is the nicest addition.  It's really something you appreciate more once you've used it.  I've never had any difficulty typing in the dark but I can't see myself ever buying a machine without a backlit keyboard again.  It's incredibly helpful when you need to type a special character or press a function button.  If you don't have the usual key positions memorized, I imagine it's even better.  This makes the high end MacBook feel a lot more like a MacBook Pro.Regarding the aluminum unibody Apple likes to talk about so highly, it's very nice.  While they did this with the Macbook Air, it seems much more refined with the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros.  My one complaint, which I feel will fade over time, is that it sometimes looks too perfect.  I don't mean this as a backhanded compliment, but that there is such a thing as being so perfect it lacks a human touch.  Think about listening to a computer play a song versus a human.  It's just not as good.  Well, technically the computer is better but that human touch is relevant to us.  This machine is so exact and precise that it sometimes feels inhuman.  At the same time, it is rather stunning.  I think I'll get past the lack of human imperfections as I get used to looking at it each day.The multitouch trackpad is something I'm not foreign to, as I used a MacBook Air for awhile.  The new trackpad space is identical.  I found this very fortunate as I don't like buying new machines without being able to get a Marware Protection Pack as well.  Luckily I bought a MacBook Air pack and it fit perfectly.  Even the trackpad film fit.  While multitouch gestures didn't make their way into my regular routine too often, I did use them here and there and am glad they now exist throughout Apple's line of laptops.  The disadvantage of the new trackpad is the lack of a button.  Yes, the whole trackpad is a button and yes it's very clickable.  The problem is that sometimes the click doesn't register.  I turned on single and double taps for left click and right click (respectively), but sometimes those don't register as well.  If this were my first Apple laptop, I'd panic and run to the Genius Bar for help.  Since I've been through a few of these, I've found that it takes a month or two before you really break in the button.  I've had the laptop for about ten days now and it's already working better.  Still, I wish it just clicked as expected out of the box.  For those that are wondering how you click and drag if there's no actual button, you just kind of pretend there is a button.  While Apple gives you the entire trackpad for tracking, and you can click pretty much anywhere (with resistance building more and more as you move upwards), you can expect this trackpad to work just like the MacBook Air's trackpad.  The space where the Air's button would be is where you can safely rest a thumb (or whatever) for clicking.  It will not register as a second finger as easily.  If you pretend there is a button at the bottom of the trackpad, you'll quickly forget there isn't one.But those are the bells and whistles.  As far as performance goes, there's not much excitement in regards to speed.  The computer's architecture has changed, but the Core 2 Duo processors aren't really much faster (or any faster as the case may be here).  The big jump is in the new graphics processor from NVIDIA.  I'm not going to pretend to be a hardcore gamer.  I don't play many games, and especially not when it comes to those that are GPU-intensive.  I can't give you frame rates from World of Warcraft or anything like that.  What I can tell you is that the new NVIDIA graphics make for smoother performance around the operating system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.One of my favorite things about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  I ran an H.264 video encode today so I could put a video on my iPhone and it didn't feel hot at all.  The MacBook Air heats up in about five seconds and then cripples the GPU first, before throttling anything else, and gets pretty warm.  You could iron a shirt with the old MacBooks and I won't even start with the MacBook Pros.  I can't believe how cool this machine has been.  I'm not punishing it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without breaking a sweat is pretty amazing.  It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop and didn't worry about becoming sterile.  I don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.I get about four hours of battery life under normal usage.  While this still doesn't quite match what Apple promises, it's the highest I've ever, realistically, gotten out of an Apple laptop.  I'm more than happy with four hours.  I rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.Another neat feature of the new MacBooks (and MacBook Pros) is that you can use your iPhone/iPod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over iTunes.  Since I swap my iPhone headphones out of the iPhone and into the laptop very frequently, this is fantastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've been interrupted and clicked the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that I can't.  Now I can.  This is wonderful.So far I've only had good things to say and that's because, overall, this is an excellent machine.  I want to talk about a few bad things, however.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is the display.  This is why I've rated it a four and not a five.  The display is an embarrassment.  If you have any intention of doing any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you.  The viewing angle is so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast.  I don't notice it quite as much when I'm surfing the web or just writing, but when I watch a video it's very apparent.  If you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine.  Get a MacBook Pro where it's not an issue.  Even the old MacBooks have better displays.  I don't do visual work on this machine for that reason.  If it's not critical, I might, but for the most part I work on my desktop machine instead.Another downside about the display is that it's glossy.  These look cool and all, but the reflections are obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast.  This is a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruins it further.  For general use, this isn't a big deal.  If you want to color correct or design, Apple has pretty much opted to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware.  Matte screens are just not going to be an option anymore.  I think this is a stupid choice, because the people who kept Apple alive are the designers who chose Macs early on in Apple's history.  The loyalists are generally not fond of glossy screens and have been vocal about it.  I think having an option is fine, but forcing people to use glossy screens is awful.  Being a loyalist and needing a matte screen, I've just started using my laptop for everything but color critical work.  It's allowed me to prefer working on a smaller screen, which is nice because it means less computer to cart around.  I've been able to work around this problem, but my situation allowed for it.  It's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.The other disadvantage is a lack of Firewire.  While I rarely employed Firewire in my laptops, especially after using the MacBook Air (which has none), I still liked having it around.  I don't really miss that it's gone.  Again, this is primarily due to having a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything.  Whether or not this is a major issue is really up to the individual.  If you know you need it, you have your answer.  Personally, I wish Apple would've kept it until they had something better to replace it with.  Maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing.  I would just like to see a USB 2.0 alternative, since USB 2.0 doesn't quite live up to its claims.When it comes to upgrades and replacements, this machine gets a little better and a little worse.  If you're upgrading from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Pro, you're getting easier upgrades all around.  If you're used to upgrades in a MacBook, however, I'd say things are better and worse.  If you want to replace RAM, you have to remove the bottom case.  It's not that hard to do but it means keeping track of quite a few screws and exposing the entirety of your machine's innards.  If you're simply replacing the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out.  One of the first things I did is replace the hard drive with a solid state disk.  They're getting cheaper and you can get a 120GB or 128GB drive for much less than what Apple offers.  But on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an SSD you now have that option as a custom order.  While in tests SSD hasn't really proven to have too many benefits, in real world practice it makes the machine feel much snappier.  For that reason, having an SSD is worth it.Apple's RAM upgrade prices are also not as terrible as they used to be.  At least, it seems that way.  A RAM upgrade through a third party only saves $10-20.  When spending a lot of money on a new machine, I think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small savings that come with doing it yourself.Anyway, that pretty much covers the majority of the relevant pros and cons of the new MacBook.  So far I love it.  I think it's a wonderfully made machine.  It's sturdy, it's attractive and it works really well.  I've very pleased with it and as long as you can handle the poor display, I highly recommend this MacBook.","Date":"October 26, 2008"}

{"Title":"Solid Notebook Hits the Sweet Spot","Author":"Horatio Hornblower \"HH\"","ReviewID":"R1LTAOFTE9YQWH","Overall":"good","Content":"I am very pleased with my purchase of the 2.4 GHz Aluminum MacBook. While it is reasonable to wish other features were available or to feel the price is too high, it is ludicrous to rate this laptop a \"1\" as some have done.Take the screen issue for instance. I spent an hour at the apple store before purchasing this laptop comparing the display to that of the MacBook Pro. Back and forth I went, playing sample video after sample video, looking from different viewing angles, trying to see what the complaint was. I'm sorry, maybe my eyes are not so good for that sort of thing, but I just didn't see that big a difference. I'm not saying there is no difference and I do think the MacBook Pro looked a little better. But I would in no way characterize the display as bad or washed out.As far as the glossy display...it is reflective as are most new laptops these days. However, the LED display is so bright that even in the sunlight (as is the case as I type this ) I can see the screen perfectly well. I know many people prefer the matte screen, especially photo buffs. Perhaps Apple will bring the matte back as an option. I think the display is VERY good and much improved over my last macbook...much brighter.The fit and finish of this laptop is outstanding! It really does feel like a solid block of metal with absolutely no \"flexing\" when holding in one hand. I have never had a laptop, PC or Mac, that felt like it was put together so well. It is just a beautifully designed notebook with clean, simple lines as opposed to some notebooks I've seen that are almost garish with the colors and flashing lights.I chose the 2.4 Ghz Model over the 2.0 GHz Macbook. While this increased the price by $ 300 +/- , the faster processor, larger hardrive, and backlit keyboard was worth it to me. I really like the backlit keyboard as I am often working with the lights down. If those things are not important to you, save yourself $ 300 and get the 2.0 GHz. You really won't notice much difference in speed.On the other hand, if a somewhat better and larger 15.4 \"display, and a discreet graphics card for more demanding tasks ( such as gaming ) are important, you may prefer the MacBook Pro. I may have gone this way myself but I personally prefer the smaller screen as it is easier to travel with and use on a plane.The price? Too high? Perhaps so if you do not feel that the Mac OS is for you. One can certainly buy a VERY fast and feature rich PC for less than the price of the MacBook. However, for a marginally higher investment, I feel I have a very well made and extremely functional notebook that I don't need to worry about.","Date":"November 5, 2008"}
{"Title":"A step closer towards perfection","Author":"P. Tan","ReviewID":"R35GHZGX1PNEAT","Overall":"good","Content":"A beautiful and stunning notebook both inside and out. I can not even begin to tell you how passionate I am about this device since the day I got it. The Unibody Macbook is generations ahead when compared to equivalent notebooks with similar specifications. There are countless reviews out there so in this review I would like to share with you the little things that are often overlooked, yet can make an impact to your buying decisions.Hardware:Build and design - Unlike the polycarbonate version, the unibody clearly feels solid. It is not a marketing gimmick and by far the most solid notebook you'll ever pick up. Lenovos were traditionally viewed as the 'tough' book class for business environments but the unibody manufacturing process has changed my view completely. (Although not recommended), there is virtually no flex picking up and holding the unibody by the edges.Turn the macbook over and all you find is a clean and well presented underside. There are no ugly FCC stickers, no Windows COA stickers. International and Bluetooth certifications? Intel inside stickers? Nope. Although some of these regulations are required to be displayed, the bare minimum is etched onto the back cover as a monochrome type instead. I have seen countless laptops being scarred left right and center with all sorts of horrendous stickers both on the palm rest and the back. To complete, there only 4 visible screws flushed against the aluminum back cover and actually the only ones you'll ever find on the entire notebook. The remainder is hidden underneath the battery latch. When was the last time you counted the number of screws on your laptop? The unibody incorporates 'defensive design' - should you find the need to open up the notebook to upgrade the memory, you will notice that there are strategically assigned magnetic areas which catch these screws if you accidentally dropped them in the process.I had been tearing apart trying to decide whether a backlit keyboard (2.0ghz vs 2.4ghz model) deemed necessary for the extra cost. The processor and hard drive upgrade was insignificant but I had no regrets going for a model with a backlit keyboard. I am a touch typer yet I still find it helps considerably especially during low lighting situations such as being on a plane, checking mails first thing at dawn where you would find yourself typing passwords or quick email replies in these low lighting situations.Around the notebook, you'll notice that battery indicator on the side - No point having it at the bottom where the battery is if it means you have to turn it over to find out. This is extremely helpful when you are in the middle of a full screen presentation. There are no annoying or blinking indicator LEDs that you find on other notebooks. With exception of the sleep indicator just to the left of the infra red receiver. In fact, it is not even visible at all until it is actually indicating sleep mode. There are no latches to get your business/long sleeve shirt caught onto and the lid shuts with a solid thud which got me to believe that to even produce that kind of sound, it requires all edges of the lid to come into contact with the base all at the same time.All connectors/ports have been assigned to the left side of the notebook, a feature I find that many other notebooks lack - For example, I tend to use wireless but on occasion fall back on Ethernet LAN, with the previous notebooks I owned I had to look left, right and behind to locate ports which I do not frequent. The unibody design meant that every port you'll need is always in one side of the notebook. Also keeps your desk tidy rather than having cables running in every direction out from the notebook.The fan is extraordinarily quiet when in operation. I would hear the hard drive spinning over the centrifugal fan. Vents are placed at the top of the notebook between the keyboard and the display. This is critical because with most notebooks I find they tend to draw air from the side (or worse at the bottom) of the notebook which meant that dust could get drawn inside the unit.It is not widely known that the speakers have actually been upgraded from the previous polycarbonate version. It even boasts a mini subwoofer but do not expect it to perform miracles.The multi touch trackpad is a joy to use once you get accustomed to it. There have been plenty of criticisms, both positive and negative about this however I found it did not take me long to realize that I am far more productive using it daily without requiring a dedicated external mouse. It is highly configurable and even does right clicks for those skeptics out there, and my advise is to kick the habit of physically pushing down for a left/right click and instead use the multi touch capability to distinguish between the two. Try it out at an Apple Retail Store.A review is never complete with negative comments however it is impossibly difficult to expose the faults of the Unibody Macbook. My only concern was the poor LED display quality when viewing at an angle - colors appear washed out when viewed at an angle - something which Apple has addressed recently with a silent upgrade. Mentioned by others, the glass display does attract fingerprints but it is nothing too strange about any Apple device in the first place. The lack of firewire ports seemed to be a strategic decision for potential buyers to consider the 15\" pro cousin instead.In conclusion, Apple has once again redefined the standard of notebooks and made me accept nothing less in terms of design and quality from a notebook manufacturer. Apple has always made great devices and other manufacturers can make great things too. For the latter, sadly that is still not entirely the case. The unibody macbook may not be the device for everyone, but it is certainly a notebook that made a right step towards perfection. I hope after reading this you are able to take away some of the insights that I found to have contributed towards the joy of using it everyday.","Date":"May 30, 2009"}
{"Title":"Hardcore PC guy giving Mac a chance...","Author":"Techie \"WDC\"","ReviewID":"R135CDOLUM4ZWF","Overall":"good","Content":"FIRST IMPRESSIONS:I had to give up my HP laptop so I saw this as an opportunity to try out the new Macbook. Granted, it was a few hundred $ more than an equivalent PC but I really don't mind paying extra for quality - and without a doubt, quality was what I got. I've checked it out quite a few times at the Apple Stores prior to making my purchase but for some reason I was a lot more impressed after getting one and having hands-on with it for a few days. The unibody gives it a very solid feel and the build-quality is un-comparable by any PCs that I've seen/used. This is a work of art. I find myself wiping it obsessively on a daily basis and I would leave it on top of my desk just to show it off. The magnetic \"Magsafe\" power cord is genius as I've already kicked it off a few times.THE SETUP:I've never used a Mac before and was a little bit hesitant so I Boot Camped it and installed Windows 7 Beta on it. The installation went flawlessly. All the drivers were included on the CD. Just to test out the 9400M capabilities, I installed Far Cry 2 and Prince of Persia to see how it would run. Well, let's just say it runs ok when set close to the lowest graphic settings but the machine heated up pretty quickly. So if you're a hard core gamer this is probably not for you... But to just play a little bit here and there to kill some time it's pretty ideal (or pop in an older game). Far Cry 2 reported that \"My vdo drivers are too old please update\" but newer drivers are nowhere to be found. So perhaps with a drivers update it'll get better, we'll see. I also installed 2 older games, Jade Empire Special Edition and Fable the Lost Chapters. Both runs very nicely at the highest res and AA x2 (medium detail etc). Nvidia drivers does not support this Chipset and Apple does not offer updates for it, quite frustrating.OS X / USER EXPERIENCE:As for using the OS X. It did take me a little time to learn it and get used to it. Being technically savvy, I was able to figure everything out within a day or two. The first epiphany came when I realized that I can forever do away with the mouse (except when gaming or using Photoshop). This extra large track pad is very intuitive. One finger tap to click, 2 finger tap to right-click, 1-finger double-tap to drag, two finger motion to scroll/zoom/rotate, 3 finger swipe to browse, 4 finger swipe to select a different running app... etc., I never knew so much can be done with just 4 fingers. The MAC OS X is much easier to use than Windows. Everything you need is VERY easy to access and everything else that you MIGHT need is minimized. Spaces - Very cool concept. I set all my chat clients (MSN, iChat, Skype) to one space (desktop) and work stuff on another. Simple tapping switches from one space to the next. There's this other thing where you can set all the corners of your screen to have different functions. Shooting my pointer all the way to the upper-right turns off the screen. Perfect when I'm browsing in bed and it's the last thing I do right before passing out. Powering on and off is extremely fast - Much faster than Windows (Powers off in 5sec). Battery life seems exceptionally better compared to Windows (on the same machine), which tells me that OS X is probably much better optimized. Good 4 hours of usage prior to drain, something that I can only dream of on my previous laptop. The led battery indicator lights up at a touch of a button even when the power is off to give you a quick juice status. Resuming from sleep mode, the WIFI connects instantly without problems (even if it's waking up to a new network).THE CONS:... You guessed it, the crazy glare on the screen... Doesn't bother me that much because I'm used to it from my previous (HP) laptop. Would I recommend the new MacBook? You bet... Would I purchase this MacBook all over again? You bet...","Date":"January 27, 2009"}

{"Title":"Nice Machine but Expensive and Some Flaws; Caution for Windows Migrants","Author":"SanjeevP \"Bottom Line\"","ReviewID":"R1YG8H6O07GXA6","Overall":"good","Content":"Having used several Windows notebooks over the years - ThinkPad, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba, Sony VAIO - this is my first Apple notebook. Although, I have lusted after Mac OS for years, it wasn't practical because most of my work software is Windows. Now, the ability to run Windows on Mac notebooks has changed that and it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Amongst the Windows notebooks, ThinkPad has always been my favorite, and this MacBook is replacing ThinkPad X31.MacBook is fast, feels very solid and sturdy, thin and has bright LED display with vivid colors and fast graphics. Some people are complaining about the glossy screen; but I found glare a problem only with bright light facing the screen. Battery life is decent, about 4 hours. Self adjusting screen brightness, depending upon ambient light, does not work very well and I had to turn it off. Backlit keyboard is excellent. You will like large multi-touch track pad after you get used to it. Two finger scrolling and right click are very convenient. In lot of ways Mac OS is superior than Windows, and especially Vista. Mac OS applications are lot more fun and easier to use, not to mention less crashes, freezes and viruses and malware.Being a migrant from Windows, I miss dedicated PgDn and PgUp keys; it also lacks numLk, Home, End, and Del (forward) keys. Lack of Firewire can be a problem if you do not have another computer with one and need to use it for camcorder etc. Card reader is also absent and it is not easy to transfer camera pictures unless the camera also works as a card reader. Neither is there an express card slot or 3G modem. Cost is definitely a lot more than similarly equipped Windows notebooks. Mac versions of Quicken, Quickbooks, Dragon speech and several others programs are not as good as Windows versions which I have been using under Windows and Fusion. Theoretically you can use Windows on the MacBook but in practice many files saved in one operating system cannot be opened by the other operating system. For example, Windows cannot open many of my photos, documents and spreadsheets saved in MacBook (\"Disk read error\"). Potential Windows migrants really ought to look before they leap into the Mac OS.I feel the ideal weight for a truly mobile computer should be 2-3 lbs and screen 12 inches. 13.3 inch screen has a big footprint and 4.5 lbs is slightly heavy. MacBook Air is not as powerful, is expensive, has smaller hard drive and lacks ports. And the main reason to get MacBook Pro is if you need firewire port and do lot of graphics intensive work. I loved my  ThinkPad X31 with 12.4 inch screen, 3 lb weight and all the ports. For me the ideal computer would have been a ThinkPad X200 with Mac OS; I figured that in absence of that, this MacBook could be the next best choice. But so far, I have mixed feelings about trading ThinkPad for MacBook.","Date":"October 24, 2008"}

The 15.4\" are way too bulky, the 13\" is just right - lightweight and portableThe neutral:(1) The brightness adjustment of the screen is too responsive - if you're sitting with your back to a lightsource, every time the book moves or your body moves will change screen brightness noticeably.(2) Don't like that I can't move the screen all the way back into the horizontal. Depending on how I sit, that's a very natural way for my to type.(3) I can sort of live without firewire. It's lame and I'll need to sell some of my hardware, but I can deal.The bad:(1) The screen. I could live with the glossiness, but the viewing angle is bad. A much larger/higher resolution screen would have fit the form factor if not for the insanely large bezel around it.(2) Battery life: with my factory new macbook, I get about 2h at best. Compare to the advertised 5h.(3) Lack of a card reader of standard video ports. This is a huge deal if you bought the book for it's small form factor, because now you'll have to carry around lots of accessories all the time. How the Hardware Designers justify not adding $10 in everyday use parts to a 1300 USD machine is beyond me. Ouch.(4) UPDATE: Recurring hangs when resuming from sleep. About one in every 30 times I close the lid, the macbook will either show a black screen or a spinning beachball upon reopening, with no recourse except a hard reset. Very disappointing :( I guess the lesson here is the old \"never buy a v1 product from Apple\" adage.Overall, nice enough not to return, but not worth the money I paid for it. If you can, wait 8 months for the next generation which will hopefully fix some of the design decisions that went into this product.","Date":"November 2, 2008"}
{"Title":"Thoughts from someone who has switched","Author":"Benjamin Jolivet \"Bookster\"","ReviewID":"R3S5QB9OLJW35C","Overall":"good","Content":"In the first couple days after getting my Macbook, I felt like the guy who is last to see a movie everyone loves. Everyone has been laughing and quoting it and telling me I have to see it, and when I finally get around to it, I think \"Oh . . . but it's just a movie.\" After about six months of researching and being sold on Macs, I thought \"Oh . . . but it's just a computer.\" It was a sad moment when I realized it wasn't going to change my life. I suppose as sort of a non-computer person, I was seduced into expecting it to hold me when I cried and make me breakfast in the morning. It doesn't do either one of those things.I'm happy to say that I've grown quite fond of my Mac, after a fashion, even though it consistently refuses to do my dishes and hasn't actually changed my life. I will probably never be the Mac culty I thought I might become, but I don't see myself going back to Windows. I've sipped the kool-aid and found it delicious refreshing.Some things I like:-It doesn't come loaded with a lot of useless stuff you'll never use; the applications that do come installed are things you're going to use, or at least want to play with.-Leopard is really easy to use, and it's incredibly attractive. (I'll be a geek and admit I love the genie-in-the-bottle effect when minimizing something to the dock.)-The \"Scrabble tile\" keyboard is really nice and looks sleek.-The whole system and the unit are simple. There aren't extraneous lights, buttons, etc; everything does what it looks like it's going to do, and it doesn't look like an airport landing strip.-The backlit keyboard is actually really useful; I wasn't sure it would be.-The trackpad with all the gestures isn't as \"gimmicky\" as I'd read; the 3-finger forward and backward, and 4-finger expose features are really useful (though the 3-finger gestures don't work in every application).-Finding files is so easy, and it's actually led me to be more organized in my saving of work; Time Machine works incredibly well--I can't remember a single successful backup of my Windows computer, ever. That's not Mac-freak speak; it's true.-It's light and compact and I don't need a special bag to put it in, I can fit the adapter and the notebook in my backpack.-The battery life, while not quite as good as advertised, is miles above what I'm used to.-Office for Mac isn't as bad as a lot of the reviews I read say it is; I actually like it and find it simpler and easier to use than the Windows version. It did take some adjustment, though.Some things I don't like:-It is beautiful, but it's a scratch magnet. Aluminum is a soft metal, and within days I had three or four noticeable scratches that I can't trace the origin of. I broke down and put on a see-through Speck case for it, because my OCD was kicking in. I hated the case at first, but it's ultimately not that bad--aside from the dust that collects in the front, bottom corners. I just feel as though something that costs this much should stay pristine longer.-Screenshots, which probably isn't a common practice for most people, is sort of complex.-Shortcuts take some getting used to. Using \"command\" in place of \"alt\" for Word shortcuts is a big change--and when I go back to work to use a Windows computer, I make mistakes doing that, too.-I'm not yet sold on \"Mail\" and \"iCal\" being better than Outlook. One of the reasons I was sold on the Mac was the \"Mail\" feature of Notes and To-Dos--this feature has actually not worked correctly once. When I talked to AppleCare, they told me most people don't use that feature and so they don't have much information about it. About 3 or 3 weeks later, I'm still waiting for word on what's wrong with it. It's minor, clearly, as most people aren't using it, but I was annoyed.-Finally, there's what my friend calls \"Mac fear.\" Essentially, the terror that comes with realizing you've spent a huge amount of money on a notebook and that it could get stolen or somehow damaged. I never really worried about that before. AppleCare protection plans and LoJack for Laptops alleviate the fear, but not much.Ultimately I like the Mac a lot, and I'm glad I made the switch. As someone who works full time and also goes to school online full time, I find that it's important to have a computer I don't mind sitting in front of and lugging around with me everywhere. That's the Mac. If you're interested and can afford it, go for it. But, if, like me, you had a relatively new notebook and you were wondering if you should give in and replace it, I'd say hang on for a while. At the end of the day, it's just a computer. A nice computer, and one that works well . . . but, again, it's not going to pay your rent, wash your car, or have dinner with that relative you can't stand . . . buyer beware.","Date":"May 10, 2009"}
{"Title":"Great upgrade for the average Mac user.","Author":"Corey Martin \"Helpy McHelperson\"","ReviewID":"R23XCPS2OV9VJF","Overall":"good","Content":"This MacBook is a great upgrade all things considered.  I am a longtime Mac user and have used them for everything from graphic design work to simple college papers.  I recently upgraded to this Mac from an Ibook G4.  If you are intending to use this Mac for heavy graphic design and professional video editing then it may not be for you.  I would like to refute a few of the bad reviews people have given.1.) There is no firewire - This is apparent by simply looking at the laptop and thus if you use firewire often then don't buy it, this will save some time returning it.  Many average users do not need firewire and transferring files from an old Mac is still very easy with this new MacBook.2.)  Some have said the screen has a bluish tint or washed out look - I have not yet run into this problem.  Make sure your display's color settings are set to LCD color and you will have deep blacks and crisp whites.  The colors in this display are clearly vibrant and the new NVIDIA graphics card ensures that your images look beautiful.3.)  The glossy screen problem - Yes, the screen is glossy, but a simple adjustment of your viewing angle is all that needs to be done in order to lose the reflections.  This also aids in the vibrancy of blacks and whites.  Using the MacBook outside seems to give off more reflection so if you plan on using it outside you may want to purchase a matte screen film.  However, I have not had major problems with reflections.Overall this MacBook is solid upgrade for the average Mac user.  So, you average Mac users out there, the pros of this Mac far outweigh the cons.","Date":"December 3, 2008"}

It was a good machine, but this one blows it out of the water. Not only does it take on some of its older brother's look, but it truly is an impressive machine with the the additional touch pad.Pros:- Beautiful, seamless design similar to the previous Macbook Pro aluminum design- Easy to open compartment on the bottom for accessing the hard drive, battery, and RAM- Doesn't get very \"Hot.\" I've yet to think I need to put it on something when its on my lap, even despite watching DVDs or doing other intensive work.- Quick little machine. As mentioned, blows my original Macbook out of the water- Side Battery Readout- Touch Pad (this is a plus and minus)- Bright, LED screen (although its glossy, I personally prefer the matte finish)- New Nvidia graphics chipset... Much better than the Intel GMACons:- Sometimes, for me, the track pad doesn't \"click\" (seems to be a known issue now), and, even occasionally not even work. It just stops moving the mouse despite me moving my finger- The glossy display, like all other glossy displays, reflects a decent amount- $[...] model doesn't include the backlit keyboard (Why??)- Wish RAM was a little easier to access, but not too bad. Previous design was easier- Wish this was the intro Macbook model- No longer includes remote for FrontRow (or maybe mine was missing?)- No Firewire 400 portOverall, this is a fantastic computer.

{"Title":"Good Generational Improvement","Author":"Yu-jin Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","ReviewID":"R1FW5STBEKUNGB","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned a white polycarb MacBook for just over a year, and recently bought one of these new ones. As such, this review largely covers improvements and differences between these two models. I understand that the older gen MacBooks are still available both new and secondhand, and as such many might be interested in knowing how they differ.Sheer performance wise, this machine is on par with my older MacBook. This is significant when you consider that I upgraded that one to the same amount of RAM (2 GB) and that it had a more powerful processor (2.2 ghz, as opposed to 2.0). For sheer crunching power, it's a very fast machine- made more so by the innate superiority of the Mac OS. Startup time is measured in seconds, and it is good to go in a heartbeat from sleep mode.The case design looks nicer, is less prone to scratching and discoloration, and is thinner and feels more solid. The whole package is lighter, and the screen seems to be improved as well (brighter in general, and sharper). Some customers have reported a lot of glare on the glossy display, but I haven't really noticed (admittedly, I'm known to not notice when my windshield is dirty either, though). The keyboard has a different feel to it than the previous one- less plastic and more rubbery. It makes less noise, but the general size, feel, and response is similar. I like it. The trackpad is now a 'glass' one piece pad, with no visible button. You push the bottom part to click, and can perform most iPhone-style multitouch input. It is a huge improvement over the old touchpad- far more responsive, especially when your fingers aren't perfectly dry. The surface feels much smoother as well, and it's easier to clean. One important thing to note: this 'low end' MacBook does not have the backlit keyboard. That's only in the high-end model. Personally, I don't really care- backlit KBs are more for show than function in my opinion, and it uses more battery power.I am a gamer, and as such I was particularly interested in the improved graphics suite on the new MacBook. My older one used an Intel integrated X3100 GPU. It was fine for things that were 2 or more years old, but let's just say you probably don't want to try playing Call of Duty 4 on it. I loaded up WoW on it and got from 10-20 FPS in most areas on the lowest settings. Not too hot. Right off, I can say that the new MacBook has greatly improved graphics performance (in the case of WoW, at least 20 FPS on medium settings). While it might be a stretch to say it has 5 times better performance (as noted in the spec sheet) the nVidia GF 9400M is certainly at least double the power of the old Intel integrated. I wouldn't recommend you replace your gaming rig with a vanilla MacBook- for that, you probably want a Pro at least- but it'll do in a pinch.The MacBook has a built-in camera and mic, and hidden speakers. All of them perform very well- I've used the camera and mic for videoconferencing, and they turn out as good a picture and quality as you'd expect out of any laptop. The speakers are good enough for movie playback; no complaints in that regard. As with the previous Macs, iLife suite and quite a few other tools are included, making the machine a true multimedia station right out of the box. The software is very intuitive and well designed.Input ports are perhaps the only concern for the MacBook. There's a headphone, mic jack, ethernet, mini-DVI, and 2 USB ports. Unlike the previous MacBook and the Pro, there's no FireWire port. There aren't any good solutions for adapting FireWire to fit a USB or ethernet port, so if you have older devices that can't use USB you might be out of luck. While the DVI port is nice and small, you need to buy adapter heads to use it with anything. The SuperDrive is as good as ever, and seems to make less noise loading and ejecting than previous incarnations. Apple Remote is an option that you have to pay extra for now; it was free with my old machine. I liked it, but don't really miss it. The MagSafe power adapter looks completely identical to my old one, even down to the somewhat mismatched polycarbonate white casing.Generally speaking, the new MacBook runs quiet and warm- rarely hot, and never along the entire case as the old one sometimes did. I frequently had the fan rev up to really high speed on my older machine, especially when viewing movies- this one handles it without so much as a whisper.In terms of modifiability, replacing or changing RAM is very similar to the old MacBook. Replacing the hard drive is even easier- it's literally right there by the battery when you open the battery cover, and you can pull it right out. Apple used to purposely make it really hard to upgrade or swap components; I'm glad they've decided to steer away from that rather frustrating doctrine.About the only major minus I've seen when comparing machines is battery life. The older MacBook definitely lasted longer and took less time to charge. I'm pretty sure this has something to do with the new graphics processor and perhaps some sort of logic board modifications (the older one was notorious for randomly failing). It is probably also why it tends to run cooler when plugged into AC power, which I think is a worthwhile tradeoff for slightly longer charge times.Warranty-wise, Apple is very solid for repairs under coverage. I had a logic board failure in my old machine, and had it replaced and ready for pickup within the same day at the local Apple store. Macs come with 1 year full coverage, extendable to 3 years. I recommend you purchase that warranty, and additionally- if you bought from a third party vendor like Amazon- make sure that they have your actual purchase date in their records. They often go from the sale date to the VENDOR, not to you, and that isn't really right or fair. Call AppleCare and they'll be glad to fix it for you.If you own an older MacBook, the question of upgrading is a bit tricky. I gave my white MacBook to a friend that needed a computer, so this was a replacement. If you're just shopping for upgrades, bear in mind that aside from style and video performance the new MacBook is not a great deal better than the old one. That said, the old one was pretty darn good as is, and if you're thinking of buying this as your first Mac or first Apple laptop, it comes with my highest recommendations. Frankly, there is no good reason not to choose a Mac over a Windows laptop, unless you simply can't afford one. Don't believe it? Go visit a local Apple store and see for yourself. You will be convinced.","Date":"April 19, 2009"}
{"Title":"Another Vista to Mac Convert","Author":"B. Yang","ReviewID":"RXDFO3Q3MVKWC","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been a PC guy my whole life.  I briefly owned an iBook with OS 10.3 Panther and I hated it. I was a bit reluctant to buy another Mac but I've had about enough of Windows Vista.I had been using a Sony VAIO with Vista for about a year before it started giving me guff. Certain music production applications (Ableton Live and Reason) would stall on start up and it would take me 3-5 time of ending the task and restarting the app before I could getting it running properly. These two programs were the only ones that had this issue. I tried reinstalling the programs but that solved nothing. I also had issues with a couple of the MS updates, IE updates and a .NET update would not install. After contacting MS tech support, they prescribed a complete Vista reinstall as a remedy. I thought that was a bit much just to install a couple of updates. These issues along with Vista's sluggish performance convinced me to give OS X another try.As with all of my big purchases, I did my fair share of research and read countless reviews, positive and negative ones. One of the recurring themes in the negative reviews I read were the objections to the new glossy glass displays. \"It's a mirror disguised as a computer display,\" some said. When I first took the computer out of the box and saw how reflective the display was, I started thinking about all of those reviews. When I powered the computer on, all of those unfavorable reviews seemed unfounded. The bright LED display, for the most part, is able to counter its mirror-like properties.The MacBook's physique with it's all aluminum case, and sleek, slim design is, of course, a huge part of the Mac's appeal. I personally love the feel of the keyboard on the MacBook and the new trackpad with the multi-touch gestures. When I first heard about the multi-touch gestures, I thought it was just a gimmick. However, after using them, I must say they're very practical. Namely, two-finger tap for right-click, two-finger scroll, and four-finger swipe for Exposé.OS X is great at handling system resources, especially when compared to Vista. Upon start up, without any applications open OS X only uses 285 MBs of RAM while Vista hogs 760 MBs of RAM. Coming from Windows, I do feel like OS X is a bit limited in some areas but I'll be able to live with it.Although my MacBook will be my main computer, I also have an old bulky IBM ThinkPad running Windows XP as my backup laptop/travel buddy. This MacBook has changed my mind about Apple products and OS X. But that's not to say that I'm a Mac zealot now. I still cling to XP and I have high hopes for Windows 7. I'm sure I'll lust for a new computer with Windows 7 when it's finally released. For now, though, I'm very pleased with my MacBook.Pros:-Design-Aluminum unibody case-Quiet running computer-Keyboard-Trackpad with multi-touch gestures-Bundled software-Able to run Windows with Boot Camp or virtualization apps-Time Machine-OS XCons:-OS X-Price-Only two USB ports-Lack of Firewire-No media card reader-No ExpressCard slot","Date":"February 22, 2009"}
{"Title":"a worthy overall update of the macbook line","Author":"Ben","ReviewID":"RFV6PZWXBIZVG","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had the 2.4 gb macbook for over three weeks (from Amazon) and I can feel the positive differences between this and my last generation black macbook, which developed a squeaking problem at the palmrest. The screen is a plus because the use of LEDs makes the sleep-wake process almost instantaneous and the images do look sharper (the glossy screen has not been a problem but I am only using it indoors) and the screen also bends back more. And if you don't take care of your computer screen like I did before, you will for this one because fingerprints and dust are very noticeable on the screen and bezel.I use it to primarily to surf the web and to do word processing for school. The start-up of most programs are quick like with the older macbook and if they are slow it probably has to do with the program because MS Word takes a long time to close and is the only program that has caused the beachball to come up multiple times. The iSight is the same as the old macbook and it serves it purpose so it is on-par and there is an ambient light sensor next to it which I found very intrusive and does not work so well when the light source from sitting by the window is at an angle so I turned that off after it dimmed and brightened randomly.The structure without a doubt is the reason why I got this macbook (besides the multi-touch trackpad which I dreamed would come to the macbook from the macbook pro and air). I am not afraid to stack things on top of it but there is a battery cover issue that other users and I have had where it takes precision to put it on or else there is a small gap and it makes a noise when moved. The keyboard is the same but I did do sometimes have a problem with the spacebar not responding and is probably an individual defect and I am bringing it to the Apple Store soon. I was saved multiple times by the back-lit keyboard while working in the dark but I would say normally it is unnecessary and I have it off to conserve battery.However, I am raving over the new touchpad because I actually use the gestures like 3-finger swipe to go forward and back on webpages even though only Safari supports it and Firefox has yet to include it in an update. And the speakers are VERY much improved because before with the black macbook I would not even attempt to play a video in a moderately loud room but quality could be better now that the volume is higher. The battery has been decent and I get 4.0 hours with multiple programs open and wifi.However, the polycarbonate macbook is still being sold and earlier this week (Jan. 09) it got an upgrade and the specs are now comparable to the lower end 2.0 gb aluminum macbook and it is for hundreds less so that option is very nice if your choosing between that and the inferior aluminum model. I would like to add that the polycarbonate one has a FW 400 port and the aluminum has a mini-displayport which I find a hassle because it means an extra adapter to carry around. Talking about weight, the new macbook is half a pound lighter and thinner which is great since I carry it with me all the time. The 2.4 model is definitely better with more RAM, backlit keyboard, and larger disk memory if the extra three hundred is not an issue.I agree that the OS is very important and Leopard has a smooth and aesthetic interface that works intuitively. The commands are great and I found them to be more useful than on my PC desktop and laptop but it might also have to do with the keyboard. Windows 7 (Vista that is stable and has compatibility) is around the corner and it looks very promising for PCs and also for Macs since they can run windows with BootCamp and VMware. I have Vista running on my desktop and I don't have issues with it but I am planning to go all Mac since doing the cross-platform have certain limitations and is also a hassle. I do get drawn to the looks of the Apple products so that tipped the scale and the new macbook does not lack in specs.I can easily recommend this product over the old macbook since it is sturdier, runs quieter and cooler, has a touchpad, and has a faster front bus 1066 DDR3. I don't like putting my laptop on my lap but if I have to I would not hesitate. I gave this five stars because overall it is a great improvement from my black macbook even though I stated some slight issues that I had with the physical product and some minor annoyances. There is great costumer service from Amazon and Apple to fix defects.It is a suitable time to buy a macbook because it just got upgraded but iLife 09 just came out and is not bundled and so you should hold out until then (sadly I bought it before it was announced). For PC users the decision is probably based on money since you will be paying premium and if the Mac OS is that necessary. (I also got it because my school uses all macs). If people have iphones and ipods the syncing process just feels so much smoother and I have an ipod touch and itunes does backs up much faster on my macbook than my PC. And for owners of previous generation macbooks, the new macbook is superior in all areas by specs and it deserves a hard look for people looking for a refresh.","Date":"January 22, 2009"}

I've always used PC's but recently have craved owning a Mac. Once the aluminum one came out, I knew I had to have it. I had reservations about it after reading all the negative things people had to say about the screen.But after owning it, I'll tell you that the screen is no issue. I think it's stupid how people try to compare the 13\" to the 15\" from horrible viewing angles. You're never going to use your laptop from awkward angles so why dwell on that? When you're looking at it straight on, the screen is bright and the colors are gorgeous.I also don't care that there is no firewire because my camera only needs a USB to load.My absolute FAVORITE part of the new laptop is the Trackpad. It takes a couple days to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, you will never want to use a mouse again. I promise. Scrolling up and down with two fingers is so convenient. With three fingers, you can flick forward and back when surfing on the internet. Flicking up and down with four fingers clears the page and also shows expose. You can pretty much use the trackpad to accomplish anything you want and you can do it faster than using a mouse. I guess the only thing you would need a mouse for is designing and drawing but I don't need those so I haven't used a mouse since I bought this two weeks ago.Something else I love about the Mac is how fast it loads when you open the screen. You know how it takes about 1 minute for a Windows laptop to get warmed up and running smoothly after hibernation? Well it's not like that on a Macbook. When you open the Macbook from sleep, it's immediately brightly lit. When you open a program, it doesn't take 30 seconds to think about it. It opens it within 3 to 5 seconds and is ready to go. It's how a laptop should be!I am completely happy with the new MacBook. The battery lasts longer than you'd ever need. I usually get between 4 and 5 hours. The keyboard feels great to type on. All in all, it's phenomenal. Unless they come out with super ridiculously amazing new technology over the next three years, I will keep this and simply add RAM and a new hard drive later. It's going to last a long time.","Date":"January 11, 2009"}

{"Title":"Super cool Macbook","Author":"Zane Auguste \"zulu alpha\"","ReviewID":"R2W8QE2QOU9BHS","Overall":"good","Content":"What can I tell the world about this Macbook..hmmmI have wanted to get a macbook for ages but never had the money, but I finally got it and have not regretted selling my Toshiba Satellite. The Macbook is indeed the real deal and feels like a real notebook; it is very light, slick, fast and just a beauty to look at.. an amazing piece of technology...Pros- It is very light and much faster on Vista than my Toshiba. (I use parallels virtual machine)- It works very well with the iphone... syncing my iphone with iCal, Address book and iPhoto is too easy compared to working on windows..- The unibody design is awesome, a smooth architecture which i have no complaints about.- You cant see the speakers but they sound good. a friend has the previous macbook version but this one sounds much better.- Mac has built in sensors for adjusting to different light conditions and its brilliant.- Your iphone headset works on the MB like on the iPhone, it pauses music in itunes, quicktime and skips to next song etc.. mac technicians are really good..- The computer is very intuitive. i cannot get my hand off the touchpad, had an external mouse but cant do the gestures with it so i only use the trackpad instead... four, three, two finger gestures are just BRILLIANT... This touchpad works exactly like my iphone and makes switching windows and SPACES a breeze...pich pictures to enlarge or shrink and make text larger in Safari.- You may have heard everyone talk about the screen, yes it is really nice under the right conditions, pictures look nice and bright indoors.Cons- The screen has a crazzy glare when used outdoors, the sun will totally spoil the fun.. you have to make sure you stay away from direct sunlight... Obviously you get this with other glossy screen laptops.. even my toshiba had this glare...- Definitely wish it had the firewire, that totally sucks- The battery life when i run it on wifi and surfing net, playing music etc was shy of the 5 hours mac had previously advertised..came to about 4 hours which is not 5 but still pretty cool.No more windows notebooks for me, from now on its Mac!!!","Date":"November 25, 2008"}
{"Title":"quick points to share","Author":"visterm","ReviewID":"R1PLP6VHS9E1IO","Overall":"good","Content":"+ Glossy LED display isn't as bad as I was worried about. Works just fine indoors. LED lighting easily overpowers any reflections you may have indoors (unless you're shining a flash light right on the screen). I haven't tried it outside, but I doubt it'll work at all. Then again, why am I trying to use my laptop outside? I usually like working at a desk! Or at least inside. Outside is for playing!+ OSX Battery life right on target (5 hrs)+ Form factor and size are really nice for the performance you get in this machine.  + Plays Command Conquer Red Alert 3 (under Windows) at 1280 by 800 with medium detail like it's nothing.  + Very nimble with multiple applications open+ Installs XP Pro and Vista just fine. Bootcamp drivers and support already on the OSX DVD, so you don't need to burn anything. Just pop in the disc after Windows is done installing.- Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter tricky to set up at first:  - OSX doesn't let you configure your MacBook to output to external only. You have to wake up or boot the computer while closed (power on, close display quickly!) with the external monitor plugged in for external display only while the laptop is open. If you unplug the Mini DisplayPort cable and plug it back in while in OSX, your laptop screen will turn on and stay on. Annoying.  - Windows does well with external displays thanks to the NVIDIA software that lets you set which display(s) you want to use, but the first few times, the drivers didn't seem to pick up the external display. Just unplug and plug back in. Eventually Windows XP Pro and Vista seem to \"learn\" your monitor preference with the external display plugged in. As an engineer, I have a hard time attributing \"learning\" to an OS, but that's what I observed. Vista seemed to learn faster than XP.  - Windows sometimes does not recognize the monitor after turning the monitor off for power saving. Again unplugging and replugging the mini displayport fixes this. Annoying.~ For what it's worth I use an Envision 20\" g2016wa2 monitor with the Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter. I had some problems getting the monitor to recognize the VGA signal reliably when running Windows, but after a software update in OSX that problem seemed to go away. May or may not have been related.- Screw holding hard drive clip in was easy to strip. Took a lot of pressure to start unscrewing, so be careful when you want to upgrade your hard drive.- Slot loading drive doesn't always behave: sometimes it won't swallow the disc, or eject it all the way out, or feel like it's still holding on to the disc after ejecting and you want to take the disc out. No worries though because you just have to push the disc back in, hit eject. If that doesn't work, you might need to power down so the drive resets. Annoying.- Battery life in Windows XP is worse than in OSX, probably because the power management drivers aren't as good. I noticed only 1:15 remaining after copying 5-10gigs of data with Wifi on and backlight about 20%. I may not have had a full charge though.- Stand-by not reliable in Windows, so make sure it actually goes to sleep before you bag the computer. I found out the hard way and pulled out a very warm metal laptop--cooled off quickly thankfully and continued running fine.- Touch pad in Windows is lousy: I use my right thumb to click touchpad buttons (in this case virtual button) while still touching the pad with my index finger, so when I do that in Windows, the cursor moves a little bit. You can use the tip of your index finger to do the click. Get an external mouse.NB: My Windows complaints are certainly minor issues for some people since this is a Mac, but some of us do like to be able to play PC games :)So overall, the problems I found certainly aren't show stoppers. It's a nice laptop given the performance, price, form factor, and capabilities.I hope you found my quick points helpful.P.S. Keep in mind I purchased the 2.0GHz model, which is plenty fast. In my experience the performance increase for the core processors isn't that huge when just increasing the frequency. It's the cache that'll speed up some things, but it's not worth the expense when Corei7 is coming out next year!","Date":"November 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Best Laptop I ever Owned!","Author":"A. Chan","ReviewID":"R1TRCQODDN1DAW","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the 2.0GHz model at the Apple Store and I have to say that this laptop is simply the best. Sure there are some cons, but the pros outweigh them.First is the new design, the design is so much better than the old design although the old one is still pretty nice. You can still get that one for just under a thousand bucks, but I think the new ones are worth the extra cash. I would give design a 10/10.Next, the weight. The weight is noticeably lighter than the previous MacBook. It weights 4.5lb, which is pretty good. I would give the weight 9.5/10. It could have been a little lighter for something like this.Features, yes there are lots. The iSight camera is great and the keyboard. I have to say that the backlit keyboard doesn't seem useful to me, as I am a touch typist who doesn't look at the keyboard much. Sure, it may look nicer, but I don't think it's worth the extra $300. The hard drive is 160GB, but after the formatting and OS X installed it was a little over 140GB. For $1299, Apple could have added a 250GB one. Of course, Apple has been known for high profit margins. I like how the SuperDrive is standard now. There are 2 USB 2.0 ports, but sadly Firewire has been removed. Although I don't really use it much, it would have been nice to have it there in case I needed it. The glass trackpad is a killer. It may take some time to get used to, but it's a nice touch. The multi-touch gestures are now in the MacBook and I find them very useful, especially the 4 finger gestures. For features, I would give it 9.5. The firewire would be the cause.Performance. The performance is lightning fast. Although the processor is now 2.0GHz, I don't think there's a noticeable difference between the previous $1299 model. One of the things that made this happen would be the RAM. The new MacBooks are packed with 2GB of DDR3 RAM, which has better performance compared to DDR2. The new graphics card also contributed to this. Apple now uses the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M. It's still integrated, but it can get up to 5x faster than the Intel GMA X3100. For performance, I would give it a 10.Some may find the glossy screen annoying, but I like it. I like how it's LED backlit now. Some users received the bad displays, but luckily I got the good one. For the display, I would give it a 9.4.The new aluminum enclosure is great and more durable than the previous plastic one. It feels more solid when it's carved from just one brick of aluminum.I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a brand new computer. The switch to OS X is worth it and I think people who want something durable which can last for a couple years would find this a good choice. Although the price tag seems a little high, you will find it a good thousand dollar spent.","Date":"November 1, 2008"}

{"Title":"DONT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS","Author":"Justin Gedeon","ReviewID":"R3ATPZYM0O7CJR","Overall":"good","Content":"If you have been reading the reviews on this laptop it has been kind of mixedLet me set matters straightI have been an avid Windows user and had a Powerbook G4 back in the dayI missed that laptop, so I decided to go back to a MacAnd I am glad I did.First off the main complaint is the screen.  Yes its glossy and yes it is going to be reflective (its made of glass what do you expect?), it does NOT affect usability to a degree, I use this in a well lit office building and it looks fine, in my house it looks fine, now maybe if I used it outside in direct sunlight.....I might have a problem, but seriously when and how often is that going to happen?The screen is great, the blacks look fine, they do NOT looked washed out.  And the screen is definitely not cheap.Second is the loss of Firewire, this mac is made to be an entry level laptop, Firewire is not widely used as much as USB 2.0.  So please stop complaining about it already, unless your doing some major file transferring dont worry about, USB 2.0 will do the trick, and if you want it then go spendan extra $200 for it.For the price you cant beat it, $989 for a laptop that is now called \"macbook pro\" for $1199?  I didn't feel like wasting money on just the name \"pro\"unless of course you want firewire and backlit keyboard and a little bit more battery lifeSo in conclusion.....get this mac.....save your money.....and dont worry its great for the price!!!","Date":"September 9, 2009"}
{"Title":"Perfect for my needs","Author":"William A. Fuller \"The Old Bald Dude\"","ReviewID":"R2OUWRSGOYYL16","Overall":"good","Content":"OK, my plan was to buy a cheap laptop for travel and instal some version of Linux, so that's what I started out looking for. Obviously, I just couldn't bring myself to do that. I'm a MacHead from way back, so syncing with the desktop and application compatibility became an issue. I needed small and light, and this is definitely small and light. I needed rugged and this is rugged. But, the keyboard is absolutely wonderful. I'm not a trackpad fan, but I really like this one. Took about an hour to adapt to it, and now I wouldn't have anything else. The display is beautiful. On of the best I've ever seen with one minor exception. The glossy screen is less than ideal in some lighting conditions. By and large, I can adjust the tilt of the display and it's fine, but the reflections can be a bit much. OTOH, in decent lighting conditions it's gorgeous. I spent way more than I intended, but I'm using this machine much more than I intended also. It's seen every bit as much action as my desktop since it arrived. The original plan was to use it only for travel, since I really don't much like the laptop form factor.

{"Title":"Review from a PC user","Author":"Travis Dockweiler \"tdockweiler\"","ReviewID":"R26X6GIURA8JTW","Overall":"good","Content":"This past \"black friday\" I was tempted to upgrade my current laptop to something smaller. My HP 17\" laptop was like a brick and I wanted something that did not weigh a lot. I originally was planning on spending half a grand on a cheap laptop. I guess I ended up spending much more!I first went with a Dell computer and liked it a lot. The price was great and it had the best specifications  I could find for the money. Unfortunately I had to return it due to some minor issues.The problem I had with making the initial purchase at first was the price. It cost almost five hundred dollars more than a comparable PC with even better specs. The hard drive was also too small and only came with 2gb of ram. Since I absolutely need to run some Windows programs, i'd have to also purchase a licensed copy of Windows.To me, 160gb on such an expensive computer is just not acceptable. It seems that Apple always has put smaller hard drives in their computers.  To be honest, until I opened and used my Macbook I felt really guilty for paying so much for a laptop. Generally I don't pay over a grand for a laptop and I build my own desktop computers based on what I need. After using the computer for awhile, my guilty conscience went away very fast.I won't lie about this. I loved this laptop from the start. When I first saw the picture of the new Macbook I thought it kind of looked ugly! In person it definitely is not. It's probably one of the best designed computers ever.First thing I did was upgrade to a new 500gb hard drive and 4gb of ram. Upgrading these is stupid easy. Anyone can do it. I'm so glad Apple has decided to make upgrading easier for people. My old ibook took over 2 hours and the removal of over 40 screws to upgrade the hard drive! This Macbook requires the removal of....ONE screw to access the hard drive.The price is the biggest negative. I feel it's worth paying extra for because of the build quality, but it's still too high. I think this laptop should be a hundred less.I'm not bothered by the lack of Firewire. I don't use firewire that much to really miss it that much. I do however wish it had some other high speed port such as eSATA. USB is just unbearably slow to me.I'm sick of Windows XP, so I decided to install Vista 64 bit version. No problem at all with this. Here is what is my biggest problem with Apple is. They love to nickle and dime you to try and sell you something bigger and better. Beforehand I did not know that Apple officially doesn't support Vista 64 on a Macbook. They want you to use an expensive Macbook Pro or Mac Pro. What's funny is that ALL the drivers still work, but they made it so that the installer doesn't run unless you run some DOS commands. When using this work-around every single device was working perfectly fine!My main computer is a PC desktop, but i'm liking this Macbook so much I might make the switch to Mac OS full time. I also installed Vmware Fusion and that really helps when theres a program I need to run that's only available on Windows. What's nice is that Vmware Fusion now supports Bootcamp partitions, so no need to reinstall or buy a second copy of Windows.The Macbook is pretty fast. No problems in this area. I'm surprised to be able to run Vista 64 in Vmware with no major problems. It's not fast, but works well. For me, upgrading to the 2.4ghz version was not needed. 2Ghz is more than enough for me. Three hundred for .4 ghz, backlit keyboard and a 250gb hard drive isn't worth it for me. For some it is, but it just depends on what you need.The display isn't the best, but in my opinion it's much better than most others. I actually have no negatives about the picture quality itself. You can view the display at an angle, but to a point. With my other laptop, you move the display an inch and it's hardly viewable. The glossy screen is of course annoying, but not big of a deal for me.At first I said that i'd never buy a Macbook because it had a terrible \"chicklet\" keyboard. Once I used it, it's perfectly fine. I should also point out that I absolutely HATE the wireless Apple Keyboard and find it unusable. Yet they're almost the same. Strange isn't it? This one is very good. Perhaps it's all due to a different typing angle. The trackpad is perfect. It's the best one i've ever used.I have not played any games with this yet, but I will soon. I'm sure it will play Half Life 2 and other games just fine. The shared video memory is kind of annoying, but it won't bother me much I think. I really don't know how much of a negative this is.The sound is somewhat tinny, but it's acceptable to me. My old HP 17\" monster had great sound for a laptop, but that was a laptop made for gaming.For me, this is just about as perfect as it gets. It just needed eSATA, a bigger hard drive and a lowered price. One hundred less and it'd be a pretty fair price. I will try to update this review with notes if I come across any problems.3-15-2009 UPDATE:I've been using this each and every day. Since day one I've had no regrets buying this despite it being way overpriced for the specs.The only negative i've had so far is using Vista 64-bit edition on this is a lot of trouble. It takes a lot of work just to get the Bootcamp Setup (inside VISTA)  to run properly. It would not unless I ran a few commands at the DOS prompt.Then the next problem in Vista is that the drag and drop does not work well. Luckily they had an update and it works just fine. It's just too bad it takes so much more effort than it should to double click in Windows with this trackpad. When clicking and scrolling the pointer moves around all the time in Windows, but not in Leopard. Strange.Since Apple advertises Bootcamp and tries to sell you a computer based on this feature, it's their job to make sure the trackpad works properly in Windows I think.Getting sound to work in Vista 64 was also a major pain. After trying four sets of drivers I finally got it to work. I downloaded some beta Realtek drivers off a website.My suggestion is to not bother with the 64-bit edition of Vista on this or just go with XP.The display is also just average. I'm not really impressed with it. It could be better. In terms of the quality of the LCD display, i'd give it a 7/10. What's strange is that the resolution in VMWARE Fusion would go past 1280x800 without actually having to scroll off the screen. I found that rather strange. Could the LCD display modes past this limit, but just not officially? Makes me wonder.My other negative is that the DVD-ROM is fairly slow at reading DVD movies. I wonder why very few Apple computers have 16x burners in them? Perhaps 8x is more reliable to them.I sure hope the next apple Macbooks have eSATA or USB3. USB 2.0 is just way too slow for backup.","Date":"January 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Review: satisfied","Author":"Valathil Premraj \"Premraj V\"","ReviewID":"R20HEDZBDZQQY1","Overall":"good","Content":"As a first time Apple Mac user, I have come to like the Macbook very well. A few minor flaws apart (which all laptops have), the Macbook is a solid purchase. I see many sore complaints in other user reviews, but if a lack of Firewire port or a display with whites/blacks not being as good is a problem for you, then this one's not for you. However, if you do not need a Firewire (I don't, my WD external HDD works on USB 2) and you get to decide the lighting conditions for use, then there aren't many other flaws. Don't let some biased 2 star ratings turn you away from the Mac - those ratings are by people who hate the new Macs just because of a lack of Firewire port or so.Upgrading RAM/HDD is childishly easy - I did not even have to watch those online videos to learn how. The only precaution you should take (as I did) is to take care of static before touching the Macbook.If you require ocassional Windows applications, get VMWare Fusion or Parallels - I'm personally on VMware and it works flawlessly with Windows XP. 2GB is not enough memory for Mac and Vista to work together, so if you plan to use Vista with VMWare/Parallels, buy more memory (Crucial is a worthy choice).Pros:Unibody design, Mac OS X, multi touch trackpadCons:Display glare (solved by not having a light directed AT you and your screen), minor Mac OS X problems common to any switcher, bottom gets hot after a few minutes of usage (because of the aluminium body)If you need the stability and 'just works' attitude of a Mac, this is the perfect purchase for you. Minor inconveniences can be expected with any laptop, but much more with Mac competitors (I'm sure I can point out much more flaws with a similarly priced Sony/Dell/Lenovo).","Date":"December 28, 2008"}

It has a refined look and feel, both the hardware and the software, and its performance and capabilities are excellent.Size and weight are perfect.

Great track pad.From power-on to web browsing: 45 seconds.  From standby to web browsing: almost instantaneous.I won't extol the virtues of OS X here, but they are numerous.Battery life is pretty good though somewhat less than advertised in real-world use.Sound quality from the built-in speakers is amazing for a small computer with invisible speakers.Highly recommended.

{"Title":"This computer is so solid.  Excellent Screen. Cool Touchpad.","Author":"Prime Reviewer","ReviewID":"R1ZOIBT03VQOPU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this MacBook to replace a white MacBook.  This computer is fairly similar in features and really is just what I want - not too big or too small.  I was worried about the screen after reading reviews that said it was too glossy and reflective.  The screen is excellent.  It is a step up from the last MacBook - which I thought was fine.  It is very bright.  For my purposes, the colors look sharp and vivid.The new aluminum case is amazing - it is noticably a little lighter than the prior model.  I guess time will tell, but it seems so damn solid and stiff - it is built like a tank as far as I can tell.  The original model's plastic would bend and twist a little - none at all with this case.  It feels as solid as the iPhone.The glass trackpad - takes a little to get used to - but it is another step in the right direction.  It has seemed to occasionally miss a click when I press down on it, though.  I like the different gestures - like using 3 to go back when browsing - it's cool how fast the brain adapts to make this second nature.It seems to be fast for all my admittedly low to medium intensity computing.I used the ethernet Migration Assistant to move everything from my old macbook - it was seamless, but did seem to take a little longer than when I've done it with firewire in the past.  I personally will not miss the firewire port - my camcorder is USB - so good riddance to a useless port (for me).To sum it up - if you're looking for a laptop of this size - this is a great choice - cutting edge design, built like a tank.","Date":"November 5, 2008"}
{"Title":"Sleek appearance, but has room for improvement; loss of some basic features","Author":"Tristan C.","ReviewID":"R3TX7NFJGWZVDO","Overall":"good","Content":"For my review I am going to organize this into positive and negative aspects of this new model based on my experience with both the old and new models, as well as a general understanding of what is available at this price point from PC manufactures (Dell, Sony, HP):Pros:1. LED screen, brighter, better battery life, better for the environment (no mercury).2. 1066MHz frontside bus.3. ~8x Better graphics performance than previous model.4. Easy access to hard drive.5. Half-pound lighter than previous model.Cons:1. No Firewire port. This means no target disk mode, or using minidv decks/cameras which require firewire. I feel this is a poor decision on Apple's part. This makes two of my hard drives useless without an adapter of some kind. One FW800 port would have been nice, and from an engineering point of view, they could have fit it in there.3. No HDMI port (yet to see this on a mac).4. No eSATA port (yet to see this on a mac).5. 5400 rpm hard drive. Better HDD performance requires $700 SSD upgrade on Apple's site. 7200rpm drive is something a tech savvy user can install themselves, though.6. Price. Base model is $1299.7. $1299 model does not have backlit keyboard. $800 Dell laptops have this.8. Display appears to have poorer contrast and viewing angles than previous model, even when using a Spyder calibration device. Also display is only available in glossy which some consumers do not like.Other points consumers should be aware of:1. Aluminum body; better displacement of heat than previous model, but body may dent easier.2. Button-less trackpad, people will have to retrain their muscle memory, but is rather easy to get used to.3. Display port replaces mini DVI port, but at least they have new adapters to DVI and VGA.Overall: I am generally neutral on this redesign. Very pleased with graphics upgrade, but equally disappointed by lack of ports, poor LCD display, and glossy only option. Bottom line, I can get a Dell Latitude for $800 with eSATA and Firewire--but, of course, it can't run Mac OSX.","Date":"October 27, 2008"}
{"Title":"Phenomenal transition from Windows to Mac and a quality investment.","Author":"Sarah Brown","ReviewID":"RWP0IZE0JNG4U","Overall":"good","Content":"I will be graduating in a few weeks and needed a good laptop for college and general use. I've wanted to try a mac for a while but always went with lower end pcs that, while they were affordable, never lasted more than a couple years of steady use without progressively declining in function and plummeting to eventual doom. Hoping to make a better investment, I got one of these on ebay that had been upgraded to 4gb of ram and Mac osx Lion. When I got it I upgraded to OSX Mavericks- Apple's latest operating system which is also free. It runs smoother than any of my windows computers did even when they were new. Don't get me wrong- I'm not anti-windows, I think it's a great operating system and I've used it for years; but I will say that even though this macbook is 6 years old it feels revolutionary compared to most current Windows machines.The keyboard feels very right and comfortable. I got one that had a backlight installed and I can't believe it can be so easy to type in the dark. I find that the way the keys are spaced apart makes it easier to keep the keyboard clean. I was surprised by how sturdy of a built this machine seems to have; it doesn't feel so delicate as I was expecting, meaning I'm not afraid to carry it around and use it in different places.The operating system is a great experience, especially coming from Windows. It feels user friendly and is in all, beautiful and streamlined; I can't really articulate it in a way that does it justice. It exceeded my expectations. The one thing that was a bit confusing to me coming from windows 7 is that there isn't a start menu- to access your files you have to use finder which will bring you to your folders and documents, pictures, music, videos, etc. Looking for files made me want to punch myself until I figured this out.I'm stunned by the quality of the built in iSight camera. It's more than sufficient for taking stills, having FaceTime or Skype calls, and recording video. The trackpad is also nice- I've never used one so large and it's very pleasant. Another thing that took some getting used to is that the most convenient way of scrolling a page is using the trackpad with two fingers. There's also no physical button on the trackpad- the entire thing just kinda is the button. Adapting to this also made me want to punch myself but that lasted all of 5 minutes. Now that I'm used to it I prefer it over a physical mouse or the other trackpads I've used.Overall, for my experience: basic stuff with the internet, youtube, music, communication, entertainment,schoolwork... this machine has been more than perfect and honestly better than I expected. Don't expect it to fill the gaping void in your soul, but if you have a longing to join the mac club but don't have a thousand bucks this is a very viable option.","Date":"April 21, 2014"}

There was only a very minor blemish on the top of the computer but when I added an outer cover for $10, presto it was brand new again. Another great thing about this computer is that it had already had many Extras installed such as word, excel, and power point that are all adapted to Apple format and at no charge. That was a major plus for me to be able to use for college and set up my presentations with ease. Also the shipping was quick and wrapped 4x is bubble wrap to ensure the products safety. I would deffinatly recommend and buy form this company again.","Date":"January 10, 2014"}

I have been a windows user up until now. I switched from android to iPhone about a year ago and love the apple iOS. So I decided I should try out the Mac line of computers, but they are really expensive so I looked to get one used. This style of Mac is powerful and has a great battery life. It looks just like the new MacBook pros and has a powerful dual core processor. This system plays video games and handles media better than you would expect. It was in amazing condition for being used as well. Really held up like new even though it is a five year old computer.","Date":"April 21, 2013"}

{"Title":"An excellent computer, has served me well!","Author":"Ciaran","ReviewID":"R2DUZ9YXQ06DRV","Overall":"good","Content":"I decided to write a review for this, even though it is old technology. There is a misconception around, that to have a pleasant computer experience you NEED to buy the latest product out there - this is simply not true. Even almost 4 years after its release, the Macbook 5,1 is still an excellent computer. I currently use it for word processing, surfing and even some pretty heavy photoshop, and with a few minor upgrades it had been quite the workhorse.PROS- Beautiful screen- Very portable- Decently fast processor and video card- keyboard is comfortable at short-medium periods of time- Multi-touch glass trackpadCONS- Aluminum cuts into my wrist after 3-4 hours of use- Screen developed a minor flicker after 1 year of use, expensive to fix- Airport reception is spottyMy recommendations:To keep this running at top speed, you are going to need two upgrades: memory and hard-drive. I recommend:1) Corsair 8GB Laptop DDR3 Memory2) Seagate Momentus XT 750 GB Hard DriveORMushkin Chronos 120 GB SSDORSAMSUNG 830 Series SSD.With these upgrades you will continue to enjoy a smooth computing experience. I am currently on the latest OSX Lion update, and am looking forward to Mountain Lion when it is released later this summer.Even in 2012, this is a great laptop for any regular user, and as I mentioned I even manage to do some decent Photoshop on this hooked up to an external monitor.Highly recommended if you don't have the cash to upgrade to the latest MB, MBP, MBA!","Date":"April 14, 2012"}

{"Title":"Pricey, but love it so far!","Author":"Gadget Freak \"Mike\"","ReviewID":"R1VO5FPB23HMT5","Overall":"good","Content":"Recent PC user yada yada yada.13 Inch Aluminum Macbook 2ghz - from a pure price to spec standpoint these things are about 2x as expensive as a comparable windows PC, but you also get more than just a laptop as well. What you are paying for is the packaging and design beyond the hardware; which is actually worth quite a lot.What I love. Aluminum design, trackpad, screen (yes I actually like the glossy screen and better than the white macbook), battery life, speed, bootcamp, easy upgrade-ability and just overall \"work of art\" styling Apple produces.What I don't like. Price, only 2 USB ports, only 2gb of memory (doesn't affect speed, but should be 4gb just be competitive at this price range) and hard drive size.What I experienced. New user to Macs and OSX so the keyboard takes some getting use to, shortcuts are confusing, dock is confusing, bootup is really fast, battery takes long time to charge but lasts a long time, and wireless is fast.Final. I really like this and don't regret spending the money. If you are looking for something different than a windows machine and a very well designed laptop, you will like this macbook. I look forward to learning more about this OS and hardware.","Date":"March 4, 2009"}
{"Title":"Simply the best laptop out there for the laptop user","Author":"Fernando Mendoza","ReviewID":"R2TP7Q9FVCS1SQ","Overall":"good","Content":"If your work depends on video production, get the Macbook Pro. Other that that, the new Macbook is all what you need for your daily life. Macs are the way to go, don't waste your time buying a Windows machine.I am upgrading from a Powerbook G4 12'', so I spent several weeks deciding between the early 2008 Pro's or the new Unibody Macbooks. I am very happy with my decision, this babies are FAST! and must important, they run cold and quiet. I have it since Jan 7th, and I haven't heard the fans turn on yet. Amazing. I've had 5 portable Macs and this is my fave.The trackpad is also a major reason for my choice. Once you get used to it, You won't go to the old one. Great invention from apple. Use one, two, three and four fingers for different actions. Wooo! excellent Apple!!The Screen: I was not sure about the glossy LED screen, so I asked a friend to bring her new Macbook and we compared side by side against Matte LCD and I DON'T WANT A MATTE LCD ANYMORE! This Macbook Glossy rocks. Colors are vivid and reflections are not an issue. Who works anyway with a lamp behind??? Get LED and save the earth.No Firewire: Maybe a shame for those video producers, but hey! MacBook pros are THE option.My last recommendation: If you can spend $300 more, go with the 2.4 backlit keyboard. Just for the keyboard it's worth it, and additionally you'll get more speed and more HD.","Date":"January 22, 2009"}
{"Title":"A great machine","Author":"rjweisberg \"rjweisberg\"","ReviewID":"R2RIS660VGX5G4","Overall":"good","Content":"I waited a long time to replace my 5 1/2-year-old G4 Powerbook 12\" because I was worried about the lack of Firewire (I make regular backups on a LaCie Rugged drive, so transfer rate is important) and comments about the glass screen having too much glare. But I needed to get a new machine this year and thought the Air would be too limited and didn't want to get the Pro, so I crossed my fingers and took the plunge . . .So far, in a week and a half, I haven't been disappointed at all. I used ethernet for the migration from my old Mac, it took 2 hours (which was acceptable). I bought a USB 2.0 mini cable and transfer to the LaCie drive is plenty fast. The screen is very bright and glare hasn't been an issue at all, and glass is much easier to keep clean. Of course, everything is much faster than the old machine. The backlit keyboard is great, and I love how light and thin it is.(One thing I encountered, and from message boards at various sites a few others have as well, when migrating from a PB using Tiger to the new Macbook using Leopard: the machine kept resetting the time zone for GMT. It took a little doing before I read about a solution which involved the Terminal and deleting a file from a hidden folder. Just something to mention.)","Date":"December 9, 2008"}
{"Title":"Beautiful Machine","Author":"Troy A. Forbis","ReviewID":"R1LPA0NRFC5TQF","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the MacBook 2.0 a little weary about what people were saying about the screen being glossy, darks being not dark enough, and bad viewing angles.  However, after buying it anyway, I found that those critiques are quite harsh and I have had a great pleasure using this mac with the gloss screen.  Yeah, the viewing angle is limited to being in front of the mac, but that is fine, you are usually in front of it when you're using it... Anyway, for those who still are scared about it, using an external monitor is always an option for the days you really need to become the biggest critique of your life and need something not glossy, and you need to sit at a funny angle, and you need the blacks to be really black!I'm loving it.","Date":"November 29, 2008"}
{"Title":"A great product made even better!","Author":"G. Sampson","ReviewID":"R18VIJGP0HZXEF","Overall":"good","Content":"I had the Black Macbook with all the specs as this one has (2.4 ghz, 2gb Memory, 250 Hard Drive). After Apple had announced this new notebook, I was in awe. I went out the next day, even though I just purchased my last MacBook a few months ago, and purchased this new MacBook. This notebook is much better than the previous version. Below are a few of my observations and some things I like (and don't).The Likes: The screen, though very shiny and mirror like, has a more crisp look and is brighter. Right when I first powered the device up I noticed the difference. Even though the processor is the same speed, this MacBook seems much quicker. This is probably due to the new graphics card. The new MacBook looks a lot better since it is made of aluminum rather than plastic. This makes the older MacBooks look cheaper, in my opinion. This one feels much more sturdy and better made. My two favorite additions are the light up keyboard and the trackpad. First, the light up keyboard is very helpful and looks really great. The glass trackpad doesn't look or feel glass at all. The whole trackpad is the clicker, which is something I do not use. I changed the trackpad settings to allow me to click just by tapping and right click by tapping with two fingers. This is really something that is better experienced than told. I am excited to try out the 24in LED display that Apple says was made for the Macbook (should be available November 08). Oh, and the sound on this MacBook seems so much better in this new Mac compared to the last version.Don't Like: Not happy Apple did away with Firewire for this device. I have an external hard drive that I'm not going to be able to use not that I have my new MacBook. I could use USB but that takes too long. The only other reason I would use Firewire would be to migrate my information from my old Mac to my new one. This was thought of by Apple, which was fix by users being able to migrate data using ethernet (I was told at the Apple Store that this is somewhat faster than Firewire). This is the only complaint I've had so far, but it's not that big of a deal for me. Although it makes me want to get the Time Capsule wireless hard drive Apple has (this was probably their plan!).If you've never owned a Mac, I say give this baby a try. You can install Windows if you'd like, and Macs are known to last a lot longer since they do not get viruses as much as other computers. This is a great device, but I hope Apple waits awhile to give the MacBook line a new upgrade so I can keep this device a little longer than I kept my last MacBook. Thanks Apple for a great a really beautiful upgrade!","Date":"October 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"Very nice, but perfectionists will always complain...","Author":"D. Nguyen","ReviewID":"RWW02FYAIIJLJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered the standard 2.0ghz aluminum Macbook and received it last night.  Immediately it was powered up and explored and everything works perfectly, although calibration of the display was not as easy as my PowerMac on a Cinemadisplay 20\".This morning after using the Macbook at work and turning it off, I noticed several white \"specks\" on the screen, one near the camera, another 1\" away from the left border at the center of the screen, and another 2\" diagonal to the right of the \"Macbook\" logo.  I attempted to first blow the specks off which didn't work, so I attempted to wipe it with the cloth included in the box.  That didn't work either.  It turns out this is dust BEHIND the glass.  I have owned several other laptops prior to this, and this is the first time I am experiencing a problem this small yet this obvious.  For a perfectionist such as myself, it is a pretty big deal (Amazon rectified the situation for me).Besides that, this laptop is probably the most solid feeling laptop I have ever felt.  It is heavier than my last laptop (XPS M1330 which was also solidly built) but slightly thinner.  The screen is super glossy, but so far I haven't had a problem with it.  The trackpad takes some getting used to because it is hinged at the top edge, so if your finger has moved to the top edge you have to remember to move your finger away from the top edge to actually click it.  The new multi-touch features for Expose and whatnot are cool, but I'll always take a real multi-button mouse over a touchpad anyday.Disappointed that I have to purchase a mini displayport adapter from Apple in order to use it with the Cinemadisplay rather than having the option of purchasing non-proprietary stuff.Overall, if you're looking to switch to a Mac and are willing to spend a little more than a comparably equipped PC, the base Macbook is the way to go.  The reason I didn't go for the higher end Macbook, I don't need the HD space (I have a 1TB PowerMac server at home) or illuminated keys, and don't do anything that requires .4ghz more power. If you really want a deal, look at the white (non-Alum) Macbooks...those are a steal lately!","Date":"October 29, 2008"}

After 6 months of reliable usage and ownership, my Macbook was dropped on its corner edge onto a marble floor from a kitchen counter height. My Macbook slipped out of a Booq laptop bag that was not properly zipped when I attempted to sling it over my shoulder. I swear I saw it fall in slow motion....After defibrillating my heart when it stopped at the time of the \"crunch\", I picked up the computer and restarted it. HALLELEUIA  - STILL WORKED! There was sufficient cosmetic damage from the drop that makes it unsightly for resale (1/4 inch chipped screen in upper right corner, dent from impact visible at the corner of the screen and the corner of the base). However, I don't intend to sell it, and I will use it until it dies, like my previous 12\" Powerbook workhorse.If you are comparing the aluminum unibody to the white polycarbonate macbook- the polycarbonate would've shattered from that same fall. The \"dent\" reflects the force absorbed by the aluminum enclosure. Spend the extra $100 to $200 for piece of mind.My point is, no one expects to have their laptop  \"drop\" onto a hard surface from a 4 foot height. Rest assured, the extra $$$ you spend to ensure your computer can survive accidental falls, is worth it.Aluminum unibody over white polycarbonate- this is a no-brainer","Date":"January 12, 2010"}

I had a Gateway notebook and was lukewarm about how I felt about it.  I decided to do research for about two months before buying another laptop since I was going to be using it for a few years to come.  I noticed that many people that I knew were very happy with their Apples and I was getting tired of always crashing and the way that my notebook (only 2 years old) was preforming).  I decided on the Apple because of reviews, consumer reports and I also personally went into businesses and tried out the computers.  I bought my Apple on January 6th, 2009.  I have been happy ever since.  It turns on and off quickly, it's design is sleek and sturdy, the keyboard is comfortable and even though I still have yet to explore it thoroughly, I do not regret my decision to go Mac.  I had been an advocate for PCs but this MacBook has changed my mind.  I love being a Mac.  I love my iTouch and all of the other stuff I got too.  It's definitely worth every penny that I paid.","Date":"August 17, 2009"}
{"Title":"\"I'll Never Go Back\" So Says Everyone Upon Buying the Macbook","Author":"carol irvin \"carol irvin\"","ReviewID":"R2ZJWC1OB1UUDJ","Overall":"good","Content":"When I see other people with their Macbooks out and about and ask them how they like theirs, I get the same comment every time.  Said with all the fervor of the new religious convert, they reverently say to me, \"I'll never go back.\"  Back is of course to a PC (shudder).  I gave my husband my former Macbook upon buying this one and he is now also muttering this as he is forced to use a PC in his workplace.  I was not always a Mac nut.  I thought that everyone was a bit batty about them and that Windows XP was just fine and dandy despite the fact that I was reformatting the hard drive every six months, getting rid of trojan horses, putting in one security program after another to protect it, defragmenting it when it slowed down, etc., ad nauseum.  This all ended with the Macbook as Macs are secure and don't need any of this fussing as it is all taken care of automatically within the machine itself.  I use one little program to clean it up about once a week and that's that.  I also have a three year warranty on each machine. I have used the warranty on my prior Macbook twice and the Apple Store's Genius Bar fixed one problem overnight and the other within 15 minutes, both problems completely covered under the warranty. My Macbook is very lightweight, never gets hot to the touch (a frequent problem with other laptops), works perfectly with every application whether graphics, audio-visual playback, word processing, ebook reading or web building.  I almost got the Macbook Pro instead but am glad I did not as it would have been too big and too heavy.  I use my Macbook all day long for everything and would not appreciate that extra weight or size.  I liked the Macbook so well that I purchased the iphone when it first came out without any doubts about it at all.  I also love it.  So yes, I have become one of those Mac nuts. i can't even imagine how I lived before having one, it is that integral to my life.  I notice the price has gone down since I bought my Macbook so the timing for new converts couldn't be better.","Date":"August 8, 2009"}

Amazing Quality & Functionality!","Author":"ActionAndAdventure!","ReviewID":"R2M5YO0VGM6ZJA","Overall":"good","Content":"Purchased my daughter's new Macbook 2.0 Ghz from Amazon. Excellent shipping & flawless delivery of perfect product as usual with Amazon. This particular computer is absolutely amazing. The \"solid\" aluminum body is a different creature altogether. Typical excellence delivered by Apple, and this LED display is more brilliant than you can imagine; superior to the LCD on the white Macbook, but both have their advantages (the LCD is not as visible from a side-view; security consideration). Nevertheless, this is the finest laptop line I've seen yet from Apple. They just keep getting better and better. If you're looking for a great computer for your kid going to college, this is the perfect size (not too large to carry, yet solid and rigid construction). I strongly recommend purchasing the AppleCare (3 year warranty), and Mobile Me, as well as the Mac Box Set (which has iLife and iWork - the later does a brilliant job of functioning as a Microsoft Office substitute), and you can use the remaining software (Leopard & iLife - which is already installed on this computer) on another Apple you may already have.Strongly recommend this computer. Excellent in every way.","Date":"May 2, 2009"}
{"Title":"Perfect for Me","Author":"NiteOOwl \"Linda\"","ReviewID":"RVH3HUXQYLDRP","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this laptop after doing much research since Apple's product line has gotten increasingly large and complicated.  There was also some of the \"do I really need this\" since I have a relatively new 20\" iMac G5 and an older G4.  I was concerned that the screen wouldn't be large enough, but wanted something small and lightweight enough to carry with me when I'm traveling.  Well, this fits the bill, weighing only 4-1/2 lbs.As other reviewers have stated, it's taken me a while to get used to the trackpad also and I'll admit to just ignoring the many features before finally starting to use it as designed.  Now I love it!I was also concerned about the speaker system and was right.  For me, it's not good enough.  A pair of small headphones makes all the difference in the world, though, and I'm considering connecting it wirelessly to my Bose Lifestyle, but it's not a \"have to\" to get good sound.Also, I neglected to notice in the Description that it doesn't have a Firewire port and that gave me some difficulty in transferring information from the G5.  In using a USB port for that task, the computers recognized each other but the G5 kept searching for another computer, and an hour on the phone with Apple support didn't solve the problem, so I was given a Case No. the very first day.  I finally just manually transferred the information I wanted, leaving all the accumulated junk.  The next day, I realized what the problem was:  the G5 had been looking for my Wii, which was not turned on but is wirelessly connected to my network.My first computer was an Apple IIe in the early 1980s and I've had many more since then; some I liked more than others.  This is one I would highly recommend.  The weight is good and the screen size is perfectly adequate.  If my eyes need a larger font, that's easily done.  It has quickly become my primary computer.","Date":"April 21, 2009"}

I have been using it for gaming, web surfing, and document moding. I will be the first to admit that I am probably not using this thing to its fullest potential, but I have a pretty good feel for the ins and outs at this point. I did notice that several programs did not respond or function in ways that I needed them to, but this was easily fixed with some searches and a few downloads including the Mac version of OpenOffice. To be fair, I have done the same thing with every Windows computer I ever used. The computer also dual-booted an old copy of Windows XP without any incident, so I can run a couple of programs that do not support Mac. There is only one dark stain on this otherwise excellent item: the power cord.After a few days using this product, I notice the central block of the charger cord was very hot when I used the laptop and charged it simultaneously. This was almost too hot to touch, and I still worry about scorching my couch with it. When I went online to investigate this, I found two disturbing facts. First, this is not unique. This is how most of the cords come, and no one seems willing to place it on anything overly flammable. Second, this can lead to a short life for my charger, and a replacement will cost about $80 and have the same problem. Most people seem to consider this a yearly expense for the book, but I am not thrilled about it. I love my Macbook, but if I had known this ahead of time, I may have bought a different model. Please consider this in your production decisions.Conclusion!Pros: Good Battery Life, Better performance than the components should provide, NOT Vista, Easily Customizable, No Noticeable Performance Glitches, Dual-booted XP perfectly.Cons: Needs more USB ports, Very Bad Charger Cord!","Date":"April 16, 2009"}
{"Title":"Beautiful Piece of Machinery","Author":"David G. Kent","ReviewID":"R36RMX8ARLAAEH","Overall":"good","Content":"I can't say enough about how much I love my Macbook.  It is a beautiful piece of engineering.  The laptop itself is incredibly solid, there are almost no moving parts on the case, and it has no squeaking, give, or any other little annoyances that exist on other laptops (like weak-points in the case, seams that are coming apart, etc). The unibody construction is simple amazing.  This *will* sound ridiculous, but even closing the lid is more satisfying than with other laptops.  Finally, I am in love with the trackpad.  It is incredible.  I used to be unable to control a computer with a trackpad and I carried around a mouse with me everywhere.  The trackpad on this macbook, though, has eliminated my need for a mouse.  I don't know if it the gigantic size, the mouse button integrated into the pad, or all the awesome multi-touch gestures, but the combination of all of that has eliminated my need for an external mouse with this laptop.As far as the hardware inside goes, the computer is very fast, the graphics are great, and it has a nice big hard drive.  The screen itself is lower quality than the Macbook Pro's, but this just means that it has narrower viewing angles.  When viewed from straight on by a normal person (meaning not a professional artist or graphic designer) it looks just as good as the Pro's screen.The software is great.  It's a Mac.  There's not much more to say.  Just switch now and leave behind the frustration of computers that don't wake up from sleep when you open them, \"driver incompatibilities\", having to choose between 32 and 64 bit versions of your OS, etc.  I used to be a PC fanatic that thought Mac people were crazy, and now I'm a full-fledged Mac prosthelytizer.

At first, I wasn't sure if I should get the new MacBook or just replace my white one with the same one I had, but after talking to a few people and reading reviews, I decided it was worth a couple hundred bucks to go for the new one. Happy I did! The new design really is beautiful and feels great. Lovely keyboard and screen. I haven't experienced problems with glare on the super-shiny display as some have, I love the brightness and crispness of it. Best of all is the new track pad technology. I had always used a mouse with my previous laptops as the old trackpads that required clicking with the thumb and dragging with fingers never felt right to me. This is so easy and very intuitive. My only complaint is that sometimes the tapping just stops working. This is sometimes just a few-minutes problem but other times requires a reboot.I remain a happy Apple customer, and recommend this gorgeous new laptop wholeheartedly.","Date":"February 14, 2009"}

{"Title":"This is a great laptop","Author":"Adrienne Leverette \"Adrienne\"","ReviewID":"R3OQH528H1KQ9B","Overall":"good","Content":"I have used Windows exclusively since Windows 95 was introduced. I currently own PCs that run XP and Vista. I never really had much trouble with Windows, but I decided I wanted to give Mac a try. I bought the 2.4GHz Macbook and the first thing I did was upgrade the RAM to 4gb (very easy to do.)This is a great computer. It's beautiful and it does pretty much everything I used to do on Windows, but much faster.My favorite features are the multi-touch trackpad and the Spaces feature in the Leopard OS.  At first, I was concerned about the glossy screen, but it hasn't been an issue.In my opinion, Mac's Leopard operating system has a better user interface than Windows. However, I need Windows for a couple of programs so I installed VMware Fusion 2 to run Windows XP SP3 on my mac. VMware fusion is great because you don't have to reboot into windows (you can use Bootcamp, but you'll have to reboot into Windows). Also, Windows XP runs better on my macbook than it did on my PCs! I can run my windows apps side by side with my mac apps. I am currently running the Windows version of CorelDraw and Photoshop along with my mac apps with no noticeable decrease in performance.I also installed Windows 7 using VMware Fusion, and it runs great.I highly recommend this computer.","Date":"February 6, 2009"}
{"Title":"Ditching your old PowerBook? This is a great replacement","Author":"steve_oakland","ReviewID":"R36GO4D3HV8SPQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've bought this computer to upgrade from my old 2003-era G4 PowerBook. For those of you with G4 PowerBooks, you're in for some nice upgrades:1. The screen is much, much brighter and despite how some users feel about the \"glossy\" look, it is much better than the dimly lit PowerBook screen.2. It is certainly fast enough to run streaming video from Youtube, and [...] without choking. I can run many more applications simultaneously without any performance issues (though I do have 4 GB memory installed in my model).3. The large trackpad is a big plus, especially if you don't tote around a mouse.4. No more noisy fans running constantly. Under the same usage patterns as the PowerBook, this runs quietly and handles some big computational work smoothly without heating up. (I occasionally do some bioinformatic work on this computer).Downsides:FireWire: Other users have complained about the lack of a FireWire port on this model. I have mixed feelings about this... I do not ever plan on using a FireWire device on this computer. However, I have found using the FireWire supported Target Disk Mode useful in the past to rescue data from a crippled Mac. But I now back up data more routinely, and I doubt I would even use TSD.Headphone Hiss: I use headphones with this computer often. Unlike the PowerBook, the headphones produce a background hiss. I have read elsewhere that this is an issue with the sound card of the MacBook and not an issue with headphones or unshielded cables. The hiss clicks on and off as the soundcard activates and deactivates when sound is sent to the speakers. This may or may not be fixable through software updates in the future. Until then, it is only a minor annoyance.UPDATE 10/2/09: HEADPHONE HISS ELIMINATED THROUGH UPGRADE TO MAC OS X 10.6 (SNOW LEOPARD)","Date":"February 2, 2009"}
{"Title":"Ideal performance for size.","Author":"Praet \"-Praet\"","ReviewID":"R2VIVE5C46H917","Overall":"good","Content":"I have never owned a Macintosh product of any kind. The 13 inch MacBook fit all the specifications I wanted in a laptop including size and battery life. I was wary to make the change but the transition has so far been smooth. This includes my own customization of the laptop preferences and finding applications that fulfill my needs when the ones that come with it do not.The screen works great. I have no problems with the glossiness in any way. Once the machine is on, I pay no attention to reflections most of the time. This may be due to the fact that I tend to avoid using it in lighting situations that would provide the most reflections. The auto-dim/brighten feature due to light sensitivity is nice. I am not sure it has a significant effect and it does seem overly responsive to small light changes.Most displayed images and texts are sharp and colorful enough for my taste but it seems like some people may be annoyed by it a little bit. There does appear to be some slight blurring of text at certain positions on the screen, especially 'l's, 't's and 'f's where there is the horizontal line on each of those letters. There does not appear to be that line for 'l's in the default font but in some fonts it is there and you may notice the slight blurring.Also, the max resolution of 1280 by 800 was at first surprising. I was expecting at least one more step up in resolution but it is still suitable for how I use it and the screen size. As I think about it now, an extra step up may make it more difficult to see clearly on because of the screen size. I do not think of the screen size as a con, if I did I would have gotten the 15 inch MacBook.The trackpad works wonderfully in the native OS and I have no problems with the use of the gestures. The gestures do not feel in any way awkward or cumbersome to me. I have never had experience with that kind of interaction on a trackpad and the gestures feel reasonable for the actions that they perform. I find that the trackpad is the most accurate one I have used among a few laptops. This includes response to my own changes in finger movement speed, the tap clicking instead of using a button, and the scrolling gesture which I use the most among the gestures available.The sound quality from the built-in speakers is fine. I cannot even find the speakers as of now. If you want high quality, get some headphones. Also, the microphone works surprisingly well. Again, if you want high quality, get your own microphone.I cannot comment much on the built in camera as I have barely used it. It does appear to work satisfactorily if you want to use it for webcam chat programs.I have used Bootcamp to install the Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit version on a separate partition. The partitioning and installation process is easy. The only issue I have with Bootcamp is the fact you cannot adjust the size of a partition once it has been made. If you only use Bootcamp and want to change the Windows partition size, you must delete the partition and restart the whole process. There may be a third-party application that you could use but I personally think it should be a feature within Bootcamp.The trackpad is significantly harder to use in Windows, but keep in mind this is a step down from what I consider to be the most responsive trackpad I have ever used. When I say 'significantly', I mean only that I can tell a difference. It is not an extreme difference. It is still quite usable. You do not get to use of most of the gestures as they are dependent on features within OS X Leopard; though the scroll gesture is still there and works well enough.The Windows install was for playing games only. I did not want to leave them behind simply because I switched to a Macintosh. I also will most likely be using it to run SAS which is a statistical software. I am not sure if it will work or not at this point, but I am hopeful considering everything else works fine. The drivers are alright except for the 9400M graphics card not having newer drivers released by nVidia last I checked and some audio stuttering every few minutes. This does not represent a strong annoyance to me as it only lasts a few seconds. The stuttering is at a rapid rate so not much noise gets lost to it. Any voices are still audible and understandable as is the music and other effects.The graphics are surprisingly good. Left 4 Dead and Bioshock both run fairly well. I have most options put to their highest settings except for the resolution and some texture settings. This is to ensure a smooth framerate which the MacBook is capable of in those two games. Do not expect max settings in newer games when purchasing this laptop. I have no problem with this. I am not the type of person that needs the best graphics. One final thing, games take a lot of energy and the battery life is greatly reduced when playing them. This is the case with all laptops and you will want to plug it in if you play graphic intensive games.In general, I really enjoy my purchase of the 13 inch MacBook. Of course it does look nice but the main plus is how slim it is for the performance I get out of it. The battery life is excellent. Most features of the laptop are perfectly satisfactory or exceed my expectations. I do not recommend it for power users who want the best performance, people that have tons of peripherals (it only has two USB ports), or hardcore gamers that expect top quality graphics capabilities. It seems to be an excellent general use laptop but may not be the best choice for those who have a specialized need.","Date":"January 13, 2009"}

When the new macbooks came out, I thought, well, it runs windows and linux as well as os x, so even if I don't like os x, I can still run xp on a new laptop.To put it very simply, this is a very good laptop. I couldn't believe the size of it, it's by far the thinnest laptop I have ever owned. The aluminum body is so sexy people actually stop by at my office to stare at it. I gave a presentation using iwork (amazing software by the way) the other day and there were more questions about my laptop than about my presentation.The only problem I have had is with the trackpad. It seems to freeze every now and then and tapping to click/scroll doesn't really work well for me. I had to disable tapping and the apple update didn't really fix this problem for me.But besides that, great screen, built in video camera and great software. os x is so nice. using spotlight for one thing is one of the highlights of my day.

{"Title":"Very speedy, incredibly quite","Author":"Johnny \"jb-in-nc\"","ReviewID":"R17GSKTTEYN0M4","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first Mac and it has so many great points. Most impressive are it's speed and how quite it is when running. When I run any website with flash video on my 2 year old desktop computer, the fans immediately begin to spin at full velocity. The Mac manages to play flash video without breaking a sweat, and without so much as a sigh. Safari loads web pages crazily fast. Some pages load instantly, such as GoDaddy, even if the page has not been cached. Very impressive.The wireless-N receiver in the MacBook works great and manages to pick up wireless signals with very high reception that my friend's recent model Dell laptop doesn't even recognize (even though it has a wireless-N receiver also).I love the new trackpad. It makes navigation very quick and can be customized to suit your likes. By default, you have to press down on the track pad to click, but you can change the behavior so that only a light touch will click, very similar to how you click on the iPhone. Scrolling with two fingers quickly becomes second nature, and using 3 fingers to navigate backwards in the web browser is handy. A two finger tap brings up the secondary menu for where you click. Perhaps the funnest trackpad gesture is using the four finger \"throw\" to send all the open windows flying to the edge of the screen to reveal your desktop. Another four finger \"pull\" brings them back into view, and another \"pull\" will bring up Expose so you can view all open windows and choose the one you are looking for quickly. Even though I've never owned a Mac before, I've tested out past editions that had the click button at the bottom of the track pad, and I think it's removal is a positive thing and a little bit of playing around with the new trackpad gestures should convince old users of the same.Spotlight makes launching an application a split-second process, and I much prefer it to using the dock. Spotlight also lets you speedily find a file you are looking for by typing all or part of it's name. And searching within the Finder (the Mac's equivalent to Windows Explorer) makes finding the file you are looking for a very easy and satisfying procedure. If only Windows had this feature. I think it is a basic and obvious thing to have in any operating system.My MacBook immediately recognized the shared parts of my Windows network without any work on my part. I was pleasantly surprised by this. I wish I could say that my Windows machine was as quick to recognize my Mac on the network.The built-in iSight camera also works wonderfully. My only gripe at all so far with the Mac is that using my iPhone (which I already had synced with my Windows machine) is not a very user-friendly process, and it is not immediately obvious how to make the iPhone work with multiple machines. For a company that prides itself on user friendliness, they should really work on this aspect of their software. Overall thought, I highly recommend the latest edition of the MacBook.","Date":"December 6, 2008"}
{"Title":"Quality and Freedom","Author":"William Bledsoe","ReviewID":"R3OCP5JNF8O3JS","Overall":"good","Content":"I grew up using PCs, but after Windows 8, I'd had enough of Windows, and Microsoft for that matter. I switched to Linux and while I do love it, it was and still is lacking compared to Windows and OS X. It's catching up fast, but more time is needed. After years of this 'do it yourself' journey, I decided to make the switch to Mac. From my understanding Mac was much more simple and polished than competitors, and after receiving this MacBook, I can completely confirm this. This MacBook, being about six years old, wouldn't have too high of a standard to meet for those of us familiar with tech and its tendency to become obsolete and sluggish quickly, but it far exceeded my expectations. Upon opening the package my mouth actually dropped at just how thin this thing is in person. The stock photos do it no justice whatsoever. Until I got it completely out of the packaging and examined it closer, I briefly worried the seller may have sent me an Air or a Retina Pro by mistake. With the lid closed, its probably close to two iPhone 5's on top of each other in thickness. Very thin device. Its not a MacBook Air, but it is extremely light by laptop standards. It is as you probably already know, crafted out of a single block of aluminum. This makes for a beyond sturdy and solid feel. I bought mine refurbished (And again, this computer is about 6 years old.) and the only cosmetic issues other than insignificant scuff and small scratches were a VERY SMALL dent on the back corner and a stripped hard drive screw. I can't stress enough how well this machine is built. The overall design is tough meets stylish, the keys give just the right amount of pressure when typing, the display, while not Retina, is high definition and unless you decide to kiss the display, you won't spot a pixel. I notice a lot of people complaining about the all glass construction of the display, but I couldn't be happier with it. I don't plan on ever buying a matte screened laptop again. Glare will be present in obvious locations: out in direct sunlight, with a bright lamp CLOSE behind you etc, but I find that a few taps of the brightness buttons quickly corrects this minor hiccup. The trackpad is an absolute marvel, all glass and very spacious. To be honest it almost feels like I'm using a tablet in terms of responsiveness and smoothness to the touch. I always loved using a mouse, even on laptops, but with the MacBook its not only not necessary, its actually a downgrade from just using the trackpad. You can do all non keyboard navigation on the trackpad alone and it is every bit as easy and fun as using the touchscreen of an iPad or iPhone. There are more gestures and personalization options for the trackpad than I have time to cover, but if you are on the fence about trackpads, look up the MacBook trackpad in action, you'll love it. Although the design and overall beauty of this machine (It is an Apple product, right?) is nothing short of remarkable, the inside is equal if not better than the outside. Mine was shipped with Apple's latest OS 'Mavericks' and it is hands down the best OS I've used in my entire life. The best way to explain it to someone who has never had a Mac would be to imagine an iPod or iPhone morphing into a full computer. It is to the traditional laptop what an iPhone is to any Android. It's smooth and fast in ways I never heard even the biggest Apple fanboys brag about. I actually didn't notice how slow a lot of the 'little things' were on Windows and Linux until I switched to Mac. For example; navigating sites like FaceBook and Twitter, playing YouTube videos, opening larger applications. All things that took a few moments to really get smooth and lined out on my old computers, my old machines were by no means slow outdated, the overall smoothness just isn't comparable with the Mac's. These actions were near instant on my MacBook. I can only imagine how speedy it would be with an SSD. It's a very connected device, if you have decent internet and especially if you own any iOS devices, you will fall in love with the features. Send a text through wifi, FaceTime, download apps very similarly to how you would on an iDevice, sync with your iOS devices flawlessly, it just blows me away. It does everything the average user would want, plus a lot more. It's difficult to review this entire device without writing a book as it is absolutely packed with features. As someone who has used a little bit of everything on computers and has predominately used HP and Dell hardware, the MacBook is single handedly the best computer I've ever used. It does all the casual stuff very well and does more intensive tasks exceptionally well for its power and age. I don't think I'll ever buy any other brand than Apple when shopping for a laptop in the future. I purchased mine from the Gordy's Gadgets store on Amazon, and the quality and dedication I received from this seller has been the best I have ever have with any seller, online or in person. He answered all my questions quickly and informatively and upon hearing about the screw issue (I wanted to upgrade the hard drive) offered to send me a replacement MacBook and the required tool for upgrading it. He shipped it out and got it to me well before Amazon estimated and helped me the entire time with my questions and concerns and was extremely polite and helpful the entire time. His store is to other sellers what this MacBook is to other laptops- a shining example. I can't express enough how satisfied I am with this MacBook and Gordy's service. I give this MacBook a MUST BUY for anyone shopping for a mobile computer and from my own overwhelmingly positive experience, if you don't see Gordy's Gadgets in stock WAIT until they get one in, his cheerfulness and support is worth the waiting. Very happy with my purchase, thank you Apple and thank you Gordy!","Date":"May 29, 2014"}

{"Title":"Good for those who don't multitask that much","Author":"nny63","ReviewID":"R164B0BF10DPKW","Overall":"good","Content":"I enjoy my new Macbook. I've had it for a month now, and it's so well-preserved over the years (I bought it used from a seller here on Amazon). For the first few days I was dazzled by the specs (the ambient light sensor, the backlit keyboard, the glass display, the aluminum unibody design, the battery life), but after a couple days I started to notice that it was quite sluggish whenever i played flash video or opened more than one program or ran safari for too long. I debated switching from Lion to the OS X below. I even thought I might sell it or send it back, but I ended up uprgading the RAM to 8 gb first just to see (apple released an update for this computer that allows it to take up to 8gb of RAM). Now it runs super fast. All the programs open fast. If you are a multitasker like myself, know that this computer cannot and will not multitask effectively with anything less than 4gb, although I think 8gb is JUST right since you only get like 5gb of it available to you (apple getting away with highway robbery, per usual). 2gb of ram is okay if you're simply using word or itunes or something. If you like watching Youtube or movies or listening to music while surfing the internet, I would say go 4gb or above. I honestly think the 2gb model isn't worth it.","Date":"September 26, 2013"}

{"Title":"Serious Upgrade - A Completely New MacBook","Author":"Steve H \"books911\"","ReviewID":"R1Q1L6DLS1JN9R","Overall":"good","Content":"While I have had several desktop Macs, with Intel processors, my notebook for the past few years had been an aging, though gorgeous, 12-inch Powerbook G4. With the release of these new Macbooks in October 2008, I knew it was time for me to upgrade to a notebook with the performance of my iMac.Design - One of the most striking elements, for me, about thew new 13-inch MacBooks is that Apple has went to the aluminum enclosure, for this consumer priced machine. The aluminum notebooks from Apple have always looked, felt, and held up quite nicely, my Powerbook is a testament to that. Now, the aluminium form factor is available starting at $1299.This particular notebook is perhaps the best feeling of any notebook I have held. Upon opening it from the box, I was immediately impressed. While feeling light and sleek, it feels sculpted from a block, so very solid. This must be due to the new unibody structure that Apple is touting. I don't know how they do it, but I do agree it feels wonderful on your lap and looks great on your desk.Performance - The performance of the new MacBooks have really taken a step forward. While the Core 2 Duo Processors are about the same speed as the last generation of the plastic MacBooks, the graphics in these notebooks are on another level. The new Nvidia graphics in the notebook is keeping up with my aluminum iMac's graphics, impressive for a notebook! The magazines that have reviewed the notebook say the same thing. The graphics performance on this Macbook is 3-5 times faster than the previous Intel Integrated Graphics. This is a solid step forward.2 GB Memory - This is a sufficient amount, for the type of applications many people will run with Mac OS X. I use 4 GB on my iMac, but 2GB for my notebook is fine. If I want more later, I can swap it out.Hard Drive - For the first time, the hard drive is easy to access in the MacBook. This is great! Not only can you upgrade to a faster or bigger hard drive, when you need to someday, it will prolong how long you can use this notebook. Hard drives are one of the weaker points in a computer due to the physical moving parts. With this notebook, we have easy access to the battery and hard drive, so if everything else keeps running, we can keep this notebook going for years, something that makes me feel good about the investment. I have wished user accessible hard drives on a Mac notebook, and it finally happened.Super Drive - It's still nice to be able to watch and burn DVD disks.Software - The lastest version of Mac OS X Leopard is included alongside iPhoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, etc. A lot of great programs to get the new Mac users going.Connections - I have several Firewire devices, so I was sad to see Firewire removed from the MacBook. However, USB has been so much more successful that you can understand Apple's move. Thankfully, most of my firewire devices are USB compatible as well.Overall, I seriously considered the MacBook Air, when it came out back in January. However, I'm glad I waited and that Apple released this 13-inch Aluminium MacBook. To me, it feels even better in your hands and on your lap than the Air, plus you get a significantly faster computer with user replaceable battery and hard drive. While the glare on the glass screen is terrible compared to the matte display on my old Powerbook, images and movies do look a lot better and \"pop.\" I'm glad I decided on the MacBook. I haven't had any issues, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a new notebook.","Date":"November 20, 2008"}

Funny thing is, it's actually the crappy viewing angle and overall dullness of the display that bugs me.  Over the past couple of days I've used it quite a bit and my eyes are actually hurting me - when I got back on my 4-yr old iMac G5, I immediately, physically felt it was a more pleasurable user experience b/c of the display.So I'm considering a return even though I actually love everything else - the keyboard, the new, bigger trackpad with the really cool and useful gestures, the overall design - this thing is a pleasure to use and look at in every way - except at the display itself.  The other reviewers are correct in qualifying this as literally a disgrace - a flagrantly cheap, poor quality display on a flagship Apple product.  Not good.","Date":"November 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"White Macbook 2.4 GHZ \"VS\" Aluminum Macbook 2.4 GHZ","Author":"T. A. Dinh \"iAmAlexander408\"","ReviewID":"R2JR63PLI9TQQA","Overall":"good","Content":"Edit: Also the Firewire issue I've been hearing about. I'm a Business Major students and see no need in using a Firewire. I've never used a Firewire in my entire life. I mean harddrive fits just great in USB ports and also camcorder and other stuff I never dealt with that stuff. If I also have to, I'm sure I can do it without the need of Firewire. So I say let Firewire go because I a business major student don't need it.What I'd like to say is that I read all the reviews on the new Macbook on Amazon and Cnet before buying my new one. I was still convinced to buy one because I think in my point of view its alot better overall than my last Macbook (White, 2.4 Ghz, 2 GB ram). Although they increased the price of the notebook, I feel that its still worth the price because it is nicknamed \"Macbook Pro Mini\".First of all the display issue. I notice is looks alot better than the old Macbook, like so much brighter. I don't know why people are complaining about the screen so much because I can see just fine on my Macbook everything, no glares whatsoever. I just put my desktop background as the big Earth and all black and I don't see any bad in this. I mean it looks just great. I would think that maybe if you go on the Macbook outdoors alot it may be an issue but I'm a student and I do most of my work indoors (classrooms, library, home). Go ahead to the Apple store and you'll see display is much brighter and also the screen looks just so great that you want it even more. I have no problems with the display but if your eyes don't like it, well, myns do and many others who purchase it too.Next the Macbook is almost like a Macbook Pro but smaller and not as powerful. The Macbook now has backlit keyboards, it has a much better stronger graphic card (5x better wow), and also the front but has gone up from the 600s to 1000s (DDR3). Also the battery life has increased and weight decreased. These feature you'll find on a Macbook Pro which the cheapest before were around the $2k range. Now you can get one for less (student discount for me =]).Graphic card I can notice is actually much better. I played some FPS and RPG games and I notice its so much better than my old Macbook. The FSB is noticeably better and my multitasking skills in the Macbook is alot faster now. The battery life I can notice lasts that extra half an hour longer than my old one, and the half pound weight is just great. Even the thinner Macbook fits even better in my backpack.I put this Macbook inside my Brenthaven case (great case by the way) and the old Macbook took up a big space of compartment but now because I have a thinner one its much roomier inside there now so I don't have to worry about all my books squashing the Macbook.Also the big deal probably, the aluminum. The aluminum is much more powerful and because its a big deal about the Uni-Body closure. They were right. I think this aluminum feels better than the Macbook Air. I don't know but carrying this thing you feel more secured about it getting scratches or squashed by a heavy book. This is like a Superman armor compared to the old plastic one.I carry my Macbook everyday to school and I have to walk up this gigantic hill to class everyday. Knowing that the Macbook is made of aluminum and won't get hurt in my backpack makes me feel alot more confident (I don't throw my Macbook in the backpack by the way, there's a special compartment they made that fits the Macbook exactly perfect fit and padded =D )The touchpad glass is so great. I mean the button pushing thing is hard at first but its been two days and I love it so much. Also the new Multi-Touch gestures on MACBOOKS are so awesome now. I mean I can do so much things now without having to reach for the keyboard or moving the trackpad as much. The expose with the four fingers trackpad is so great. I mean this is going to change my notebook experience, Apple is so great to design these gestures it makes it easier to use the computer.Overall, the screen isn't an issue, but the price is =[. But I can notice it being much faster, and also I can see that the Aluminum is great on the Macbook. This Macbook is exactly like a Macbook Mini, if your a student or someone who doesn't need all that powerful graphics but wants to be almost on par with it. This is the Macbook for you. I don't regret my decision in buying this Macbook at all.","Date":"October 19, 2008"}

{"Title":"From PC to Macbook - GREAT laptop!","Author":"Hot Young Mama","ReviewID":"R7INX8X8UKUCY","Overall":"good","Content":"Like many of the reviews posted here, I am also a converted PC to Mac user now (been using windows since Windows 98 came out).  Just before purchasing my macbook (which is the 2.4 ghz model with 128 gig SSD), I had a Dell Laptop with almost identical specs.  For the PC laptop, within the first day of using it, I got the B.S.O.D. (blue screen of death, aka the blue error screen) 2 times.  After many failed attempts dealing with the cust service (we all know how great Dell C.S. is.. absolutely horrible), I decided to return my Dell laptop and get my first ever macbook.  All I can say is that I've had this laptop for 2 months now and have not had ONE problem with it.  I updated all of the software updates with no problems at all, installed all of my mac programs that I bought with no problems, and pretty much coasted through everything else.  In addition to the problem free experience I've had with this laptop, the programs open up almost instantaneously.  There are no holdups at all and the laptop DOESN'T get hot by just browsing the internet (you guessed it, the Dell laptop got hot just after starting it and use it moderately for 5 minutes).  So, if you're at all curious which Dell laptop I got, it's the studio xps 13, aka M 1340.So, in conclusion, if you're on the fence about getting a macbook, I HIGHLY recommend jumping over and getting it.  I also highly recommend the solid state drive.  It helps with opening up the programs much faster.  So, what are you waiting for...  Check out what you've been missing!","Date":"April 2, 2009"}

{"Title":"Phenomenal Laptop","Author":"Mia Chong","ReviewID":"R1PJRL2WUFPC1I","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros: - GREAT OS- Lightning fast- Light-weight, sturdy unibody design- Attractive design- Dashboard- Incredible screen- Great trackpad- Good battery life- Keyboard is excellent- Magsafe adapter- Excellent iSight Camera- Boot camp availableCons: - Glossy screen quite reflective- Screen is fingerprint prone- No FireWire- Small amount of game functionality- Battery not as good as advertised- Distant longing for physical trackpad button- Multi-touch gestures not entirely spot-onSummary: The new Macbook. It's incredible. With faults. That's all I'm going to say for my introduction. Read on.Physical SpecsThe product physically is very sturdy, thanks to the unibody construction. Normally the chassis would normally consist of various small parts. So instead of taking a small piece of aluminum and adding more aluminum, Apple has taking a big piece of aluminum and subtracted from it. Thus creating a sturdy, yet light laptop. I have heard that the aluminum interferes with internet connectivity issues. I do have to say, unfortunately, it is true. I put the Macbook and my old PC laptop side by side, and the PC was able to pick up better frequency and more networks.Now for the multi-touch trackpad. It is made from glass, but it feels like there is a covering on it that doesn't nearly have the friction of glass. Clicking and moving the cursor is very easy and enjoyable, with the very large surface. Right-clicking can be done with by clicking with two fingers or by clicking one of the bottom corners after being manually set. It should also be noted that only the bottom 3/4 of the trackpad is clickable.The multi-touch gestures are fun to use, but are truly unneeded gimmicks that could be done easier with a click.I'll just go through the gestures now.There are 2 finger gestures:The first is scrolling with using two fingers by swiping your fingers vertically or horizontally depending on the page.Secondly you can rotate a picture using two fingers apart and rotating.The third gesture is holding the control button and scrolling vertically to zoom in on a page.And there is one 3-finger gesture:Swipe with three fingers to navigate. You can do this to go forward or back on a page, or changing a picture.Lastly there are 4-finger gestures:Swiping vertically upwards allows you to clear everything off your desktop.Swiping vertically down launches Expose.Swiping horizontally in any direction lets you change and view your running applications, which can also be done with command+tab.On the bottom of the MacBook there is a panel that allows for easy access to your battery and hard drive. This will be handy to many people.The keyboard is just like the Air, with the spaces between the keys. This creates a very nice typing experience, and are backlit if you purchase the 2.4GHz model.A major letdown by Apple is the omission of a FireWire port. This is very disappointing to many people, but doesn't affect me at all. Nowadays the average users don't use FireWire too much. Although I do see this as a major problem for professional applications.There is also a battery life indicator on the side of the base that glows green to show the rounded percentage of your battery.Software and PerformanceOf course the MacBook has the great Mac OS X Leopard software.It is very fast, and has good security.The battery life is advertised to have 5 hours of battery life, but Apple obviously means not being connected to the Internet, and having no applications running. You'll probably get about 4 and a half hours with Safari and other apps running. Unless you have a lot of apps on like me, then you'll maybe have 3 and a half to 4 hours.With the NVidia graphics card, the screen looks pretty good, as do games. I do have to admit, though, the new MacBook Pro screen looks better, especially with blacks. Still, games really pop on the gorgeous glossy screen, unless you are in a bright area. The glossy screen of course attracts bad glares and many noticeable fingerprints. Still, if you are indoors or someplace with low light, the glossy screen is perfect. I mostly use it inside, so I wouldn't trade the beautiful glossy screen. Although for those coffee-shop typing folks, this could be a deal-breaker.Other than these things, Mac OS X is the same, really.ConclusionIf you have purchased a MacBook anytime soon, then I would not suggest you purchase this one. Most of the differences are the physical attributes, and the software is pretty much the same.If you are new to Macs like me, then I would DEFINITELY suggest this phenomenal notebook computer. Of course it does have it's faults, truly I have never used such a simple, enjoyable computer.","Date":"October 23, 2008"}

In the end I opted for the smaller MacBook. I travel quite often overseas. I like to keep my carry-on luggage as light as possible, so every pound counts for me. The lack of Firewire also kept me on the fence for a while. One other factor was the screen. I have read a lot of reviews in which people are not satisfied with the screen. If possible visit an Apple Store or check out a friends MacBook to decide for yourself. For my purposes, mainly internet, word processing, and spreadsheets, the MacBook's processor is more than capable. I've found that it rips and burns DVDs approximately 3 times faster than my Deskptop (Mac G5 Dual 2.3GHz).I am extremely happy with my MacBook as my second computer.

{"Title":"MacBook, Better Than expected","Author":"Sheldon Hyacinth Leriche \"Leriche loves his M...","ReviewID":"R1ENDG3FHZ81P","Overall":"good","Content":"After having a dell xps m1530, and then switching to the mac book, the most noticeable difference is the fact that i leave my home, with only the MacBook, no wires, no charger, no chords no  cables not even my wireless mouse. I  just slide it in a very small umbro bag. The size and weight plus the battery life, makes it so convenient to carry to basically anywhere. I get 4 - 5 hrs straight from my macbook, more than enough time to be away from an area with an electrical outlet.The track pad, is not only for use, but to play. The multi-functionality of the track pad, makes work look like play. Zooming, scrolling, switching between windows or applications, rotating pictures to name a few, all done by sliding your finger or a combination of fingers on the track pad.The screen/display is stunning. We took for granted the fact that we remain seated around the table watching a movie:  and the table was round. It is only after a while my friend observed that normally we would have to get up to get a good viewing angle, which is straight in front of the screen. The display adjusts to the amount of lighting  in the area, excellent idea.You use the keyboard effectively without accidentally touching the track pad. The back light is one very important feature, and should have been standard just like the battery in all laptops. you just need it all the time. The back light also adjusts to that amount of lighting in the area.The macbook gets warm, and not hot, which is excellent.The operating system is excellent, and graphically based. I don't need to be a genius to have an idea what that picture is saying. Most of the technical and complicated information has been removed or hidden rather, so all i see are icons. To install or uninstall and item simply drag the icon in the appropriate location.The Negatives i have noticed : the \"two\" USB ports it has, are placed ridiculously close to each other, making it near impossible to have to things connected at the same time (may be it was deliberate, to get us to purchase the other little gadgets). I only supports stereo (one output) straight off the book (u need a gadget).  I am still learning the operating system and thus i am seeing there isn't much that can be done to customize the overall look of the system , apart from changing the background and colors of the names under the icons. May be there is more that i need to learn (and mind you, i will).There is a lot more i can say but will end here. what i needed out of a portable device, was battery life, durability (it is made of aluminum you know), and simplicity, while fun, but does not compromise on power and versatility. I did not even talk about the dash board, which as the name would suggest, provides quick easy access to many things on your system.If you have the money get a mac, its only a few hundreds more, and did i mention that you can run windows on there, so you can run two operating systems for a few hundreds more.","Date":"June 1, 2009"}

Since it is built on a UNIX foundation you don't need to worry about messing with the registry.My only problem that I have with it is that I should have got the one higher up.

There isn't too much to add.So here were my big concerns and conlcusions after one month of ownership.Is it hard to switch to a Mac-  very very easy.  I used firefox on a PC, now I use firefox on a Mac.  With all the cool gestures its even better than firefox on a PC. Mac version of MS office is better and easier than MS Office for Windows, which is weird considering MS should really make its own OS version better, but I guess it has more to work with on a Mac.Picasa- now available for Mac.utorrent- now available for mac.Glossy screen- I hate glossy screens, but the mac 13.3 glossy screen is fine.  Never once had any glare ever. On a comprable pc glossy screen, glare was so bad I returned it.  So the screen is actually one of the best I have ever used, even compared to my samsung 24 inch desktop monitor.mini displayport- get an HDMI connector from monoprice. That way you can have video out to your HDTV for hulu and such.  But does not carry audio- so you have to also have a audio cable of some kind out to your speakers or tv or such.I guess thats it.  Otherwise, what can I say.  After 3 failed windows laptops, from hard drive crash, driver issues, overheating, cracked monitor hinge etc,  I finally got a mac.  The funny thing is when I use a pc now,  I realize that a loading time of 5 or six seconds to start a program just doesn't happen on macs.

{"Title":"Best Decision Ever!!","Author":"M. J. Delaney","ReviewID":"R3HBN8ETPDDXFP","Overall":"good","Content":"I was think about buying a netbook and decided to go with this instead, best decision I've ever made. I upgraded my hard drive to 500gb for $100, and my ram to 4gb for $100 through Ramjet. I've heard of some people having problems with adding other than apple ram, but so far the Ramjet has worked flawlessly. The only real reason I would have got a higher model macbook would be for the backlit keyboard, but if you're a half decent typer you shouldn't have any problems even in the dark. The 13in screen has been perfect for me. I think a 10in netbook screen would have been a little too small, and any bigger than 13in would decrease the portability, although if I was someone purchasing this for my primary computer and would be using it at a desk a lot, I would consider the 15in or 17in macbook pro. Battery life has not been a problem, especially if I'm just surfing. If I traveled a lot and watched a lot of movies or was using CPU intensive programs it might be a problem, but car inverters and other travel adapters are cheap. The only thing at all I wish this had is a built in card reader.  on a last note I would recommend upgrading the internal hard drive over buying an external, I got my Western Digital 500gb from newegg for around $100, and changing it was easier than upgrading the ram.","Date":"February 9, 2009"}

Great design, just a beautiful machine.  Best notebook I have own.  Fast, runs windows and Mac OS, has built in mic and camera, upgraded video graphics chip is fast.  Love the magnetic power adapter.  I don't have any firewire peripherals, so missing a firewire port is not an issue to.I love the multi-touch track pad.  I spend most of my time using it to browse the web.  This multi-touch feature makes scrolling around a joy to use.  I appreciated it more every time I have to use my girlfriends HP notebook that doesn't have this feature.My only concern from reading the reviews is about the screen quality.  However when I went t to Apple store to see check out the product, the screen looked gorgeous.  One of the nicest picture quality I've seen.  Maybe I am not an expert in this area, but I am just not able to tell the difference between the macbook screen and a high quality screen.  I suspect most people are the same.  I would recommend going to the apple store to check it out before buying.This product is designed for easily upgrading the DRAM and Hard drive.  Since I occasionally run Windows XP in virtualization, 2 gb of Ram doesn't feel like its enough.  Its nice to know that I can easily upgrade the ram when I want to.","Date":"January 9, 2009"}

Right now I am sitting by a window and I can see a bit of a reflection but it's on the black part surrounding the screen.  The screen does get fingerprints on it.  I never see them when the laptop is on, only when it's sleeping or off.  I just clean it every few days with the Apple cloth they give you. I like the little details like the battery indicator on the side.  The iPhoto is great.  I am completely organized with my photos now.  I do wish that iOffice had came with it.

I have been a staunch windows user for all of my life and never thought I would be a Mac user in my life. There are two factors which made me switch to Mac. First was my despicable experience with Vista and second fact was the cool Apple `I am a Mac and I am a PC' TV commercials. Yet I was a bit skeptical and spent several hours watching video tutorials and clips on Mac OS X on Apple website and reading through hundreds of users review online. Finally, I gathered enough courage and bought one from local Apple store. First couple of days, I thought I made a bad decision. Then I thought thousands of positive user reviews on Mac cannot be wrong and gave it another try. Within a week I was breezing through my Mac and 2 weeks later I could not be any happier that I made the switch. The user experience is just fantastic. It is an awesome product and I cannot believe I have been living without it for so long. There is in no way that I am going back to Windows again. If you are planning to buy a Mac, make sure you watch the tutorials on Apple website. It will make your switching a lot easier and a pleasant experience.

{"Title":"Strong, but...","Author":"E. Beyrouty","ReviewID":"RAKY7FWT2JGYV","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm the lifelong PC user that decided to give Macs a try after great iPod, iPhone experiences. I needed a new computer, the new macbooks just came out and had good reviews, so...great. I decided to give it a shot because I knew if I ran into trouble I could always run Windows.At first, I went all Mac. I bought the Mac version of Office and Quicken (the two client programs I actually use) and quickly saw that they are awful. The online reviews warned me but they truly are bad. Functional but nowhere near the PC counterparts. I couldn't port my Quicken history, which has more of my time invested than many would consider normal. That's why I purchased Vista. At first I installed it in bootcamp. Easy process but once I got the drivers installed I saw that it wasn't a clean port. The glass \"buttonless\" trackpad functionality wasn't mapped properly. The highlight-drag-n-drop was goofy, the right click functionality was spotty, the scroll speed was jumpy. It was all there but it was driving me nuts.I'm sure Apple will eventually fix the drivers (if they make it possible to install Vista, they should get the kinks out of their drivers), but this is why I decided to wipe it clean and install Vista inside VM Fusion (virtualization software). Very easy, great functionality (trackpad now works like it should) and having everything inside one desktop is great. This setup makes the entire system a little slower (still workable) but it defeats the purpose of the hardware and price points.I was able to install the new versions of Quicken and Office (both great) and finally have the functionality I want. After all was said and done (apple tax, 2 versions of quicken, 2 versions of Office, Vista license, Virtualization software), I'm sure I doubled my cost compared to a decent Windows based laptop. It's a sunk cost for me but hopefully this helps others. If you are hardcore Quicken / Office users, stay with the PC. Vista is fine. If you can stay in the Mac OS entirely, this is a great product. The rating would have been higher if Macs had decent 3rd party software ports or if Apple would have provided decent Bootcamp drivers for their new hardware.","Date":"December 14, 2008"}

I would love to seen the price at $1499 because of the 2gigs of ram, I think if it would of come with 4gigs of ram at $1599 that would of been perfect. Next is no firewire! I can see why no 800 port but 400 come on, if apple is killing firewire just do it!Now the things I like. The screen is LED! when you open the macbook its up and no waiting for the bulb  to go to full power. The  trackpad will take sometime to get used to, but its big, fells very nice, and smooth! keyboard is big, backlight is bright, I do miss the num keys. The superdrive is quiet and fells the about the same speed.I have 2 things that I love. The macbook does not get HOT! I'm writing this and the temp is 115F , and the fan rpm is 1999 so quiet. Next is the weight it is 4.5lbs I don't know why you would buy a macbook air now. for 1.5lbs you get superdrive, changeable battery, up to 4gigs of ram, bigger hard drive, and it fells almost as small as the macbook air.","Date":"October 21, 2008"}
{"Title":"Nice Machine but Expensive and Some Flaws; Caution for Windows Migrants","Author":"SanjeevP \"Bottom Line\"","ReviewID":"R69H51523YQ2Q","Overall":"good","Content":"Having used several Windows notebooks over the years - ThinkPad, Compaq, Dell, Toshiba, Sony VAIO - this is my first Apple notebook. Although, I have lusted after Mac OS for years, it wasn't practical because most of my work software is Windows. Now, the ability to run Windows on Mac notebooks has changed that and it is possible to have the best of both worlds. Amongst the Windows notebooks, ThinkPad has always been my favorite, and this MacBook is replacing ThinkPad X31.MacBook is fast, feels very solid and sturdy, thin and has bright LED display with vivid colors and fast graphics. Some people are complaining about the glossy screen; but I found glare a problem only with bright light facing the screen. Battery life is decent, about 4 hours. Self adjusting screen brightness, depending upon ambient light, does not work very well and I had to turn it off. Backlit keyboard is excellent. You will like large multi-touch track pad after you get used to it. Two finger scrolling and right click are very convenient. In lot of ways Mac OS is superior than Windows, and especially Vista. Mac OS applications are lot more fun and easier to use, not to mention less crashes, freezes and viruses and malware.Being a migrant from Windows, I miss dedicated PgDn and PgUp keys; it also lacks numLk, Home, End, and Del (forward) keys. Lack of Firewire can be a problem if you do not have another computer with one and need to use it for camcorder etc. Card reader is also absent and it is not easy to transfer camera pictures unless the camera also works as a card reader. Neither is there an express card slot or 3G modem. Cost is definitely a lot more than similarly equipped Windows notebooks. Mac versions of Quicken, Quickbooks, Dragon speech and several others programs are not as good as Windows versions which I have been using under Windows and Fusion. Theoretically you can use Windows on the MacBook but in practice many files saved in one operating system cannot be opened by the other operating system. For example, Windows cannot open many of my photos, documents and spreadsheets saved in MacBook (\"Disk read error\"). Potential Windows migrants really ought to look before they leap into the Mac OS.I feel the ideal weight for a truly mobile computer should be 2-3 lbs and screen 12 inches. 13.3 inch screen has a big footprint and 4.5 lbs is slightly heavy. MacBook Air is not as powerful, is expensive, has smaller hard drive and lacks ports. And the main reason to get MacBook Pro is if you need firewire port and do lot of graphics intensive work. I loved my ThinkPad X31 with 12.4 inch screen, 3 lb weight and all the ports. For me the ideal computer would have been a ThinkPad X200 with Mac OS; I figured that in absence of that, this MacBook could be the next best choice. But so far, I have mixed feelings about trading ThinkPad for MacBook.","Date":"October 24, 2008"}

Sony could not guarantee I'd ever get the disks, so I took the laptop back and bought this macbook (first mac ever)What sold me on this was the boot camp application which allows the user to partition the hard drive and then load windows onto it. I MUST have xp, so this was the initial selling point.  I also thought the computer was  very well built.Well, using boot camp and an oem version of xp pro, the installation was FLAWLESS, and the directions provided by apple were very well wrtitten!.

I can't believe I had been resisting it for so long - what was I thinking? My 13 inch aluminum Macbook has definitely improved my life!I'm a commercial/editorial photographer, and manage content on a high traffic automotive blog site ([...]) for a living. This Macbook shuts down & wakes up in about 1 second, whereas I'd have to constantly wait for my PC to shut down/start up. This is a big deal to me, because since I multitask like crazy, I'm constantly running late for things and ALWAYS need to leave immediately for meetings, or get last minute info (like mapquest directions, etc) real quickly before I leave.I love how my aluminum Macbook is small, thin, lightweight, stylish, and surprisingly rugged due to the aluminum exterior. I travel ALOT (last year I took an average of 2-3 trips per month) across the USA and internationally, and let me tell you... having a capable, light laptop is a huge deal. Especially one that can do all the things my Macbook can. Photo and video editing, managing playlists, syncing to my iphone, creating webpages on iweb, blah blah you name it.I love that my Mac uses SPACES (it's like having 4 desktops, and keeps things uncluttered.) It lets me use Firefox on desktop #1 (I manage the site through Firefox), Email/addressbook on desktop #2, Photoshop and plugins on desktop #3, and I can have iTunes blaring out my favorite music, while I'm looking through the folders on my Terabyte external HD in Finder (like Windows Explorer) on desktop #4. Spaces keeps my desktop and my mind organized; I love it. I can run my 80000 tabs in different browsers, and I can keep work related tabs/windows separate from random browsing stuff like Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, Yelp, Amazon.com, etc. Perfect if you have ADD like me.Try THAT on a PC. Even a new one. It would explode. I have 2 Toshiba Satellite laptops on my desk, and my Macbook. The smaller, thinner, more efficient Macbook is what I use for most of my web/internet/photoshop tasks... and my POS Toshibas are now only used for dumb, mundane tasks like copying photos off my CF cards to an external drive, checking MS Outlook email, and FTPing files from my external HD to our server.

I have a Time Capsule that two computers share internet connections with. I figured the Macbook airport would just catch the signal and I'd have internet access automatically. It didn't quite happen that way, so I'll spare you wasting your time. At some point while accessing the Time Capsule parameters to join the network, it will prompt you with a screen that says something like, \"Do you have any devices, firewalls, or routers connected to the machine (or something like that). You must click yes (if you have a Time Capsule), then it asks you to restart the machine, and press \"continue\" afterwards. I kept hitting restart on my MacPro instead of restarting my Time Capsule. At the end I unplugged/plugged the Time Capsule and the MacBook picked up the signal %100.

The screen is bright and comes on instantly.  It is way cool.If you haven't run Apple software you are in for a treat.  There are lots of good applications to chose from--including MS Office for those who need mainstream word processing and spreadsheets.This is a rock solid, stable operating system that never crashes.What you don't get with a Mac.  A Virus.  A machine that needs constant tweaking and fussing.Buy one and you will never regret it.I own a Mac Pro, Mac Mini, and new this year in the family, a MacBook and and iMac.","Date":"December 12, 2008"}

{"Title":"I wanted to love it....","Author":"D. Bannister","ReviewID":"RP0AQ58E6J6KP","Overall":"good","Content":"As an early adopter of Macs back in the day I was looking forward to this computer. While I work at the office on a Vista Dell machine I decided to go Mac for my travel laptop because nothing impressed me in the Windows world as much as the MacBook did.So after two weeks here is what I like:1. Fit and Finish. No laptop in the Windows world comes close. The aluminum unibody is an engineering marvel and a thing of beauty.(The new laptop coming from Dell very likely will rival the MacBook but we will have to wait and see.)2. Keyboard. A real strength. Very easy to work with. Has good feedback and nice key travel. Silent but responsive. Very very nice. Backlighting on the 250 GB model is very nice but kind of gives a spooky glow as the light leaks out between the keys. Horror film fans will be happy as they wonder what entity is trapped in their keyboards.3. Touchpad. Very intuitive and responsive. A little hard to click but leap years ahead of the current one button or two button pads.4. Very quiet. Truthfully I don't know if it even has a fan. And warm but not hot to the touch. Makes lap work very easy.Here is what I don't like:1. OS. Seems clunky. Also I have had more restarts on this computer then I ever had with my Dell with Vista.2. Screen. Something is fuzzy about it. The settings are there but the clarity is not. Can't put my finger on it.3. Software. Inconsistent. But I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised by the file compatibility between iWorks and MS Office. The computer is limited in software but that is what I expected.4. The magnetic power connect really sticks in there. Sometimes a real pain to disconnect as the end is too small to grab and you end up pulling the cord which you know is going to break sooner or later.5. Speed seems lacklustre. Takes some time to boot programs. Shouldn't. With Vista you blink and you have Word. In the Mac OS you yawn and it might be there.Neutral:1. Battery life. Sure it shows you have five plus hours when you begin with a full charge but I think you would be lucky to get three in real world usage. Power meter drops off pretty quickly. But what do you expect? If you believe the hype then I have a bridge in Brooklyn you can have cheap.Overall:1. Solid machine and feels great in your hands.2. Well balanced for carrying and using.3. OS, Software, and speed average.4. Display is OK but it seems to lack crispness. Most screens in the Windows world really pop. Like air conditioning in North American cars Windows laptop makers know how to create amazing displays. But this display is wholly average. Something is missing.5. Very good machine. But not great. I still look forward to working on my Dell with Vista at the office. And that is exactly what I wasn't expecting to happen.My kids had played this machine up so much I expected it to be great. But then again they bought iphones and then promptly broke or lost them and went to Blackberries - so what do they know? Laptops like cell phones are not so much devices as fashion statements for them. In the Apple aluminum Macbook you have haut couture in looks but sadly only a Buick under the hood.It's a buy but don't expect too much.","Date":"March 10, 2009"}

{"Title":"Five very solid stars -- plus a few things you should know.","Author":"Maine Writer \"David\"","ReviewID":"R3BCSPU4KK5OZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Who'd have thunk that Bill Gates would be bribing people to pan the new MacBook on Amazon?  Yet, the proof is in the pudding.  The new MacBook is, frankly, the best consumer laptop Apple has every sold, and I've owned just about all of them.  It's also the finest consumer laptop out there, but, I suppose, I'm repeating myself.  Yes, there are a few folks who elevate the lack of a FireWire port to the kiss of death, or complain about the \"quality\" of the screen, even though it is the same quality screen that made its appearance in the last iteration of the MacBook -- and, more importantly, it's a damn fine screen that no reasonable user could find fault with.  It's bright, vivid and clear, backlit by LEDs that truly make it quick to light up, easy on the eyes, and a beautiful display for watching videos or slide shows.  Those who complain are a lot like the folks who could be convinced that tap water is actually Norwegian glacier drippings, or that hand-rolled oregano is a joint.  Finding fault with the screen is just plain silly.  But, don't trust me.  Truck down to your local Apple store and take  a look for yourself.  It will really blow you away.  And as for FireWire, it would be a more versatile laptop if it was included, since a lot of older camcorders are FireWire only, and, as of yet, there is no FIreWire to USB 2 converter available to consumers.  My guess is that there will be in short order, but that's for another day.  So, if you really want to do FireWire downloading to your Mac, get an iMac or a MacBook Pro.  Simple as that.But, here's why those petty complaints don't mean a tinker's cuss. First, this is a rock solid laptop, pressed from a solid block of aluminum and virtually scratch-proof.  It's expensive to produce this kind of light rigidity (no one else machines their laptops from aircraft grade aluminum), but it turns out to be indispensable for a workhorse portable. The MacBook opens and closes and feels like a fine Swiss watch. Going from the MacBook to any of its competitors is like going from fine Japanese or German sports car to a Chevy Impala -- the kind with chintzy appointments and cheap doors.  The kind that folds up in a crash.  Are you going to pay a bit of a premium for that kind of quality? Sure. But, even with this kind of off the charts fit and finish, the MacBook only costs $1299 -- and you can get an Apple certified refurbished unit for hundreds less.  But here's the real beauty part.  Apple laptops hold their value -- just like Hondas and Toyotas. I trade mine in every two years to get the latest and greatest, and usually get more than 50% of the purchase price in a trade in.  Try that with your Dell or HP.  They'll laugh you out of the computer store, and then the best you'll be able to do is to try to sell it as a commodity product on eBay for parts, maybe.But, apart from the terrific screen and off-the-charts build, you get an amazingly solid operating system that virtually never crashes. Sometimes an application with quit on you, but even that's rare.  And the OS X just keeps on keeping on. It's a thing of beauty, and the next version (Snow Leopard) is designed to take advantage of the MacBook's architecture to achieve blazing speed.  Not that the current version (Leopard) isn't plenty fast. It is. And then you have software programs have no equal in the Windows world for both elegance and ease of use. Just give OmniGraffle or Keynote a try if you don't believe me. Sure, there are some specialty Windows programs that aren't available for OS X.  No problem.  You can run Windows on your MacBook -- either by directly booting into it, or via fine emulation programs like Fusion.  Note: If you want to run heavy duty games, you probably should drop a few hundred more bucks for the MacBook Pro.  But, since most of those games suck, and are better off being played on a console or desktop computer, why bother?Seamless integration with your iPod or iPhone, the great, exclusive software, a crash-proof operating system, and a beautiful design of both strength and lasting beauty ... don't listen to the MacBook bashers here. They truly have no clue as to what counts in a laptop or what consumers both need and want.  Frankly, I think they're just looking for attention, and to rally around some irrational clinging to their Windows laptops which they probably got on the cheap (you get what you pay for) or paid too much for and got little in return.","Date":"January 30, 2009"}

{"Title":"I'm a PC & a MAC.","Author":"L. Olson \"olsonl13\"","ReviewID":"R1V94VQFY4EPMH","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned and built many PC's. I use them daily. I have been using Macs since the Apple II GS but stopped because of the price and software in the early 2000's. Since OS X and the switch to Intel the Mac is finally back to being a great computer. I really appreciate the Green efforts Apple is making too.Remember the first iBook. That thing was ugly. It was low powered and was a pain to use. Those days are long gone. The New MacBook is Gorgeous and blazing fast. This is a big step up from the last Macbook. For me the multi-touch trackpad alone makes this one of the best computers to use. No other software and hardware comes close to matching the ease of use. I like it so much I wish I could get it with an iMac. Some people won't like the changes but I love them. The improved graphics and overall design is fantastic. The glossy screen pops more than the previous model as long as you can avoid glare and the lack of firewire and the old video ports won't be missed by me.The Apple MacBook Pro MB471LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop (2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB Hard Drive, Slot Loading SuperDrive) is a better machine (I own one and it's my favorite computer so far) and has all the pro features you'd expect as well as a \"Pro\" price tag. If you plan on doing heavy video or Photoshop you need at least 4GB RAM. I don't play games and have not needed to use the better graphics card. Don't worry about graphics card power for Photoshop, a fast Hard Drive and lots of RAM will help more. So far I love the LED backlight glossy screen, which is better then the 13 inch Macbooks. I tend to work in dark environments.I'd love to see the DVD drive go away and have more hard drive space and have 3G/4G mobile internet access. But they will most likely do that with the Macbook Air first, it's already half way there.Some things that I dislike are the monitor, which should be better, I hear it has been recently upgraded. And the lack of firewire is dissapointing but I have it on other machines. Also the back-lit keyboard should be standard. They should give you the Apple Remote too. It is really cool to use with the new Hulu software.One of things that took me some time to get used to was the use of Expose to manage windows, let's you see all your open windows. I got so used to the taskbar in Windows I really wanted every window to live down there. I also was used to the old window shade trick in the older Macs. Now that I'm using the new trackpad I wish windows would learn some new tricks. I also love the feature, Spaces, that let's you have more than one desktop.If you decide to buy a PC use the money you save to buy Windows 7 when it comes out. I'm running it on my 5 year old HP laptop with 512MB RAM and it beats all other Windows OS hands down. So if you are a die hard Windows fan wait for Windows 7. Otherwise get a Mac with OSX 10.5, the best money can buy. Of course you could buy the Mac and install windows on it too.If you don't need a laptop the iMacs make great machines with more hard drive space. I find I'm using more and more Hard Drive space for music, movies and photos as their quality increases. I also have a Time Capsule and love it. I use all my PC's and Macs with it and have had no problems.I also am testing out Apple's MobileMe service. So far my favorite feature is that I can access my external hard drive attached to my Time Capsule anytime I'm on the internet. I also really like the ease of making websites and posting them with password protection. The amazon price for .me is much better then Apple's so I think it will be worth the investment. I'm going to wait since I still have a month left of testing. I also plan to get the new iPhone to test it with it.Please note that Macs are NOT perfect machines. I do tend to have less issues with my Macs and more enjoyment from using them. My poor tricked out PC just doesn't get the time of day anymore. Maybe I need to install OS X on it.[...]","Date":"October 21, 2008"}
{"Title":"I actually have one & don't miss firewire at all","Author":"T. Olivett","ReviewID":"R3QSYUIJYE4UWB","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been buying apple products going back to the IIe through Mac Se, Mac Classic, Duo (remember those), Powerbook 5300, iMac, Mac Mini, Intel iBook etc.  I used a firewire drive on the iMac to add a cd burner and since then I did have to use firewire to use target disk mode for my mini (once in 4 years).SO, MY POINT IS...The reviews about the missing firewire port obviously come from people who are obviously Apple loyalists like myself and are reviewing company policy not the product.I am amazed at my new macbook.  I usually don't buy first gen, but needed a new laptop at the right time (actually thought I'd get a discounted macbook pro after Apple's new product line) and was amazed at the overall elegance of not just the design of the computer but everything from the frontside bus & ram clock speed to the switchable hard drive, standard super drive and in the 3 days I've had it, the joy of the touch pad.Every laptop I've had, I've always hooked up a mouse at home cause I hated the trackpad of all brands (pc's with their double click make me feel like I'm wearing mittens).But the new touchpad is already intuitive, in fact a mouse would feel more uncomfortable. I can set how I want to right click (even if that was all it did I'd cheer) The keyboard's great.  So far it's easily the quietest, coolest (as in temperature) laptop I've ever used.Yeah, it doesn't have a firewire port but since I bought this as a personal computer and don't have any firewire video cameras (hey if you're buying laptops as soon as they're released, you're probably up to date on what cameras you're using).And it has a glossy screen.  I like the way the led (light emitting diode screen) really jumps at you, but i suppose if I take it on a picnic, I'll have to find a shady tree so I can ruin my picnic and work on my computer.Again, if you're not going to use this macbook as an intensive professional systems & networking tool (and if that's what you use computers for get the macbook PRO (as in professional) but feel free to snicker at me.  I'll be too immersed in my macbook to pay attention.If next year Apple or anybody finally creates a laptop that serves all users, is infinitely upgradeable, a 1/4\" thin and 8 ounces & has card slots, an sata port, 3200 firewire, ethernet, direct rca digital cable input, then I'll know I shoulda waited.Oh by the way, the new speakers are actually pretty good, that is to say a 1000 times better than the previous models.","Date":"October 22, 2008"}

{"Title":"Great, expensive laptop.","Author":"J. Christiansen","ReviewID":"RSYEDMSN9ZJI8","Overall":"good","Content":"This laptop is great. I love the keyboard and the overall size. The new trackpad is very cool, but sometimes it doesn't seem to recognize clicks. The new unibody case is a lot stronger than my old MBP. The Firewire is a non-issue for me.There are two faults with this machine.1. The display should be better for this price. Overall it's a decent display, But the blacks arn't black. Apple really skimped on this display. If you use Supercal and calibrate your screen, you can lose the washout effect and it helps a lot. But the blacks are nearly unforgivable. I'm personally going to question any of Apples new products due to this one mistake.2. Overpriced! For what you get, I'm not sure it's worth it. The look is amazing, but performance lags compared to machines hundreds cheaper. Apple products have always carried a premium, but this is getting out of hand. My two year old MBP 2GHz machine is only slightly slower than this one.Overall I guess I'm pretty happy about this laptop. But Apple has lost my trust. They skimped on the display that they talked up during the release. They are going to need to earn my trust back, if they want a penny more from me. I ordered this product assuming I would get a quality product that I was willing to pay a premium for. Instead I get a very nice looking laptop with little substance that I paid a premium for. Apple is suffering from the \"we can't do anything wrong syndrome\". Well the display is lacking and the price is too much for this product. I don't think I could justify spending $1300 on this laptop again. I'll keep it for two years and upgrade again, but Im looking at Apple differently from now on.","Date":"October 26, 2008"}

I told them I bought it from Amazon. They refuse to refund the 150 because they can not \"insert\" the 2GB back to the system.After a long discussion they finally agree ( it took more than an hour and several managers ).So, be aware.

{"Title":"Beautiful but functionally disappointing","Author":"Guido Weppler \"gjw50\"","ReviewID":"R3FRMU1AJ1AG4I","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought my first Apple, a Macbook Pro (13\"). Nice piece of artwork. But I'm shocked by the catastrophic font display and apparent lack of adjustment options (yes, seen the font smoothing option but the result's a joke with or without). I've read many posts on how apple's rendering is different from Windows, how exactly they manage to put so much thought into creating such a poor result, and how people prefer one or the other. But this seems just plain wrong -- I can't believe that there's so many people out there who, out of pure love for original font geometry (or for love of Apple), are willing to sacrifice readability/usability.There's some other disappointing surprises for someone who switches from Windows:- no easy window maximise/minimise, maximisation only via green button that maximises to the layout Apple considers best (I'd often prefer a different window size, mostly full screen, particularly on 13\"). That means you end up using the mouse & moving/changing windows all the time.- very inefficient handling of screen real estate. Lots of permanently displayed info / top menu rows etc that you really don't need most of the time and that cut down usable screen area. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but I don't see an easy way to switch to full screen.- sharp front edge on the unibody... that's very uncomfortable after a short while. Somewhere else I read that for Apple, clearly function follows form. That strikes me as spot on now...- Yes, you can soft-double-tap the large mouse pad, but if you decide to mechanically click it (you can do that anywhere on the pad), the sound of the mechanics is annoyingly loud.Bottom line: I feel mislead by a good amount of (unjustified) enthusiasm of the Apple fans around me. Next time I need to satisfy an esthetic urge, I'll go and buy a new watch instead. Going Apple doesn't seem to be the right reaction if you're unhappy with Microsoft.","Date":"November 13, 2009"}
