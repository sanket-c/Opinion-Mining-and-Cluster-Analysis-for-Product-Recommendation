{"Title":"Long overdue!","Author":"English teacher","ReviewID":"R17IETJS08TAAQ","Overall":"good","Content":"English teachers who work with native speakers of other languages will be thrilled with these flash cards. They are handsomely printed on durable stock with a protective coating for years of shuffling. I've been making my own for over twenty years, but the result has never approached the artful and clear design of these sturdy and compact cards. Students of linguistics should also find these cards useful for developing fluency in IPA transcription.The transcription of the example words for English is a nice compromise between overly broad and unnecessarily narrow. Diacritics, for example, are largely limited to markers of length and syllabicity. A General American accent is the model; primary and secondary stress are marked, as are syllable boundaries. For most ESOL/EFL teachers (at least in the US), the 43 cards covering all the sounds of American English will get the most use, and they are conveniently color-coded (Deck 2) to distinguish them from the rest. Linguistics students will likely spend more time with the other two decks, one with the symbol on one side and its phonetic description on the reverse, and the other giving the names for the individual symbols. The decision to separate into decks and package all three decks together was both generous and wise: for a slightly higher price, you have the capability to accurately describe the languages of any of your students, even if they hail from South Sudan!One might complain that a tool for teaching the sounds of a language should actually make those sounds audibly. (Perhaps the folks at Minokidowinan already have an app for the iPhone in the works!) But really, the task to which these flashcards are best suited is improving the fluency of phonetic transcription, which is, after all, necessarily a written exercise.","Date":"July 19, 2011"}
{"Title":"Very interesting and accessible!","Author":"ghost house","ReviewID":"R1XOQ8ACO588RC","Overall":"good","Content":"While I have a pretty limited knowledge of phonetics/linguistics as a formal discipline, I entered a drawing to win a set of  these cards, because although I have rudimentary knowledge about the IPA, I have always been very interested in it.  These cards make learning and understanding the international phonetic alphabet accessible, and not intimidating.  The three different decks break down each symbol into three components- the phonetic description, transcriptions, and the symbol name.  This breakdown allows you to focus on studying one component without being inundated with too much information, which is helpful if you've just been introduced to the IPA/ phonetics study, and allows you advance your study at your own rate.  The cards are clear and concise, and laid out nicely!  I've really been enjoying using and learning these cards!","Date":"April 2, 2011"}
{"Title":"Pretty Nice Cards","Author":"Eleece","ReviewID":"R1JCHAC2ZCNNS","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm starting my Masters in Teaching English as a Second Language so I wanted something to help me with studying the phonetic alphabet.  These cards are ok, but I wish for the price they would have a little more information.  They give you the mere basics you would expect from flash cards and do not give much more explanation.  That would be fine if I wasn't paying almost 60$ for them. There are many complex terms on the cards that they do not explain at all.  SO not a bad set, but I would have liked them to be a bit more in depth than they are.  Other than that they are made well and have a good organization system.","Date":"May 11, 2013"}
{"Title":"great practical tool, very well-done!","Author":"meghanstrick","ReviewID":"R148VZUJZQNQD6","Overall":"good","Content":"As one with a Bachelor's in Linguistics and much exposure to the world's languages, I have to say these flash cards are excellent.  They are broken down into 3 different flash card types, each one helpful in its own way to mastering the phonetics of the world's languages.  My only disclaimer would be that these cards do require some base-level prerequisite linguistic knowledge.  For example, one set of the cards provides the IPA symbol on one side and the description of the sound on the other.  If you are not familiar with basic phrases used in phonetics like \"central, back, closed, rounded,\" etc... you may have to do some research before using the cards, because there is not an in-depth explanation on the cards.  It is this simplicity and organization of the cards that I actually greatly appreciate.  Lastly, these cards may seem a little pricey... I will say that I think it is worth it.  These cards are made to last and they are a great tool for learning, teaching, using with non-native speakers of a language, using for students learning other languages, etc.  I would recommend these cards to anyone interested in linguistics, learning a new language, or teaching.","Date":"January 15, 2014"}

{"Title":"This book's a lifesaver","Author":"C. Juszak","ReviewID":"R2MCX553KZI0WY","Overall":"good","Content":"While the T3 is a pretty easy camera to use, there are a lot of hidden features and tricks I would probably never have discovered without this book. Chapter 3 starts out with...\"One thing that surprises new owners of the Canon EOS Rebel T3 is that the camera has a total of 496 buttons, dials, switches, levers, latches, and knobs bristling from it's surface. Okay, I lied. Actually, the real number is closer to two dozen controls and adjustments, but that's still a lot of components to master, especially when you consider that many of these controls serve double-duty to give you access to multiple functions.\"This quote serves two purposes here; to illustrate that this is not just a dry reference manual and to point out that there are in fact quite a few bells and whistles that the camera has to offer. I've actually found this book to be an enjoyable read; however I also spend a lot of my time studying military standards which can make just about anything else seem interesting! While it may seem time consuming to read a book geared to just one camera, it's actually a time saver if you really want to know how to get the most out of your T3.","Date":"November 26, 2011"}
{"Title":"Covers everything you must know -- and more.","Author":"Western Photo Reviews","ReviewID":"R1H8TA2T3JEB0G","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the latest of Busch's best-of-breed guidebooks, offering a comprehensive manual for the Canon EOS Rebel T3 entry-level digital SLR. The T3 is a basic 12-megapixel model that lacks some features and the high price tag of more luxe beginner cameras like the T3i, but its affordability will attract beginners who want a camera with room to grow into.  Busch's book has the information you need to learn and grow, supplying easy explanations of using the T3's basic features accompanied by simple introductions to the kind of more advanced capabilities that will help even the rawest neophyte take the best pictures of their lives. Although very accessible, this book goes much deeper than the run-of-the-mill camera guides to offer advice on how to use every control, select every menu option.. The author's friendly style leads you through the camera's features and tells you not only what each capability does, but gives examples of when you'll get the most benefit from using it. Busch explains all the new features for the D5100 in a way that's easy to understand. His novel approach is to condense all the essential information about each and every control on the camera into a multi-page \"roadmap\" that explains their functions without the need to leap around from page to page, as is the case with the Canon manual. He devotes several full chapters to outlining every menu option, and actually provides much more detail than you'll find in most of the other \"expanded\" guides for the T3.Although this book is comprehensive, it's easy reading, and if you want a condensed version to carry around with you, Busch offers that too. His David Busch's Compact Field Guide for the Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D is a worthy replacement for those laminated cheat sheets that fold out into six index card sized tabs with one-sentence summaries of most of the menu settings, too. While the portable version duplicates some of the information found in this book, the two make a great pair for home and field. You'll want to buy them both to have the information you need on the go and for study at home.","Date":"July 28, 2011"}

{"Title":"Absolutely informative and helpful","Author":"Amanda","ReviewID":"R2OI53BGIMPVPQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I had never used or even purchased a dSLR before and was debating on buying the T3/1100D. I was looking at various guides and this one really stood out. I breezed through others but it was David Busch's guide I bought. I actually bought his guide to field work which is rally helpful too.This book was the deciding factor on whether I wanted the t3 or not. I did all of my research read through all of the reviews on the T3 however I did not know how comfortable I would feel with this camera. I could play with it all day at the store but if I couldn't understand from the guide and from my own level compentency it just wouldn't be the purchase for me.David Busch really did a great job. This book is for everyone no matter how skilled you are with the dSLR already. I felt immediately comfortable and truly felt like I was understanding and grasping his directions. He did not assume anything on the readers part nor did he speak down to the reader.I have since added several other books of his to my wish list. I have this one on my kindle but I think I will be buying it in paperback as well just to have a backup incase I want to flip or highlight anything on actual paper. I have since followed him on his blog and become a very big fan of his writing. I may not know everything heck or even 1% about photography but I do feel that it is something I can learn and am not thinking it is an impossible task anymore thanks to Busch's books","Date":"December 31, 2011"}
{"Title":"Perfect companion.","Author":"Image Print Reviews","ReviewID":"RLPWH1O9Q2M1U","Overall":"good","Content":"Although this book is similar in layout and much content to the author's T3i guide, owners of the entry-level T3 model need this version, because the features of the two cameras don't completely overlap.  This one is written specifically for the T3, and is easily the best available guide for this camera. A quick glance through this innovative book shows that Busch is the world's best-selling camera guide author for a reason. His books are a cut above the other books, which all repeat what you see in the book packaged with the camera, without going into any depth on how to use them. This one, although compact and portable,  is different, with Busch's trademark friendly introduction to the Canon EOS Rebel T3, accessible to anyone -- novice to veteran -- who wants to learn how to use the camera quickly. In that respect, it's great for beginners. But the author is especially skilled at taking you beyond the basics to explain exactly how to apply the features of the T3 to improve your photographic skills.Individual chapters of the book explore the finer points of exposure, including the use of histograms, understanding the T3's autofocus options, HD movie-making, and creative ways to use lenses and light. There are thirteen chapters in all, each of them dealing with a different aspect of using the EOS T3. Even the general material on topics like f/stops and exposure all relate directly to his camera.This book is especially good for those who feel they are \"visually oriented.\" These folks tend to gravitate to DVD instruction, not realizing that such productions are basically audio programs with images, and aren't really visually oriented at all. With a DVD, you're basically using your ears to listen to a talking head explain the camera, and what you hear may not sink in immediately. Busch's guide takes the right visual approach, using large full-color illustrations accompanied by the text you need to quickly understand what the author is explaining. We've reviewed several of Busch's guides, and, after reading this one, still wonder why all camera guides aren't this good.","Date":"July 28, 2011"}
{"Title":"\"Sit down with me and let me show you how...\"","Author":"sford122","ReviewID":"R1UAXXVFTSDKVA","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased my Rebel T3 about a month ago and am in love with this camera.  It is my first dSLR and I have a lot to learn as a newbie.  I've identified a wonderful photography forum at Ugly Hedgehog.com and enjoy seeing photos and reading how photographers caught their shots.  Many links are provided to hundreds of websites for further information.  This has been fun but overwhelming in trying to learn the ins and outs of dSLR and specifically my T3, just because of the massive amount of information that is available and so much of it that is not applicable to my T3.  However, what I gained most was one user stating that \"anyone who owns a Rebel T3 needs to get David Busch's Canon EOS Rebel T3/1100D Guide to Digital SLR Photography\".  My search led me to Amazon and after reading the first chapter free, I was hooked.  I purchased the Kindle version so I have it to take with me as needed.  It is easy to read and the picture quality is good, even though it is in black and white only.  Having it on my computer Kindle library is like getting 2 books for the price of one.  The large computer colored screen view with fantastic quality pictures is a real plus.  As to the quality of the information the author provides, I find it exceptionally easy to understand.  He really does make me feel like he is sitting down with me and showing me how to use my new camera and all of its features.  I just made my purchase today and am so pleased with it.  This is one book that I know I will read cover to cover and will have as a much used reference book in the future.

{"Title":"Somewhat disappointed","Author":"Elfin Reviews","ReviewID":"RYDCA91IVFTIL","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently purchased a Canon T3 - an upgrade to my original Digital Rebel.Bought this title based on the 5-star reviews here.I was a bit skeptical when I read in the first paragraph of Powering Up/Setting Date and Time:Rotate the On/Off switch on top of the camera to the On position. \"Automatic sensor cleaning takes place (unless you specifically disable this action) as the T3 powers up.\"As the Canon salesman pointed out to me - the T3 does NOT have any automatic sensor cleaning!Back in Chapter 13 he posts the correct info:\"The EOS T3 lacks one of the most common features found in all Canon cameras other than a stray entry-level model or two like this one: automatic sensor cleaning.\"I'm thinking this was a copy/paste of the T3i or T2i with editing done.  I wonder what else I will find amiss.He also fails to mention that to get to a lot of the camera settings via the menu, the mode must be set to M.But, all in all, I suppose I will actually learn how to use my DSLR on other than the creative or auto modes.","Date":"January 12, 2012"}

{"Title":"A \"Must Read\" for this camera","Author":"JesseJ","ReviewID":"ROGLLTHRDY2TD","Overall":"good","Content":"I recently purchased the Nikon D5100 and read the owners manual as diligently as I could, trying to figure out how to fully use all of the possible options this camera has to offer.  It becomes quite apparent that the Owners Manual simply isn't enough.I ordered this book and it arrived a couple of weeks ago, and it really opened my eyes as to what this camera is capable of.  Everything is set out in sensible chapters, shows and explains every mode available, and gives you a sense of empowerment over the camera, instead of bewilderment.If you are upgrading from a basic DSLR or taking a huge jump to this camera as a first DSLR, then this book is a must.  Without it, or something like it, then realizing the full potential of this camera could take a very long time, and be very frustrating.With my camera body I bought a very good lens.  I'm delighted I also bought this very good book.","Date":"September 18, 2011"}
{"Title":"Most complete and easily-understood D5100 Guidebook","Author":"Western Photo Reviews","ReviewID":"R1S3YJBOS1UGM3","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the latest Busch's industry-best guidebooks, offering a comprehensive manual for the Nikon D5100 mid-level digital SLR. This one is a companion for Nikon's ground-breaking upgrade from the entry-level D3100.  The D5100 features a swiveling LCD, full HDTV movie making, 16.2 megapixel resolution, and other features not usually found in a low-cost D-SLR.  Busch gives them all a workout in this book, going much deeper than the run-of-the-mill camera guide to offer advice on how to use every control, select every menu option, and take the best pictures of your life.  The author's friendly style leads you through the camera's features and tells you not only what each capability does, but gives examples of when you'll get the most benefit from using it.  Busch explains all the new features for the D5100 in a way that's easy to understand. His novel approach is to condense all the essential information about each and every control on the camera into a multi-page \"roadmap\" that explains their functions without the need to leap around from page to page, as is the case with the Nikon manual. He devotes several full chapters to outlining every menu option, and actually provides much more detail than you'll find in most of the other \"expanded\" guides for the D5100.Although this book is a weighty tome, it's easy reading, and if you want a condensed version to carry around with you, Busch offers that too.  His David Busch's Compact Field Guide for the Nikon D5100 is a worthy replacement for those laminated cheat sheets that fold out into six index card sized tabs with one-sentence summaries of most of the menu settings, too. While the portable version duplicates some of the information found in this book, the two make a great pair for home and field. You'll want to buy them both to have the information you need on the go and for study at home.","Date":"July 28, 2011"}
{"Title":"Worth the Investment","Author":"Derek Fray","ReviewID":"R1UY5QHW1GR4B7","Overall":"good","Content":"David Busche hits a home run with this book.  The information is written in such a way that even the most beginning camera buff can understand the concepts and the step-by-step approach makes learning how to use a very complex camera simple.  The color photos are clear, the instructions and menu descriptions are accurate and easy to follow.  I was looking for an informative manual since the user's manual that comes with the camera explains what everything is and or does, but it falls short on telling the user \"WHY\" to use certain settings or features for certain results.  David Busche is a fantastic teacher and no-nonsense expert in photography and the use of Nikon Cameras.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.. If you have recently purchased the Nikon D5100 or any Nikon product, this book is a MUST HAVE companion and an absolute bargain for the price.","Date":"April 16, 2012"}
{"Title":"Manual with larger and colour photos","Author":"Peter Theobald","ReviewID":"R396YQ9TJDAK2N","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this book based on the author's reputation and on other positive reviews but am sorry to report that I was disappointed. I went through it once, it is only a glorified manual, with larger photos in colour instead of small line drawings the manual has.  It tells you what each control or button does, but how exactly to use it, when to use it and why to use it -- is often not covered. At times it tells you what it does (exactly as the manual does) without further elucidation, which is why people buy the book in the first place.I think it might be a cut-and-paste from some earlier book the author has written about another Nikon camera, because on one page (Page 134) it refers to a \"focus selector lock lever\" which is non-existent on this camera model (d5100). Not expected from an author with one million books in printOn the positive side, it contains some useful info about lenses, accessories, software, but not worth the price of the book.I am unlikely to open it up again. I also bought \"From Snapshots to Great Shots on the D5100 - I think that is a better buy","Date":"June 14, 2012"}

After skimming through the parts of the book that covered the kind of close-up studio photography of miniatures that I hoped to do, I was convinced I should buy the camera. After I had bought the camera, the book was indispensible for using the camera effectively, being much more comprehensive than the Owner's Manual that came with the camera. When I had questions about how to improve my photography, the book's well organized Table of Contents and Index led me to great solutions. If you are thinking about buying the Nikon D5100, I think this book is essential.","Date":"June 22, 2012"}

But this book is excellent and very helpful. It's very comprehensive and explains every little function of the camera. You learn to realize that you can set the camera maybe 3 different ways and still come up with the same outcome... and that's comforting as a photographer when you have to think-quick and your subjects are moving all over the place. (it's good to know you have options to get a good photo!).Excellent book.

{"Title":"Great Guide for the D5100","Author":"James Hood","ReviewID":"R1JULY729G5VH2","Overall":"good","Content":"What I loved about this book was that Busch presents everything you need to know about the Nikon D5100 is easy to digest chunks.  He starts with several quick start chapters that help you hit the ground running, saving the in depth information for later chapters when you really need it.  For example, he first shows you how to set the various autofocus options so you'll get sharp focus just about every time.  After you've shot a bunch, you'll be ready for the clear explanations of exactly how autofocus works in Chapter 5, so you can vary your settings according to Busch's recommendations to give you sharp focus in problematic situations.  There are separate chapters on shooting movies, working with electronic flash (both built in and external flash), and descriptions of all your lens options.  The Nikon D5100 is an intermediate camera, suitable for both beginners and more enthusiastic photographers and Busch does an excellent job of helping both groups discover the possibilities of their camera.  Recommended.","Date":"August 17, 2011"}

{"Title":"A good combination of tech information and personal recommendation","Author":"JackOfMostTrades \"Jack\"","ReviewID":"R1N5B9JWBR2S6N","Overall":"good","Content":"For a general all-around guide to the D5100, I don't think you'll find a better book. However, be forewarned that the first section of the book explores Nikon technology that allows for this camera's ability to grab images in low light, capture color, use 3D Matrix focusing, more accurately record the light spectrum. This is interesting stuff, but it won't necessarily teach you how to use the camera optimally.  The rest contains great advice and is clearly written, and he author is able to complement the technical information with recommendations based on personal experience.  The Nikon D 5100 has a number of bells and whistles that I don't think most photographers will hvae much use for In the latter case, i.e.,the author spends a lot of time describing features you may not ever use. The only other non-Nikon consumer guidebook I've had was a \"PIP\" publication, and if the comparison between this manual and the \"PIP\" manual can be generalizable to both series, I'd say there's no contest. This one is far, far better.","Date":"April 27, 2012"}

I started at the beginning of the book and then chased the instructions from chapter to chapter and page to page having to look up where the different buttons are on the camera. You only get a little snippet of the instructions in each area of the book. I never found out how to perform this after looking for at least 15 minutes. Instead of having it all in one location with easy to read instructions. I then challenged my wife to try and figure it out using the book. She is still trying to follow this with no results. If this is this guys idea of easy instructions for a beginner then don't bother with any of his other books either. I also purchased the Field Guide and  tried using the pictures in it to help.  I also tried the instructions in the Field Guide and they were also not complete. Following this book I could not get most of his instructions to work at all. If I could return this book I would but now I am stuck with both of them. I was hoping for a book that is easy to read and has all the instruction for a function in one location, with maybe a picture of where the button are you need to use for that particular function. This book is only good for a person that knows all the terms and is very familiar with this camera. My wife is still trying and she finally gave up on the book and is just poking around and having much better luck. So far the things that do work are nothing like the book says. If you do  figure out how to use a function I suggest you write it down because it will take you another hour to figure it out again. I think this camera is pretty confusing to start with and having some one that is a camera nut can not write instructions that are easy to read.Save your money and look some where else for help.","Date":"September 16, 2012"}

I looked at David Busch's larger guide to this camera and felt it was overkill for my needs. That being said, this book is just right. I bought the camera as a supplement to my D200 because I was intrigued with it's versatile, movable LCD screen.  I wanted to find out quickly how to use all the whizz bang features. This book does all I wanted and more.Because the D5100 is an entry level camera it contains some information that is much more fundamental than I need. The book is still a great resource.

It has the numbers totally inaccurate and that could cause some serious problems. They claim it is up to date, but it is not! The thing that annoys me about the folks who publish this map and field guides is they get it vetted by some knuckle head who poses as an authority but is clueless. It never occurs to them to try to use their product or watch their target market use them. So, the product is mediocre and they could care less. At one time National Geographic stood for some level of integrity but that seems to be a thing of the past.","Date":"December 29, 2013"}

We brought this map on a week-long kayak trip. The detail is insufficient to navigate the everglades. Entire islands are missing from the map, some of which are substantial in size (10s of acres) and other island are misshapen. If your compass skills are  solid you can get by usually if sticking to the outer islands, but one should certainly buy the nautical chart for Everglades. No where on the map does it say \"not intended for navigational use.\" It should say this in big red letters on the front. This is the first time a trails illustrated map has failed us.","Date":"March 30, 2014"}

It is not a bad effort, but could be better, especially in helping decide settings for different photo situations. As it is, this card is more like a color-coded index of the different items in the menus.  Useful, yes.  But nothing that will help you master the camera settings.

These cards are light and portable, so they don't contribute more bulk and weight to your camera bag. I used them with my D70s and will continue to do so with any new SLR I acquire.

I am neither and I find it comes in handy quite often, ISince it is plastic laminated I can carry in my camera bag and get it out in any kind of weather. I already had the D-80 camera and \"cheat sheet\" thus when I got my D-90 I just naturally purchased the same sheet.There are actually 12 sections that covers very briefly the operation of the D-90. This includes a Custom Setting section, Flash photography,white balance,exposure,metering, bracketing,Control panel and Playback. Even if you only seldom use this guide you will find the cost to be minimal for the information listed. By the way, all of the info on the card is also contained in your user manual, however why carry that manual with you everywhere you go? This is well worth the small price paid.","Date":"July 30, 2012"}

It contanse a wealth of diagrams and pictures I have never seen in other publications so it is not a warmed over introduction to the camera, the family and the long history of this lens manufacturing company. I highly recommend this book as the most definitive gathering of information I have ever seen on one camera. It contains information on each model of Leica, including cross setions, but its real strength is the discussion of optics and the design and manufacturing of the lens. It has a comprehensive section with MTF diagrams of all the Leica lens up to the most recent including the 50mm/.95 Noctilux lens.I have had this book for six months now and cannot get out of it as there is so much information. There are a few errors in the labeling of diagrams and mixed up pictures but they do not distract from the enormity of infromation provided. If I had one book on this company and its cameras and lens this would be it.

{"Title":"Very versatile.  Good photos.  Great macro!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2H7QG1SKTYDFI","Overall":"good","Content":"This thing is hard on batteries.  Use High capacity (1100mah or higher) nicads or Nimh.  Carry extra sets. But...pictures are excellent.  It has three distance settings close up, portrait, and distance.  The macro close  up is wonderful.  As close a six inches!  And the exposure is perfect. You  have to get used to distances, especially with flash, when changing the  distance feature.I would swear this is an Agfa.  Looks EXACTLY like it.  Same price.  For the price, it is a great deal.You can \"frame\"  your picture with the viewfinder, or the LCD display in back.  You can  display pictures on the TV (video in, not RF in), and load into a computer  using any RS232 COMM port. The Camera's software is ok.  The  \"TWAIN\" driver (connection between camera and photo software)  attaches to all photo software in the computer, not just the Photomax  program that comes with it. Just select the source in your program.It  resembles a 35mm \"Point and Shoot\" camera in many respects.  It  has a nice cover that slips over the lens and turns the camera on and off.  If you can use a P&S, you can use this.Resolution using the  12exposure mode (high resolution, just 12 pictures) is just about as good  as 100ISO or 200ISO camera print film. Looks tolerable on a 32\"  TV!I have many GOOD 35mm SLR's, and am happy with this little jewel.  No  more stacks of negatives stored away.  Just a few recordable CD's, and I  can put the images on a floppy to give to family, or email the pictures.  It' won't, of course, replace the SLR's, but for many uses it's great.","Date":"December 4, 1999"}

These were the steps I took to begin taking great pictures:  (1) Take the stuff out of the box. (2) Put the batteries in the camera and  set the date. (3) Install the PhotoMAX software in the PC. (4) Take  pictures. (5) Load pictures into PC using software and save images as .jpg  files. (6) Send friends and family pictures through e-mail.  It's that  simple!The only downside I see with this product is the annoying green  indicator light in the viewfinder.  And this camera doesn't really do well  with close-up shots.  You have to be at least three feet away.  Also only  use the video screen when you are using the AC adapter.  If you don't, then  your batteries will drain fast.Bottomline is I am happy with this  product and I got my money's worth.","Date":"May 18, 2000"}

After taking it out of the package, within an hour, I had pictures on my auction pages. I use the 24 images - just what I need for auctions.  I took some great  scenic shots last weekend and viewed them through my television like a  slideshow. The pictures were bright and beautiful. Close-ups are a little  blurry. Pics are fine with the other settings. Batteries go dead real fast  if you use without the adaptor, so don't use the lcd screen while you are  taking pictures.  I took about 50 pictures over the weekend with the same  batteries.Other people who have seen my camera, can't believe I paid  less than $200. They have ones they paid over $400 for, that aren't any  different than this one. In fact, they said they liked mine better and  offered to trade. So far, so good.

Wifey and I had been kicking around the idea of getting a digital camera for a while, but  the pile of \"toys we don't play with anymore\" was too large to  warrant buying something expensive on a lark.  We shopped around and found  the Polaroid didn't have all the bells and whistles that we'd read about in  all the gizmo magazines, but it didn't carry that price either.  I don't  think that two days has gone by without us using it in some way. If you run  on line auctions or post pictures to a web site this little guy will do  everything you need.  Need something to e-mail pictures to grandma?  You  can even hook it up to a TV with the included cables and run a slideshow  for the family.  The software it comes with is fairly easy to use and setup  was a breeze.  The serial connection is quite a bit slower than USB, but  for the price there are really no complaints. Like I said before, if you  want to try out digital photography and see of it's a fit for you pick up  this camera.  Try it for a year until the mega pixel guys come down in  price.  You won't be disappointed.","Date":"July 19, 2000"}

This camera drains batteries so quickly it is a joke.  In less than 30 minutes you can drain 4 AA batteries, so you must buy at least two sets of Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, however those take 5 hours to charge.  The picture quality is  not so good, it produces grainy pictures. But don't get me wrong, it does  serve it's purpose, on email/www the pictures look fine.  The LCD screen  has a slow refresh rate but is very usable.  In darker places, the  viewfinder is blocked by a green \"ready\" light.  But outside or  in a highly lit room it's great.

{"Title":"Are we taling about the same camera?","Author":"\"denisey65\"","ReviewID":"R19PDZNRVKWZRA","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this as a first time digital camera purchase- about two years ago.  I am very pleased with both the quality of this camera and the ease of use- especially for the price.  The few negative reviews I read posted  here have me a little confused, though- there are various selections for  the settings on this camera, which could explain some problems.  I have  lots of really nice shots using this camera.  None would work to enlarge to  poster size, though- so don't buy it for making really big prints.  I like  the way my 5x7 prints and smaller turn out for my scrapbooking and crafts  needs.Of course, another consideration would be the printers the  negative reviewers used in printing their images, ... they don't mention  the paper type, either- all very important in the quality of the end  product.As for the \"grainy\" images- the flash is a little less  than perfect for indoor shots sometimes- but not always.  Lighting is  important in any photography, and my favorite shots were nearly all taken  outdoors, with natural light.  You definitely cannot rush the recharge on  the flash- you'll get dark images every time.  Also- the \"video\"  function on the LCD monitor is a huge battery drain.  Skip using it.  I  bought an optional FlashPath adapter that allows me to use the SmartMedia  memory card in my floppy drive- excellent way to go- instead of using  cables and power suppplies directly to the camera.I really don't see it  as a battery hog, unless you use the \"video\" option- which isn't  needed to take pictures at all.I will look for a date stamp in my next  digital camera, as well as an on/off switch NOT connected to a sliding lens  cover.  Still- great shots at reasonable print size, for a bargain price---  a good deal, in my opinion (a Mom of 4 who takes a LOT of kid pictures!)","Date":"April 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"One Great Affordable Camera","Author":"\"lklady\"","ReviewID":"R1J31JDN5XCW2L","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera in February of 2000, and I have already taken hundreds of pictures! I think it takes decent pictures and is an excellent camera for beginners.  I have some advice for anyone looking at getting  this camera, #1, buy rechargeable batteries and a charger. I spent about  $20 on a charger that came with 4 batteries and an additional pack of 4  batteries, and I haven't had any trouble since. #2, if possible, buy a  larger memory card. The 2 meg will get you fine, but the 8 would be really  nice for me right now! #3, get the adapter for the memory. This way you  won't have to fiddle with the cables and ac adaptor, my serial cable went  out already and had to be replaced.. Heavy use! The reason I give this a  4 and not a 5 star rating is because of the resolution. While it does take  nice pictures, the print output is really only the best on the highest  resolution, and the prints are small (4x6). I would say this camera is best  for taking small pictures or for web/email use. Overall I think you will  enjoy the freedom of a digital camera, and this one is an affordable option  for many people.","Date":"May 23, 2000"}

( no i didnt get help  from my parents writing this review ) I used to have a POS camera called a  JamC@m. Believe me, never buy it.  Anyway, this camera quite good, but i  thought a little to much i guess, cause the pictures were only 640 by 480  pixels. This was quite the disapointment. I still have fun making slide  show like movies with the TV port.  Oh,  and, if you have a mac, dont buy  this product.  If you are a profetianoa photographer, but dont have tons of  money, buy this camera.

{"Title":"Not the best DC but, for the money, I like it","Author":"Stephen","ReviewID":"R2XO7PCW6PC5HB","Overall":"good","Content":"The camera itself is great for the money you pay.  No it's not as good as the $900 super-loaded 1.2 mega pixel giants but it is a very nice purchase.  Yes, the little colored monitor follows the action with a huge blurry delay but most cameras this cheap don't even come with one so, you get what you pay for I say.  That in mind, you aren't recording video here  so why would the display need to follow the movement like a camcorder as  long as, when you stop moving, it focuses clearly?  I'm no photographer so  I say this from a novice point of view, the camera does not take pictures  well in low light situations.  Its best performance comes from good ambient  lighting such as outside or in a brightly lit room.  I'd also like to see  it come with more then 2 megs of memory but that would up the price so I  wont complain too much.  Those little static RAM cards are way too  expensive.  All-in-all the camera did as advertised and did it well enough  for my taste but keep in mind I'm no photographer.  I really hate, though,  the stupidly place green LED in the viewfinder!  It all but forces you to  waste battery life and use the LCD to find the right picture angle.  I  think they could have found a better place for that dumb little light that  seems to have no purpose other then to be an annoyance.I say the camera  was good but the included software was a nightmare to get working.  It took  me 2 days of tinkering before I got the camera to upload images to the PC.  I'm still not sure if my software disk wasn't messed up, like it could have  just had a bad installer.  I finally tried a custom install to make sure  everything was getting installed properly and that worked.  But before that  I contacted the tech support at Polaroid and they were absolutely no help,  telling me to try things I had already tried and I even stated that I tried  them in my original e-mail.  I still don't think they even read my whole  message.  They just saw \"my camera wont upload images right\" and assumed  idiot.  When I finally did get the software working it did everything it  was suppose to.  Though I haven't tried everything it offers yet.  When the  pictures came through to the PC they looked nice and crisp.So, all  things considered, you might want to shop around for a better low price  camera but this one is fine once you get everything to sync right.  If  you're not a pro I'd say keep this one in mind because it does just as  advertised quite well and thus far Polaroid is the only company offering  low priced digital cameras with LCD color monitors, which I like a lot.","Date":"March 2, 2000"}

One happens to be the choice of resolution or detail that the picture will capture. This allows you to have from 12  extremely detailed pictures to 48 great looking pictures that are not as  detailed. Overall this camera is great and I would recommend this product  to anyone interested in purchasing one. One drawback, the serial cable used  to download pictures to your computer will obviously not fit the new USB  ports so watch out.","Date":"January 14, 2000"}

With a handy charger and spare batteries, I can snap  pics anytime, day or night without the fuss of getting film developed AND I  can retouch practically anything unwanted in any picture. It has just the  right options for any kind of photo I want such as: resolution, lens, and  flash settings. Close-ups of this Spring's flowers and my newborn kittens  were outstanding as well as distant shots of landscapes.  I even set-up a  backdrop and made professional looking photos of my friends!  The software  is easy to install, user friendly, and loaded with options.  I've certainly  learned many tips and tricks for making super photos simply by using the  Polaroid PDC 640 and a little practice!","Date":"September 14, 2000"}

It's affordable, easy to use, and incredibly durable and convenient!  My first PDC640 bought 2 yrs ago has paid for itself several times during vacations, holidays, household and business inventory, school events, and hobbies.  The focal range is equivalent to 35mm camera using 100 speed film.  Different categories of photos can be stored in your own labeled albums.  Friends and family enjoyed my camera so much I bought more as gifts along with $15 rechargers and batteries.  The LCD viewfinder screen is useful for closeup shots of small items like coins, jewelry, and old family photos. The 2MB memory card holds up to 96 shots making animated picture videos a fun option not to mention the PhotoMAX software's web page publishing and electronic postcard features. Free utilities found on the internet such as jpeg optimizers can reduce size making photos easier to store without hogging space, too.

{"Title":"Literal Garbage","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1PFXXBT8K1GZU","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this camera approximately 2 months ago.  After much use, I found this product to be literal garbage; as if someone had literally packaged a piece of garbage and sent it to me.  The refresh rate on the LCD is  horrible, not even worth using.  Sometimes to get the LCD screen to work it  is necessary to bang on the side of the camera.  The viewfinder is blocked  by an annoying green light and is off by a few millimeters.  The supplied  AA's last only about 15 to 20 mins.  If you are unfortunate enough to buy  this camera, get rechargeables.  The picture quality is horrid at best,  pictures turning out grainy and pixelated.  Overall, buying a disposable  35mm is a better choice.","Date":"March 17, 2000"}

I heard many bad things about this camera while I was looking to buy. Everything from bad pictures to the annoying blinking green light in the view finder. But let me tell you that after buying this camera I have found nothing bad about it. It's very easy to use and to setup on your computer. I love the ease in using the small SmartMedia storage card that holds your pictures in the camera. It comes with a 2meg card but you may want to buy another with it for more storage while on vacation or for when you dont have time to get all the pictures off one card. I bought the 8meg card at the same time as the camera and found that I had way more space then I needed but was happy knowing that I would not run out. (8meg card holds up to around 300 pics!) Where I work they have a digital camera that cost them about $..., it has a few more features that are nice but not really needed and I feel that the 640 takes as good of pictures.

{"Title":"Very Good For Beginners But Needs More Resolution","Author":"Sam Bethune","ReviewID":"R5FTSWH3DGG6F","Overall":"good","Content":"I won a Polaroid PDC 640 Creative Kit in a contest.  Given its current MSRP, I would not have purchased it due to the limited resolution (640 x 480 pixels).  The market is full of digital cameras with better resolution (1-1.5 megapixels) for about the same price.  As ease of use goes, it doesn't get much better than this.  You simply put in the batteries, install the SmartMedia card, turn it on, and start clicking away.  In order to download the pictures you've taken the software must be installed to your computer.  In response to the one reviewer who complained about the software not being compatible with certain editions of Windows, you need merely to go to Polaroids's website and download the patch for Windows 2000 or in my case, Windows XP.  It took only a few minutes to download and I was soon up and running.  This camera is fairly intuitive if you have at least a working knowledge of digital cameras.  I found myself only having to review the user's manual once, and it is fairly straightforward. The green flash indicator in the viewfinder makes it difficult to frame your shot as one previous reviewer noted, and aside from the limited resolution this is about the only other negative thing I can say about the camera.  Although it interfaces with the computer via serial cable as opposed to the much faster USB, I haven't found this to be a major problem.  I downloaded 14 pictures to my PC in only about 2-3 minutes just the night before writing this review.  Picture quality is fair in the high resolution mode, good in super high resolution mode.  I don't recommend using either the medium or low resolution settings.Lastly, regarding battery life complaints I haven't found the PDC 640 to be any worse than any other digital camera.  The kit includes an AC adapter which I highly recommend be used for downloads, which accounts for considerably more battery drain than actual picture taking.  The resolution mode you use will also make a difference (higher resolution = more battery use).If you're looking for an easy to use digital camera the PDC 640 is a very good choice.  If you want the highest quality that digital photography has to offer, look elsewhere...but you'll have a slightly more complicated camera.","Date":"June 8, 2002"}
{"Title":"Not too shabby","Author":"mngeniuk","ReviewID":"R225BGAH7AVL6T","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great product for the price.  Yes, the batteries drain a little fast if you use the LCD screen too much.  The resolution isn't professional quality, but it works for the average user.  If you get an 8 MB SmartMedia card, you can take tons of pictures.  Good lighting is a must - a lot of my indoor pictures haven't turned out too good because of dim lighting.  I guess the flash is a little weak.  Also, we've had a problem with the LCD screen - it stopped working after only a couple months.  We had fresh batteries and all, the screen just quit on us.  My mother in law had the same problem, but Polaroid replaced the camera for her (she just had to pay for shipping it).  We're working on that right now.  Recommend a Flash Path 3.5 floppy adapter - it works great for transfering files without messing with cables or anything.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

{"Title":"A Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3TLD7WA66TE11","Overall":"bad","Content":"Regardless of any other braindead reviews, here's the only one you need to read:  I purchased this camera approximately 6 months ago, and I must say I am not mollified with the product.  The bad stuff:  The green LED indicator  light gets in the way of aiming your shots, forcing you to use the blurry,  battery-draining LCD screen which is among the worst I have EVER seen on a  digital camera.  The battery power is terrible at best; rechargeables are  the only way to go.  Being a digital camera salesman, I can say without  doubt...this camera is not worth its price tag.  While other reviews may  state that the camera is easy to use, it is merely due to the fact that the  camera has almost no features: no manual control of shots, no zoom, and is  only able to support up to a 8mb memory card(45 pictures max.)  The picture  quality will suffice for monitor viewing only.  Printing out the pictures  leaves something to be desired; using photo quality paper on my brand new  Lexmark printer gave me mixed results.  While printing out smaller image  sizes(3x5) resulted in fair quality pictures, attempting to print larger  size images produced very grainy pictures.  Also, the flash on the camera  is not powerful enough for many low-light situations.  There are much  better cameras on the market in the $200-300 price range.  Please don't  disappoint me buy purchasing this camera.","Date":"May 9, 2000"}

{"Title":"Not bad for a second camera, but...","Author":"Eric McCann","ReviewID":"R3DULHCTEQD5E7","Overall":"good","Content":"This was the second digital camera I picked up, to replace an early one that was fine for the time, but...The PDC640 takes decent pictures \"for the web,\" as others have said. If that, and simple needs, are all you want, great. Do yourself a favor, though, and pick up a USB media card reader. The software and serial cable are not supported under WinXP, or on a Mac - but the images are stored on the card as .jpg files, readable anywhere. The USB reader will be *many* times faster than the serial cable, as well, and no special software is needed.If you print the pictures (full page) you'll notice some problems - but if you're to the point of printing pictures, you'll want a higher resoution camera anyway. It also takes a LONG time to charge, and several seconds between shots to recharge. Battery life really depends on what batteries you buy - cheap ones, it'll eat like a kid with candy. Buy decent batteries (or rechargables) and they'll last a long, long time. When the batteries are ready to go, though (1/4 left in the indicator) the pictures get awfully dark - you can see them get darker and darker. The viewscreen will, of course, eat them faster.If you need high resolution, zoom, etc. this isn't the camera for you. For quick family pics, though, it's fine.","Date":"October 19, 2003"}

Now I have a white iBook and there's basically no hope for compatibility, as my camera only came with a serial cable (not a USB cable).  Polaroid's recent Chapter 11 filing probably means I won't get Mac OS X drivers any time soon (though Apple may come through in the next versions of iPhoto).

However it's over a year later and the price has hardly dropped!  The digital camera world is moving at a very fast pace, I'm sure there's something more up to date in this price range.  Also the reason I was visiting this board in the first place is that I damaged the software CD and cannot install the software for the camera in my new computer.  Polaroid does NOT offer the software drivers for download!  Unacceptable for a product of this type.  They want 39.99 for their software package, all of which is useless(I use PS or Thumbs + for image manipulation) except for the twain driver.  Any other digital cam offers the drivers for download on their site. A few more notes.  1.  Another use you may have overlooked for the camera is as a webcam.  Using a video capture card and the \"TV\" cable for the camera and video mode on the camera you can use this camera (or any camera with a video out) as a webcam. The image more than suitable for internet broadcasting.  It will get hot, but I have run my camera for weeks on end as an \"always on\" cam and have suffered no related problems.2.  On my camera, In addition to the green light in the viewfinder, the image guide in the viewfinder is misalligned so you must use the display screen.  If I wasn't so lazy I probably should have traded this camera in for a properly alligned one.","Date":"October 25, 2000"}

{"Title":"Excellent image quality, ease of use","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R63V4FRV3YUP9","Overall":"good","Content":"I am an architect and have been using the camera for taking construction progress photos since it first came out.  I have found that the battery  life is best when I use NiMH rechargable batteries. I carry an extra set at  all times.  Using the highest quality image setting and a 30 MB flashcard,  I can get about 45 shots.  I use flash quite a bit for interior shots, and  this of course reduces battery life just a bit.  I don't quite trust the  wimpy little wrist strap, so usually I use a camera bag or my pocket (One  of the reasons I bought it was the compact size, compared to other digitals  in the price range). I also purchased several auxiliary lenses - a super  wide angle and a couple of close-up lenses - from Kodak, and find them  quite useful.  For my work, being able to date stamp is essential, although  I suppose all digitals probably allow date/time stamping.  My major  criticism is the lack of recovery time after taking a shot.  The longer the  batteries have been in use, the longer the wait.","Date":"November 1, 1999"}

The pictures are every bit as good as a good point and  shoot...without the film expense!I print a lot of 4x6 prints from the  camera on my HP Photosmart printer and you cannot tell them from a good  35mm print. Well actually you can....the prints from my DC260 and printer  are better!I bought Ni-MH batteries and charger and they are a MUST. I  don't have problems with the batteries draining too fast with the N-MH.  Another must have is a USB ScanDisk compact flash card reader. It's  lighting fast and saves camera batteries since you just pop the card from  the camera and then download to your PC. You need the fast download you get  from the USB because you will take a LOT more pictures with a digital  camera. There is one last MUST have and that's MSPicture-it2000. I have  just about all the photo programs...but the only one I loaded on my new  computer was Picture-it.The only negative to the camera is that it takes  a little long to process mulitple pictures...this camera is not for quick  action shots!I have been VERY happy with my digital camera and my  \"digital darkroom\" setup.","Date":"October 27, 1999"}
{"Title":"Lots of drawbacks","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2HM0XVOHI5O01","Overall":"bad","Content":"Yes, it takes great pictures, but there are several things I'd change about it.  First, don't trust the wrist strap to hold the camera.  My broke in a matter of days and the camera plummeted to the ground.  It's extremely  flimsy for and $800 camera.  Second, there is a one-second delay between  the time you push the shutter button and the time the camera takes the  picture.  This is extremely annoying for users of traditional cameras that  respond the instant you activate the shutter.  It makes candid shots nearly  impossible.  Third, the camera is ridiculously clumsy to hold.  It's not  built to fit the human hand at all.  The user's thumb naturally lands on  the LCD screen, which is very difficult to clean after ; the camera fall  over too easily when standing on its base; it's very easy to drop.  Fourth,  the LCD screen is hyped as a great feature:  well, what Kodak fails to tell  you is that using the LCD screen while the camera's running on batteries  causes the batteries to overheat and freeze the camera until the batteries  return to normal temperature.  Yes, the camera takes great pictures, but  you'll probably be disappointed by everything else wrong with it.","Date":"August 2, 1999"}

Each has the same problem, it eats batteries like crazy.  You CANNOT use conventional alkaline batteries - not even KODAK brand PhotoLife batteries  - they last less than a dozen or so shots!  And it freezes up on occassion  and the only way to reset it is to open the battery compartment and release  the batteries then reset it by closing the battery compartment.  Three  cameras and all have the same problem - not good!  Not exactly the best  design either - clumsy to hold and awkward to use - not much thought went  into the design of this particular model while other Kodak models seem  better designed... not smart for the \"top of the line!\"No  wonder Kodak discontinued this model.  Now if they will only take it back  and give me one that works!

Not only can I can share photos with friends by e-mail, but I can crop small parts of the photos and these parts become great images in their own right.  For example, from an image of a croud of people at a graduation party, I  was able to print an excellent 8x10 of a couple that had just become  engaged.  I recommend buying and using a 32 meg flash memory with the 8  meg as a back-up.  I also like that the camera can connect to my  computer's USB port because my LPT1 port was already over-used.  The only  downside is that this camera EATS batteries (but probably no more than  other digital cameras.)","Date":"July 13, 1999"}

It  gives the best balance between picture size and storage.The USB  interface allows you to drag the photos from the camera to your computer.  You just highlight all the pictures and drag them to the folder you want to  store them in. It transfered each image fast but there is a long pause  between each picture.

It has a zoom feature to include exclude things you do not want in a picture.  It also gives you the choice of selecting the picture quality based on how you are going to use the pictures (i.e. on screen, 5x7's, 8x10's, etc.)  This allows you to increase/decrease the number of pictures you can take before being required to upload or change memory modules.  All the selections can be made on the camera using the onscreen display.  The camera has a lot of functions and can also transfer picture using the infra-red connector.  It comes with software and cables to connect to your computer in the case that you don't have an infra-red port.  Overall I would rate this camera 4 of 5 stars.","Date":"January 18, 2002"}

Now comes with NiMH  batteries which last a long time, and comes with a plug-in charger.  Actually is a great looking camera-will impress your friends. Has its own  internet-upgradeable OS, easy to use, but gives you many options for  shooting, much like a full featured 35mm SLR. CONS: Tiny optical  viewfinder, takes some getting use to.

{"Title":"Excellent first digital camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3E1S1BT1W0RDB","Overall":"good","Content":"I did alot of research on digital cameras before settling on this one. I purchased the DC265 with the lens kit (fun to play with) and a 32MB card with PCMCIA adapter. The PCMCIA adapter is excellent and works very easily  with my PowerBook G3 (OS9) and Windows 95 and 98 laptops I also use. The  card appears as a hard disk on your desktop and the photos can be edited,  copied, deleted, renamed, etc. right on the card - VERY COOL! If you wanted  to you could use the card to back up just about any type of data, not just  photos! Photoshop plugin is also useful. You will also want the optional AC  adapter. Photo quality is excellent even on the lowest resolution and  superb on the highest! The only cons are a (sort of) noisy lens movement on  zoom, and the fact that closeups don't come out framed exactly right since  the lens and viewfinder are a bit off from one another it seems. After a  few practice shots you will easily figure out how to compensate for this,  however. You will get used to the slight digital delay when taking a photo,  as mentioned in other reviews, but it is not a show-stopper. LCD is very  useful and the batteries (and included charger) are great and last a long  time, even with the LCD on. At low resolution/best quality setting you can  easily fit 200 pictures on the 32MB card! This camera wins my vote unless  you can afford one of the $2000 models!","Date":"December 4, 1999"}

{"Title":"great potential but it's the little quirks that kill it","Author":"Wayne Chung \"c4victor\"","ReviewID":"R2BFVE5M3GQNYS","Overall":"good","Content":"Kodak DC265 is fine for medium/long range subjects.  However, because the viewfinder and the lens are off-center, you invariably get off-center results - unless you use the LCD as your main viewfinder (this eats battery  life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot  decisions).  However, the image quality is quite good for most  outdoor/lighted conditions.The interaction and placement of the  controls are quite good. There are a few key rubber finger and grip  affordances to make the shooter feel in control.  The only cheap part is  the zoom lever.  It's a small horizontal lever, that has to be kicked way  over to one side or the other, and the time delay to lens movement is  sluggish.  The overall construction of the entire body and finish is very  nice. There's plenty of standard features like burst, time-lapse, etc. to  keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy.  A real nice package bonus was  the 4, AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger + 16MB storage card.  At  least Kodak was thinking about the entire user experience.Oh, the  software interface is rather silly.  The childlike icons and metaphors for  album creation, etc. makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model  for what is essentially folders/files on your computer.

I'm not an overly technical person -- my previous 35mm cameras were basic \"point and shoot\" models, with zoom capability.  But I found the  DC240 extremely easy to set up and use, and I especially like the  near-macro capability (you can get within 6-8\" of your subject and  still have a crystal clear picture.).The on-camera menu is superb --  colorful, very easy to understand -- and I found myself taking good quality  shots immediately.  I also purchased an extra 8MB compact flash memory  \"card\" which came in handy during my first extended use (a  weekend get-away to a scenic area with lots of attractions).  I found it  very easy to review my shots and eliminate any that weren't quite what I  wanted, instead of wasting the shot and having to wait until I got the film  developed to discover that the shot was less than optimal.  I managed to  get a total of 49 color pictures of PRINT quality (as opposed to email  quality -- you have a choice on a picture-by-picture basis) on the two  memory cards (total of 16MB) in this first extended use.  I also managed to  take the pix, review them several times, connect to my home computer, and  upload the entire contents of both chips to my hard drive before the first  batteries (AA -- easy and inexpensive to puchase) ran out.

{"Title":"Best Picture Quality but WATCH OUT!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3HOJ6B5F2MIK2","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the perfect camera for indoor shots but without the option of additional lenses, you cannot get close enough to your outdoor pics to make a good image.Also, the camera does some focus touchups but if your like  me where you overly take a lot of images, and use a clikdrive, this focus  option no longer takes place and you need to stay as still as a  tri-pod.All in all, EXCELLENT camera, Excellent Picture Quality, but if  you have the money, get a kodak model with lense options.Dont forget to  check out photonet and get real prints mailed to your house of your  images..

{"Title":"Awesome value - very user friendly","Author":"Dr. Randolph Becker \"revrandy_\"","ReviewID":"R1VY2CLGWNXY2V","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought the camera mid-June, and by late June was covering a national convention requiring daily uploads to webpages.  Got rave reviews of the images shared.  The USB connection is easy and fast.  I found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution.It has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots, including some sky photography  (sunsets) that rival film versions.One does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures, maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash card.It came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature.  And the Amazon price  is at least $100 less than any other source!This would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography, who wants a  camera that looks, feels,  and acts like a familiar 35 mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers.","Date":"July 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great buy!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2FPBH24NTVUA4","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought it for the USB interface, but sent in for the freebie package of accessories which includes a PC Card reader, and use that exclusively now.I can compare it to an older Sony Mavica, and while the picture  quality seems better than Sony's (and far better than I ever anticipated),  and the Kodak itself is more portable BY FAR, its LCD isn't as big or clear  as the one on the Mavica.  Of course, the Mavica doesn't have an optical  viewfinder so it has to have a great LCD, but I don't find the Kodak LCD  useful for framing pictures AT ALL.  It is plenty good enough for reviewing  your pictures (deciding which ones to keep or delete), and it's excellent  for setting the camera options (the UI is great!).Another BIG PLUS for  this camera is the zoom, of course.I don't like the included software at  all:  Picture Easy is a slow-loading hog.  I just use it to get the  pictures off the camera; then I open up my regular graphics editor to  view/edit the pictures; and I use a proprietary online printer's software  to upload the JPGs for printing.But overall, I'd choose this camera over  any other camera in its class.","Date":"July 15, 1999"}

I own another digital cam that was one of the first ones out that does not have a zoom or a flash.  What a long way digital cams have come!I have used  the DC240 quite a bit already and am VERY impressed with the picture  quality and the print quality.  I bought it hoping that I could finally do  away with my film camera for snapshots but was rather skeptical.  I figured  if it wasn't up to par, I would just return it.  It exceeds my expectations  already!I have also printed a number of the photos on glossy photo paper  with an HP DJ 722C.  The average person would not be able to tell that it  wasn't a film camera print.  I printed most of them at 5x7 but printed a  few at 8x10.  1.3 megapixel cameras are not supposed to be photo quality at  8x10 but my prints at that size look great.I have yet to find anything I  don't like about the camera.  It fits well in your hand, has a fast zoom  compared to my Pentax WR90, and is so convenient.I would highly  recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good quality picture at a  price that is very affordable.  I would also highly recommend Amazon.com  for that purchase.  Their price was the best anywhere on the net and more  than $100 cheaper than the local electronics chain.","Date":"June 2, 2000"}

The software is very good.Keep in mind  that digital cameras such as this are great for CERTAIN applications, not  for high-resolution images that you would use in a magazine layout or  anything like that.

{"Title":"Incredible Pictures and Easy To Use","Author":"Robert Berry","ReviewID":"R1HXG7ILGQK7HG","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a lot of agonizing and shopping around before biting the bullet and buying the Kodak DC240.  I had used and or owned 3 different digital cameras before this one, and was disappointed overall by their various limitations.  Here's what I recommend to anyone buying this wonderful camera.Get yourself a 16MB Compact Flash card (the camera comes with an 8MB one, but you'll find it's not enough to take a ton of photos without running out of space).  That way you'll have 24MB worth of storage to take \"on the road\" with you, which should be more than enough for the moderate user to store photos on before uploading them to your computer.Secondly, buy the kit that has the Battery charger and get 4 extra NiMH AA batteries.  Do not even bother using regular AA batteries in these.  You'll get a lot of use with the NiMH, but standard alkaline will be sucked dry in about 8 minutes.And finally, invest in a USB Compact Flash card reader.  You can find a good one for close to $30, but it will make transferring the pictures off your camera as easy as moving files on your hard drive.  SanDisk makes a nice one that's way too easy to use.The photo quality is magnificent.  If you take them at the highest resolution, you'll get a picture that's likely bigger than your monitor can even display, with crip tightness.  The colors are incredible, and the variable flash settings for different lighting sources are a great plus.And even the pictures at the lowest resolution are fairly crisp, and excellent for use for quick web pictures and internet auctions.There are really only 2 small pet peeves I have with this camera.  The LCD screen is very hard to read in sunlight (but ultimatley not necessary to use in a pinch, anyway), and there's about a 1 second delay when you click the picture, so getting that magic moment in a higher speed event takes some practice to take care of.You can't go wrong with this camera.  It's rugged, takes great pictures, and I'm 100% happy with my purchase.  And it's KODAK, so you know customer support isn't going to be a problem","Date":"November 16, 2000"}

I have had the camera for about 2 months and have taken hundreds of pictures.  I have been very pleased with the results.  Photography is a hobby of mine and, as a result, I am picky about picture quality and accurate color reproduction.  This camera is easy to use, fast to recycle between pictures, and the USB connection is fast and reliable.  I like the optical zoom (I have not tried the digital zoom).  The lens appears to be of good quality.  I have not detected any distortion.  Similar to other LCD screens, the screen on this camera can be difficult to see outdoors.  You can adjust the brightness, but this reduces your battery life.  I have experienced better than expected battery life.  With frequent use, I have replaced the batteries on a monthly basis.  Overall, I recommend this camera to anyone who wants good quality images that are manageable (compared to multi-megapixel images), easy to use feature set and a reasonable price.","Date":"October 12, 2000"}

The camera came a few days before I went to a convention in  Philadelphia, giving me enough time to learn how to use the camera.The  pictures are wonderful, and my collegues were amazed that I could show them  the pictures immediately, or delete them if the shot was bad.  I also did a  few shots using the timer, which worked pretty well.  Following the  convention, I was able to put together a quick web site with the pictures,  a faster process than waiting for the film to be developed, then scanning  the pictures, then cropping, etc.Overall, a good combination of  features, ease of use, and quality pictures.","Date":"July 27, 2000"}

My camera store recommended the DC-240. My one big mistake was purchasing it from them instead of from Amazon.Com. The photographs taken by the DC-240 are excellent, and certainly have all the resolution and sharpness I require. In fact, I have to use a photo editor to tone them down and resize them so they don't take forever to load on the auction page. My only complaint is that uploading the photographs from the camera to my Windows ME system is very much a trial-and-error process. So it might be a good idea to get a separate bypass unit that goes straight from the flash memory to the computer.","Date":"November 10, 2000"}

Also - As  said before, DON'T BY THIS CAMERA FOR THE SOFTWARE, the USB interface  driver is ace (1 picture per second vs. 3 per minute) - but as for the  rest, don't expect to use it - you'll need to get PhotoShop for picture  doctoring, the Adobe \"Picture Creator-Master\" non-sense crap you  get wit it will only work for about 2 pictures before it GPFs.

The menu and features on the camera itself are very easy to use, and there are some added features that i really like.  The lcd screen can be turned on and off to show the picture about to be taken w/special effects that were set (e.g. black & white) and has a digital zoom of 2X, which is very neat to be able to zoom in on things, getting two times closer than with the naked eye.  The camera has video output, which i havnt gotten working yet, dc output, which i havnt gotten working yet either, i think it takes a special dc cord...  and aside from those two the other main flaw is the cord to connect w/the computer that it comes with.  When connected the software takes almost a full minute to display 1 picture for editing etc, which is just simply too long.  I have the serial cable which came with it, but i suspect the usb will be much faster, i recommend buying it as an accesory.  Otherwise, the software works great, lets u auto enhance the picture, making it brighter etc, or you can edit it in microsoft paint, cut and paste and do whatever.  very cool.  I would really recommend buying it because if you go all out and spend a thousand dollars on a great 6.w/e megapixle camera, you will be very disappointed because in 4 months you can get the same camera at $400... when i buy electronics i go halfway, that is to say i buy a good product that isnt TOP quality, but very affordible.  this camera is great for that reason... the picture quality is just FINE.  i find it better than a non digital camera, and in the pc/mac software you can zoom in even more, showing off its digitalness by holding a steady sharpness that is great.  the only difference between this camera and a top quality camera is really, just the amnt of megapixles.  i find this camera to be everything i need and more, even if it has under 1.5 mp!","Date":"May 13, 2001"}

If I remember correctly, at the time this camera was over $300 but I got it for $50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it, but despite that, it lasted an additional 3 1/2 years before it stopped working; the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me, it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times, but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera, not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it, and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise, I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this, instead they make these plastic, cheap looking, cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera.

I attempted to use it the other day and the lens motor started making a noise and would not focus.  I called Kodak and they were not very helpful at all.  They said they had two repair costs, $110 for minor repairs and $275 for major repairs.

It turned out to be a great buy. It is a very easy to use and takes pretty  good photos. I liked it so much, that I ended up buying one for  myself.There are a couple of problems with this camera:If you use  the LCD panel(for previewing pictures you have taken), your batteries (4  AAs) will be drained - FAST.The 4 mg memory card that comes with this  camera is really not enough. I would recommend that anyone buying this  camera buy the 32mg chip. With 32mg, (and the 4mg card) you can take more  about 130-140 photos at the highest resolution (the recommended resolution  if you want to print your photos). This makes the camera great to take on  vacations - you don't have to worry about running out of memory.It takes  a long time to transfer photos to a computer. I recommend getting the  Parallel Picture Card Reader (from Kodak) which will make the photo  transfer lots faster.Buying these various accessories does add to the  cost of the camera, but it is well worth it.The print quality of these  pictures is pretty good (although NOT regular photo quality).  You can  upload your photos to Kodak and they will print them and send them to you  through the mail.  Also, they will set up a URL where your friends and  family can see and order your uploaded photos.As much as I love this  camera, I think that I will eventually buy a higher end version (maybe the  Kodak 260) so that I can have better print quality for my photos.","Date":"October 13, 1999"}

{"Title":"Great Camera!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2PGREBMJ1GC5N","Overall":"good","Content":"My Dad got me this camera so that our family could easily send photos home of our son (and us a I guess ;)  We've since replaced our film-based camera  primarily with this one.  We have and Epson Stylus 800 printer (highly  recommended), and we can print photos of comparable quality to normal  film-developed photos.The camera has a really nice user interface for  setting the camera configurations, viewing stored photos, transfering  photos to a PC, and deleting photos from the camera.  It is compact and  easy to use.  It also has a few nice features like a timer, and closeup  modes.The only drawbacks are, it doesn't take shots that require a  telephoto lens very well.  For example, I've tried to take a simple picture  of Mt. Ranier, a huge/stunning mountain visible from most anywhere near  where we live, and none of them turned out too well.  It also takes a while  to download onto the computer (for highest resolution photos it's about  18/10-15 minutes)  If you have a laptop I suggest you get the Flash card  PCMCIA adapter.  It allows you to get the pictures off the Flash card  lightnight fast.If you're looking for a good digital camera that could  replace your film camera this is a great candidate despite the flaws.","Date":"July 12, 1999"}
{"Title":"DC210 Plus - a great inexpensive digital camera!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R302V1UHQLSH7P","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera for two reasons a) to save money on film and development cost and b) to support several imaging related projects I'm working on - namely a picture CD, printing and framing photos, digital  collages, etc.  For the money spent (~$450 after add-ons) it was well worth  it.  The image quality is great, and the pixel density is good enough for a  decent 5x7.  On the down side, PC transfer is pretty slow - about 45  seconds per image on the highest quality and size.  Also, the picture is  ideal when the subject is relatively close - like between 4 and 20 feet.  Beyond that the results are not optimal.  Overall I'd say if you want a  digital point and shoot camera to replace your film camera, this is the  one.  If you are an amateur photographer, go for a DC260 or DC295.","Date":"September 22, 1999"}

Upon close scrutiny you would notice pixels at that resolution but that would be true for any camera of this calibre.  If you have a laptop and an adapter card for the memory card then downloading pictures is a breeze.  No Kodak software is even needed.  I do find the Kodak software useful for simple cropping and printing of pictures as well as slide show presentation.

Using CF memory, getting pictures from the camera to your computer is very easy.  It even works on my Amiga 3000.  If there is any problem with the camera, it is the short battery life.  You will go through a lot of AA alkalines if you use the LCD much, but that is not a serious problem.

Pictures were of good quality and all features worked fine.  After only a few months the camera's performance has dropped considerably.  Brand new batteries only last for about 12 pictures, the camera doesn't even power up at times even with new batteries. If you check the other reviews you'll find equally frustrating problems others have had with the DC210.  Consumer Reports' Nov 2002 issue contains Kodax's repair history which speaks for itself.

The software is a pain to install, and I tried installing it on at least thre different computers and got problems with all. The user manual is totally unstructured and Kodak use too much jargon and buzzwords to describe the simplest operation. Some problems encountered were: The memory card indicates a full 'magazine' of 19 shots, but when reviewing my shots on the camera viewfinder I get only 15. So I lose 4 shots somewhere. Try connecting to the computer, you get a myriad of problems, and to make matters worse, every time you need to stop the download, the software has to go through the same connection link-up procedure. The use manual is terribly written, you get two choices of software without anyone explaining in simple terms what each does.In summary, I would look elsewhere, e.g. Olympus.","Date":"June 23, 2001"}
{"Title":"A definite winner- Buy this camera!","Author":"Baltic Books \"Vic\"","ReviewID":"R2UEFKWZVXP60B","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera.  We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian \"ger\" (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.","Date":"November 23, 1999"}
{"Title":"Truly a great little camera, especially for the price","Author":"\"jeugenides\"","ReviewID":"R28RQHJKHM2A2W","Overall":"good","Content":"If it had an optical zoom lens, this camera would be perfect! But, it would also cost a lot more. The  camera is nice and small, fits easily in a coat pocket so you can take it  anywhere. Picture quality is great, a bit soft on landscapes but all  digital cameras are, even the 2 megapixel ones don't really do landscapes  that well. The macro shots from this camera look spectacular, and people  shots are just great. They print out very nicely, too. The autofocus works  very well, and the metering is excellent (you can adjust the exposure up  and down 1 stop if you want, but so far I haven't found it necessary).  Color saturation is great, and very accurate. You can't adjust the white  balance manually, but fortunately the camera's automatic white balancing  works extremely well. You have 4 options when taking pictures, SQ (standard  quality), HQ (high quality), SHQ (super high quality) and SHQ uncompressed.  SQ is 640x480, the rest are 1260x980, the only difference being the  compression used. HQ uses the most compression, and SHQ uncompressed uses  no compression at all (a nice feature that many cameras don't have -for  those really detailed shots). I find HQ works just fine for most pictures,  and I can get 73 of those on a 16MB card. The viewfinder is a bit small,  but not hard to find, and it's quite clear. The LCD is good, even in the  daylight. Controls are easy to learn and well laid out. It's easy to view  your pictures on the LCD, and you can delete any one (or all of them) at  the touch of a button. You can also protect any of them from being  accidentally erased. There's a 3x feature that allows you to see a portion  of the picture a 3 times the size, useful for determining how sharp it  really is, or if you moved the cameral during the shot. The flash works  very well for its size, and you can easily turn it off, set it for fill, or  red-eye reduction. The panorama mode works great, even hand-held. I took  some shots of a church with the steeple way, way up there, using the  panorama feature, and when I assembled the shots later on the computer  (it's an automatic process) the result was tremedous. You could not see the  seams at all, even though I took the shots hand-held. Great stuff. The  camera is pretty sturdy too. I dropped it from about 3 feet and  (thankfully) it survived. The software is reasonably good, and I really  like the little Camedia thumbnail viewer. Downloading from the camera is  smooth, although a bit slow since it's serial. However, the FlashPath  adapter works really nicely and is much, much faster. The camera uses batteries pretty quickly,  but if you get some NIMH rechargeables you'll have no worries. Go to Thomas  Distributors on the web, and buy the MAHA MHC-C204F charger  and  8 NIMH batteries and you'll never run out. With the MAHA you can even recharge them in your car. Don't buy the Olympus NIMH charger, it only works with Olympus batteries (yes I tried it with some others and it  got so hot it almost caught fire) and doesn't have the features of the MAHA  (and it costs quite a bit more).  By the way, the camera comes with a  home version of PhotoDeluxe, which is an OK photo editor. Has the basics.  But you'll probably want something else eventually. I recommend PhotoSuite  II - really great for the price and very easy to use.  Anyway, I guess  I've rambled a bit, but bottom line I'm very happy with this camera. Going  digital is so freeing - you can take as many shots as you want, no film  costs, see exactly what you have before you walk away, and then put it all  into your computer to play with.","Date":"October 29, 1999"}

Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.","Date":"November 29, 1999"}

Do what I did and check the reviews.  Amazon's is slightly off mark. Most rank the D340R at the top of the \"Under $300.00\" class.  1280X960 TRUE megapixel resolution is hard to beat at $250.00 (what I paid) and the quality is just what others  have said....1st rate!Unlike Amazon's review, it IS a battery miser,  second only to the HP C30 (1000 photos).  The full motion LCD screen is the  only credible drain and not using it will give you well over 700 shots on a  set of AA's.My camera came with an 8mb card.  Amazon is incorrect in  stating 8megs give you only 60 standard quality photos.  It's 122 640x480  pictures.  If you plan on doing a lot of picture posting or emailing,  640x480 size pictures don't overwhelm the servers out there.  You get 36 HQ  pictures (1280x960)...4x the file size of a standard quality pic.  18 SHQ  pictures (1280x960 but with superb crispness and detail) fit on the card.  What am I saying?  You won't need to buy a spare card if you can hook up to  the computer every few days or weekly at the most.  I'll buy a couple extra  cards for any long road trip!A final comment on downloading.  Serial  cable connections are inherently slower than USB hookups.  However, the  Olympus D-340R's download time through it's serial connection is remarkably  fast...a lot faster than HP's and Fuji's....about 5-7 secs per 640x480 pic.I hope this helps.

In my opinion, DON'T  buy the AC adapter.  If you are using hi-capacity rechargables, you will  not kill the battery life by downloading pics into your computer.  Once  they are downloaded, turn the camera off.  People make the mistake of  editing their pictures on their computer and the camera is still left on.  Referring to only downloading one picture at  a time - use the software available from the Olympus website.  The software  that comes with the camera is junk.

I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV. Or  just use the LCD monitor! :)  -- From a happy Olympus/Amazon customer. :)","Date":"December 12, 1999"}

I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language, not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod, you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although it's not  documented in the manual, the camera comes with a TWAIN driver, so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.","Date":"November 4, 1999"}

Though the  manual has 183 pages it takes about 3 minutes to learn how to do the  basics. Truly impressive. I went on my merry way and shot a whole bunch of  pictures. Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software package;it would  be nice to have a \"Lite\" version of the instructions for use for  us novices. I'm sure the help section has an answer to every question, but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho, and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter, but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue. All in all I find this camera a pleasure to use  for a first time user like me, and I'm sure if you bother to find out all  the features for just about anyone. All in all a great product!","Date":"January 6, 2000"}

If this is your first digital camera purchase, as it was for us, you won't be disappointed. Ours came with an 8mb SmartMedia card which is plenty big enough for average picture  taking.  We also purchased the adapter to use at home to save on batteries.  In retrospect, I wish we had purchased the rechargeable batteries instead  and not had to deal with plugging in a cord, but the adapter works well.  I  can't tell the difference between the resolution on super high quality and  high quality.  They are both superb and as good as I've seen on more  expensive cameras.  Download time is reasonable and not a problem.  We  reviewed many other cameras before settling on this one and just couldn't  find anything else that provided this kind of excellent quality for such a  reasonable price.","Date":"January 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera, but here's some things you won't like","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3GSWZQBKTJGN1","Overall":"good","Content":"To find out what's good about this camera, read the other reviews.  Here are some things that missed the mark.  The manual is a human factors disaster.  The print is tiny, the table of contents is on about page 30, if  you can find it and they used that confounded \"all four languages on  each page\" format instead of four separate sections with black blocks  at the edge to make each section easy to find.  The software had a few  problems.  There was a little utility that appears to be a general camera  interface for Windows.  When I tried to set it up, I found that it listed a  wide variety of cameras but the D-340R wasn't among them!  It also came  with Adobe Photo Delux.  I've heard a lot of raves about this and other  Adobe products.  They were all from people who'd never tried competing  products. In other words, the software will do a lot, but as with the  manual, the human factors are terrible. They don't even follow the  \"Save As\" convention to output different file formats. With  Adobe, you use the old \"export\" convention.  I also found that  some of the JPEG's output by Photo Deluxe could no longer be read by the  other viewing software that comes with the camera.  I recommend you find  people who have other cameras and look at their photo processing software  to find a more user friendly program. Finally, the manual frequently  recommends using the AC adapter for some common operations.  Well, if its  the best way to go, why is does it not come with the camera?  You may as  well buy one when you order the camera.  As for the camera, its fairly easy  to use, but not before you've read the manual which isn't easy to use.  Once you've done that, the pictographs make sense and the frequent user  shouldn't have to consult the manual again.  A little more effort at user  friendliness here would obviate the need for a manual for most  operations.Does all this mean you shouldn't buy the D-340R? No.  If the  hardware turns out to be reliable, its price performance combination is  hard to beat, and the difficulties are all surmountable.  They just make it  an target for the competition.  If you need a good basic digital camera  now.  Buy it.  If you can wait, keep your eyes open for improved products  from all manufacturers.","Date":"October 21, 1999"}

It is easy to use (once you read the manual), and it's a snap to transfer images to your computer via the included serial  cable and software.  I am somewhat disappointed in the manual.  It is  difficult to read and it does't include all the information you might want.  For example, I was disappointed that it apparently had no Twain driver.  But when I browsed the included CD-ROM, I noticed it had a Twain directory.  I clicked Setup, and voila!  I now don't even use the included software; I  use my old friend Paint Shop Pro and the Twain compatible feature that was  not even mentioned in the manual!  One other little glitch I noticed about  my camera -- it does not erase all pictures at once except from the  software.  The manual explains how to erase all using the camera buttons,  but it doesn't work for me.  I have to erase them one at a time, or connect  to the computer and use the software to erase them.  All and all, it's a  great camera for the money -- $300.  Oh yea, and mine even came with the  rechargeable batteries and a charger!","Date":"October 23, 1999"}

{"Title":"High Quality for Beginners","Author":"T. A Nossem","ReviewID":"R1DKG0M5U00U20","Overall":"good","Content":"If you're looking for a digital camera that can not only handle web photos, but also some non-web pictures, the Olympus 340R is a good bet.I did a lot of research, including Amazon customer reviews.  At $400 in early 2000 (everything electronic has is relative to date), it may represent the  best value going.The pictures are great (don't rely on the autoflash  indoors...for indoor shots, set the camera for flash).  The operating  manual could be more user-friendly, but is tolerable.  Once you get the  hang of it, it's a very easy camera to operate.  The built-in shutter  cover, which doubles as the power shutoff is an example of simple  engineering genius.On the downside, you'll read that the 340R is a  \"battery hog,\" and it is.  Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride  batteries (get 8 + a charger) are a must.  I also recommend the FlashPath  adapter.  It's a great way to transfer your picture files to your computer  and saves on battery usage.Though I LOVE Amazon, the truth is that  you'll be better served if you buy generic versions of these accessories,  rather than the Olympus versions that Amazon sells.Another battery  saving technique is to avoid using the built-in mini-monitor to take  pictures.  You don't need it.Net, for $400, you can't beat this one.","Date":"February 5, 2000"}

It is better than I expected from some of the reviews and they for the most part were generaly positive.  I am still on my first set of batteries and have  taken well over 100 pictures.  I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.  It is a blast to be able to take a marginal shot  and not to suffer the cost of developing a throw-away.  If it turns out to  be good, GREAT. If it turns out bad, so what, you have not lost a thing. I  am satisified with the resolution.  It takes wonderful pictures.  I am just  an average user and clearly not a professional, however, I recognize a  quality image when I see one, and have taken 1000's of pictures with our  Canon AE-1.

{"Title":"An excellent camera with tons of features for its price.","Author":"dave920 (dave920@hotmail.com)","ReviewID":"R1AYSLEWQ7Z296","Overall":"good","Content":"For only $300, this camera is an excellent choice for anyone who needs to take digital photographs.  It has more features than I ever thought possible, including the ability to slice a picture into 9 sections and zoom  in on each one (on the LCD screen), and hook it up easily to a TV and use  the slide show function to display your photos on a larger  screen.Although the positives outway the negatives, there are still some  aspects I could do without.  I have had the camera for 2 days (and have  been using it very much as well), and already the battery low warning has  appeared.  I read that you should really use the AC adapter for doing  'camera --> PC' transfers, as well as connecting it to your TV.  I  haven't done that, so I'm sure those are 2 main reasons the batteries are  already low.Also, it is suggested that you use the LCD screen for  viewing pictures only, as not only does it eat up battery life but you can  take more steady pictures when using the viewer rather than the  LCD.Camera --> PC transfers are slow and you can get quite impatient  waiting for the included software to index/thumbnail all the pics on the  cam before you can do anything such as download, etc.But, for the price  it's an excellent camera.  You can save in .bmp, .jpg, and .tif using the  included software.  Using the lowest image quality mode, you can store  about 120 on the included 8 megabyte SmartMedia card, and they come out  exceptionally well, too.  4 flash features, zoom, and more make this camera  a necessity for the novice photographer or just about anyone.","Date":"October 17, 1999"}

The same money buys a lot more these days but this one has honestly been worth every penny.It has been used (and seriously abused) pretty much daily for 5 years and is still going strong. I have NEVER had a single problem with it.I've purchased 4 other digital cameras since this one, only to return them (a Canon, HP 320, HP 635, and Olympus D-390). Nothing beats the quality of the pics on my Olympus D-340R. I've never experienced photos with red-eyes like I did constantly with the others (I don't use the red-eye reduction - typically just point and shoot), and the color/sharpness are far superior to the others.The drawbacks are that there is no optical zoom, and I do go through a lot of batteries (but we use the LCD alot). The megapixels could be higher, but it works ok for me. Although I use it primarily for web use, I've found the SHQ shots print out superbly (with my photo printer).I recommend upgrading to a 128 MB memory card - I did this past year, and wowsa! I can take nearly 600 HQ pics or nearly 300 SHQ pics. I also recommend getting a memory card reader for super-fast downloading, because the serial cable is painfully slow. With a card reader you can also bypass the Camedia software, which leaves something to be desired.I am amazed that this camera has served me so well for so long!

This is a wonderful camera. I got it to take vacation pictures (in fact it didn't ship in time for my departure, so I simply redirected the shipment to catch  up to me enroute; I *love* amazon.com!!!!) and as soon as I got it I  started clicking away.I was a little concerned about the statement in  the product summary that said a set of 4 standard AA batteries would last  only about 60 shots; fortunately this is not consistent with my experience.  I took between 50-100 pictures a day and went through three sets of  batteries in 12 days; that's about 200-300 shots per set of batteries, not  the 60 listed in the product summary.Obviously it would still be better  (both economically and environmentally) to switch to rechargeable batteris  and I've ordered a set, but if you have to use regular batteries don't be  too alarmed by that statement in the product summary. Just be careful to  follow the manual's recommendation and use the A/C adapter when downloading  to the computer or other non-picture-taking activities.I had a few  problems with the pictures coming out too bright or too dim but I found  that by following the hints in the manual (enable/force/disable the flash,  or point and half-click to set the exposure before the actual shot, etc) I  was able to get good results and for the ones that came out too bright or  dim I was able to fix them by adjusting the brightness using the supplied  'CAMEDIA Master' software.To reiterate: Great camera!

I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.  It is a blast to be able to take a marginal shot  and not to suffer the cost of developing a throw-away.  If it turns out to  be good, GREAT. If it turns out bad, so what, you have not lost a thing.

{"Title":"Great features, great price","Author":"Juan","ReviewID":"R11840HHXFU2ZW","Overall":"good","Content":"The D340R does a very nice job for the money. It would be nice if the camera had more of a zoom feature, but that's probably its only shortcoming.Best results come with the HQ mode. You can save up to 36  pix on 8MB card in the HQ mode. The SHQ mode provides less JPG compression  and a truer image, but the tradeoff is that you can only save 18 images on  an 8 MB card. I haven't noticed any real improvement with the SHQ mode and  -- in my opinion -- the pictures actually look more pixelated in the SHQ  than in the HQ. The JPG compression of the HQ mode smooths the gradients a  bit more, it seems. So HQ mode it is for me on almost every shot. The LQ  mode is only 640x480, and the image quality deteriorates rapidly if you try  to do any zooming or cropping on LQ pictures.I print my photos on an  Epson Stylus Photo 750 printer. In most cases, the output looks to the eye  to be genuine photo quality. As mentioned above, if you try to do blow up  pictures too much -- especially in LQ mode -- the image quality  deteriorates visibly.Battery life has not been a problem for me, but I  use the LCD display as little as possible. I only use it to review pictures  already taken, not to frame or compose shots. I use the viewfinder to  compose. You get a little more in the picture than what you actually see in  the viewfinder, so it's not likely that you'll cut someone's head off in  the picture.I download pictures using the serial cable (included).  Download is rather slow, and it takes several minutes to dump an entire  full camera's worth into the computer. I haven't figured out if there's a  way to select just a few thumbnails off the camera and not download the  whole set of thumbnails. Once you have the thumnails downloaded, though,  you can select only those you want to download for real.The manual is  straightforward and easily understandible, and all the camera controls make  sense once you're up on them. You probably would have a tough time figuring  them out without consulting the manual, though.I hope this is helpful.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this little camera.","Date":"November 27, 1999"}

{"Title":"This is the worst digital camera i have ever seen, EVER.","Author":"Joe Conley \"noevilpeople\"","ReviewID":"RGBHRJAYMGADX","Overall":"bad","Content":"After a family member purchased this Olympus D-340R 1.3 MP camera, i will never again buy any product from olympus.  The first problem about this camera is that it has no zoom.  i cant stand a camera without zoom.  that might be enough to throw it in the trash right off the bat.  But theres more!  This camera eats batteries like crazy.  That is to say you put batteries in, take pictures for 2 minutes, and then it says the batteries are dead and wont let you take any more pictures.  If you take the batteries out, you can use them in another device for hours, but the camera says they are dead.  This seems to happen with only non-rechargeable batteries though, but still, thats another 10, 20$ you have to spend on rechargeable batteries and a charger, plus it takes 4 AA's when it should only take 2.  The camera is also very cheap.  The whole thing is made out of the lowest grade plastics i have ever seen.  If i ever dropped it i am sure it would break.  When you turn the camera on, the display on the back doesnt go on like it should.  The shutter button is often reluctant to snap a photo.  These features make it very hard for me to teach my not-too-savvy family how to use this camera.  The flash also makes pictures come out terrible for some reason, and i always find myself shutting it off to save the photo.  Not that the photos look anything better than terrible without it.  This is a 1.3 MP camera, and a terrible one at that after all.  Now we come to the worst feature, the software.  This is the most poorly designed software anybody could make.  Only a monkey could design software that was any less quality.  First off, IT USES A SERIAL PORT!  That might have been the height of technology in 1985, but anything less than USB is INEXCUSIBLE!  This software is very picky and choosy about when it wants to see that your camera is connected to the computer.  And it takes about 30 seconds to detect if it is.  Then it takes forever to download just a thumbnail of all the images on the camera.  And if you try to transfer more than oh, say, 5 pictures at a time, you risk having the software close on you.  Now this might happen before you wait the 10 hrs it takes to transfer the pictures over the rediculously slow serial port, or after.  I have it happen to me often after the pictures have supposedly transfered, but then the pictures are nowhere to be found on the hard drive, and i have to spend the 30 min re-transferring them.  The people at olympus are obviously not your friends, because i wouldnt wish this digital camera on my enemies.  NEVER BUY THIS CAMERA.  But if you do, spend the extra 20$ to get a smartmedia USB card reader.  It will save you the agony of using the Serial port and the Camedia software, which are both horrible.  Also buy rechargeable batteries, as from what ive seen, all olympuses like to eat batteries like theres no tommorow.  I would just like to emphasize again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY IT, ACCEPT IT AS A GIFT, ANYTHING.  If this camera was free i wouldnt take it. Well i might just to stomp on it 30 times and break it just to save anyone the agony of having to use it.","Date":"January 2, 2003"}

Don't count on being able to fill up your 8Meg  flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries!A second  NECESSITY is the AC Adapter.

Atlas","ReviewID":"R2E1AVI53AXFYM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the C2000 over the summer, and Olympus enclosed a mail-in certificate for free NiMH batteries and charger. The NiMH batteries largely fixed the battery problem (before, I had to carry a pile of spare  alkakines). I'm not sure how Olympus's folks signed off on some strangeness  in the mechanical design (wayward lens cap, oddly-placed strap attachment  things, power switch / shutter button placement). Also, the Flashpath  (floppy) adapter is a major pain to use. The PCMCIA adapter is simpler and  works better. A PCMCIA reader for a desktop PC/MAC is cheap. An included  case would have been nice. Olympus sells one for this camera, but no one  ever has it in stock. I don't even know what it looks like.Having said  that, I'm very pleased with picture quality and ease of use. Resolution and  color are excellent. The automatic mode tends to overexpose flash pictures  taken in some situations (like across a dark room), but the overrides for  shutter and aperature priority work well. You can also fine-tune the  exposure, among other things, and still use the fully-auto mode.Bottom  line: an amazing piece of technology; takes excellent photos (for a digital  camera); very good value for its capabilities.","Date":"November 21, 1999"}

I was amazed at the detail in the 1600x1200 medimum compression mode.  Pictures can be enlarged about 400% without noticing grain.However; then I had to  purchase a camera case to keep it in.  (This was very hard to find because  of the odd shape of the camera.  None of the \"off the shelf\" ones  fit well.  I had to settle for one much larger than the camera because of  the odd shape.)  Then after the first 20 pictures I had to replace the  disposable batteries that came with the camera with rechargable batteries  and a battery charger.  (It eats batteries - BIG TIME.)  Then I had to  get a lens cap keeper.  (The camera \"spits\" the lens cap on the  floor if it is left on the camera, when the camera is turned on.)  Then  I had to get an additional 32 meg smart media card.  (Since I wanted to  take more than 8 quality pictures without downloading.)Then I had to get  a USB smart card reader to download the pictures in an acceptable amount of  time without running down the rechargable camera batteries.Now, all I  need to get is a photo quality printer to print some of the pictures that  I've taken......Bottom line,  it took me $1,300+ to get the camera set  up the way I wanted.  I feel the camera case, rechargable batteries,  bettery recharger, lens cap keeper, 32meg smartcard and USB reader should  have been included with the camera...

{"Title":"This camera is the best because of its lens","Author":"J. S. Gilbert","ReviewID":"RLZVJ3KQJ3S1Z","Overall":"good","Content":"Most people don't realize that the best thing about the Olympus C-2000 is that its zoom lens goes from an aperature of f2.0 to an aperature of f2.8. Most people don't even know what an aperature is or why a 2.0-2.8 range  is good. So if you're like most people then let me explain.A lens that  has a 2.0 rating lets in more than twice as much light as a lens with a 3.5  rating, like the Nikon CoolPix 950. Therefore, if you are indoors, and you  want to take a picture without a flash (which is highly recommended to  preserve natural-looking colors instead of washed out pictures of people  with red eyes), then the Olympus C-2000 is definitely the best camera.  Also, the C-2000's form factor is better than Nikon or anybody else. The  camera is small and light, and feels well-made as you hold it. The Nikon  however feels flimsy and the zoom responds slower. The Nikon is in two  pieces as well, connected by a swivel joint. That seems more likely to  break, and I don't see why having a swivel joint is important or  useful.Overall, in my two years of working at a camera store, the C-2000  is the first digital camera to deserve true merit. It's well priced and has  image quality comparable to models costing ten times as much. Also the lens  is a high quality aspherical Olympus element. I wouldn't recommend anything  else.jonathan s gilbert","Date":"September 13, 1999"}

The 2020 Z can be had for about the same $$$ as the 2000. The lack of sound when recording quicktime movies isn't really a concern. I think I'll  wind up buying a Sony digital 8mm camcorder soon anyways...I also bought  a microtek CameraMate smartmedia card reader (USB) to hook up to my PC. Had  to upgrade the PC from win95 to 98 though, in order to activate the usb  ports.I bought an additional 32MB smartmedia card and a Flashpath floppy  adapter, as well. The flashpath works just fine, but it's slow. Also, you  have to install the special flashpath software before using it, which  Olympus does not tell you in advance. So you need to keep the software with  you if you want to be ready to move files to \"any\" pc. Other than  that, it's OK. I mostly got it for ease of connectivity between my home and  work pc's, laptop, etc.For the price of the C2020Z, the flashpath  adapter should be included, as well as the case. expect to shell out  another c-note if these are important to you. It would also be nice if  Olympus had designed a special one-piece battery for the 2020Z, as many  manufacturers do. Transferring the four AA-size batteries in and out each  time for recharge is a pain in the neck.Overall, these are minor gripes.  The camera is outstanding in every other way, and I highly recommend it.","Date":"February 8, 2000"}

When my wife and I were researching this buy  we decided against disk storage camera's (our friends have them) because  the disk drive is just something else to eat the batteries.  Also the  C-2000 can take a 32MB smart media card which greatly increases picture  capacity at higher resolutions -  about 489 standard, 64 high, and 32  TIFF...it will take about 120 standard with its included 8MB card.  I  already upgraded the card and bought an AC adaptor (not included)...and the  charger for the batteries is on the way.  I will not use alkaline batteries  again.  Right now I am using lithiums and I am seeing about a 4-5X greater  life over alkaline.  My friends who had digital said that it is better to  not take pictures using the LCD screen...I agree, we use the view-finder,  then check the pictures with the LCD (eats the batteries).  I am sure I  will be happy with this camera for years.  Good advice is to read the whole  instruction book right away, the camera does a lot more than I thought it  would.  By the way, we bought the camera in a retail store (going on  vacation, wanted it NOW) and even with comparision shopping we now wish we  got it on-line.

It makes sharing pictures with friends as you take them so much fun, and if the picture is poor, you can erase it and make another.  I have experience with cameras for 50 years,  and I know the technical stuff pretty well.  This camera has the  flexibility of a good SLR with a 35-105 zoom.  I bought a cheaper Olympus  without an optical zoom first. That camera was fun for a beginner, but a  true optical zoom makes this a dream of a machine. Put a lens cap saver on,  tuck the camera into a small waistpouch, and enjoy a quality camera with  great portability.  I take it everywhere.  Also, get an AC adaptor and  battery charger.  The 32mg card holds over 60 photos in the compressed HQ.  I love it!  PCMagazine (Nov. 16, 1999) rates it higher than the Nikon  Coolpix 950 for the serious photographer. Of course, the big plus is being  able to manipulate the photo in an editing program like the included  PhotoDeluxe or even better in Photoshop. I enjoy importing the pictures  into a program like Printmaster and making montages of picture shoots.

I like the Kodak controls better, but  the Olympus fits my hand well.  The power switch on the Olympus is where  the shutter should be, and, the menu commands (such as delete last picture)  are not terribly intuitive.  Also, the flash is closer to the lens than the  Kodak, so red-eye is more of a problem.  But, the 3x zoom makes the  difference for me, we'll learn how to use the controls.  Definitely get  a USB PC Card reader to move the pictures to your PC, the serial connection  is VERY slow.  Finally, Olympus makes the mistake of giving you regular  alkaline batteries in the box. Throw them out, get some NiMH batteries and  avoid the frustration of having your batteries fail after 5 pictures and  thinking that something is wrong with the camera.","Date":"November 1, 1999"}

I was was very happy with it, got many high resolution pictures with an excellent color reproduction. I got my C-2000 because I wanted the next  generation features in a smaller package. C-2000 preserves the high quality  of the optical 3X zoom subsystem, while making it smaller. I like the new  1600 by 1200 pixel resolution, since I print a lot of 5x7 and 8x10  pictures. The color reproduction is excellent, as good as a 35mm film. The  new electronics in the camera is impressive: much more memory, faster  processor, more sensitive CCD. Now, I am able to take multiple pictures in  a burst mode, a useful feature when there is a lot of action. I delete the  frames I don't need at the later time. Also, the time between taking single  pictures is much shorter, especially if flash is not used. The new CCD  makes it much easier to take pictures in the low light conditions. A lot of  digital cameras have difficulties auto-focussing in these situations. I  also like the new feature of being able to play the slide show directly to  the TV through a video output on the camera. It is great for parties,  especially with kids. They like to see themselves on the TV, only minutes  after the picture is taken. I got the 32MB SmartMedia memory card. The  included 8MB card is OK, but the capacity is insufficient for high-res  pictures. (Make sure you get SmartMedia, not the incompatible Compact  Flash. Some Web sites don't know the difference!). This memory stores 64  pictures in the 1600x1200 high quality mode, or 32 pictures in the  1600x1200 super high quality mode (JPEG compression of higher quality, but  requires more storage). I find both to be excellent, but prefer SHQ mode  for 8x10 printing. I got the USB Smart Media reader. It transfers the  content from the memory card to the PC much faster than the serial port or  a floppy adapter. You notice the difference when you transfer 32MB worth of  pictures! An improvement needed: the C-2000 needs separate buttons for some  commonly used controls, such as flash, focussing style, macro mode etc. It  is much harder to go through a menu to get to change some of these  settings. D-600L used to have this feature. Overall, I am very pleased with  the C-2000. I recommend it highly.","Date":"July 13, 1999"}

This camera is the only one that has all of the features that I wanted:  zoom lens, high enough resolution for 8x10\" photo printing, ease  of use, small size, comfortable grip, and the ability to attach external  lenses and filters.I was able to purchase this camera in time for a  vacation to San Francisco and I have no regrets.  It worked perfectly and  captured an amazing variety of photos in very challenging situations.  Each  8Mb flash card holds 122 `internet quality' jpeg pictures that look decent  printed on as a 4x6\" picture.  They look great on the computer screen.  The  really high quality 2Mpixel shots that look fantastic printed as an 8x10\"  print take a lot more space.  You can store 7 of them compressed (jpeg) or  just 1 not compressed (tiff) on one 8Mb flash card.What I liked: Powers  on fast so that I can take quick action shots, light weight and balanced  feel, 3x zoom lens, external lens and filter adapter available, LCD display  refreshes fast and is accurate, all adjustments can be controlled manually,  takes great pictures automatically, video cable is included and makes great  slide shows on the go, takes wonderful pictures in very low light  conditions, and it includes software to stitch together panoramic picture  sequences.What I didn't like: It takes about 10 minutes to download a  full flash card on the serial computer cable and the power button is too  close to the shutter button (oops, I hit the wrong one again).  You can  purchase a high speed flash card reader to attach to your computer to speed  up the download process.  Can't do anything about that power button except  train your fingers.Accessories I purchased and recommend you get: Extra  flash cards, NIMH high capacity batteries with a slow charger, the optional  external lens adapter, and a circular polarizing filter.  The extra flash  cards give you the option of taking more pictures in one outing.  The high  capacity batteries will make your life easier with less battery changes. I  recommend that you avoid buying a fast 1 hour charger for your batteries.  They apply too much current, make the batteries hot during charging, and  don't deliver a full charge.  Try an 8 or 16 hour charger instead.  They  aren't as rough on your expensive batteries and usually do a better job of  charging to full capacity.  You don't really need the external lens adapter  and polarizing filter, but they do help reduce outdoor glare for any  camera.","Date":"July 13, 1999"}

One should invest in a couple of 32mb Smart Media Cards - I highly recommend  Alix Memory Cards (800 580-6940) - they are competitively priced and offer  top notch service.  Also I recommend their Universal Photo Reader, it's  alot faster than using the cable that comes with the camera.  Your computer  treats it as another hard drive and transferring photos could not be  easier.  I didn't really like the photoediting software that came with  the camera, I went right back to using Ulead PhotoImpact.  You'll need to  get a good battery charger and a couple sets of recharable batteries - this  is a must.  Photo quality is outstanding for shorter range shots.  I found  that when shooting landscapes, the images were not as sharp as I would have  liked.  An advantage of the camera is that you have the option to manually  set alot of the settings, just like a regular 35mm camera, all the other  digital cameras in this price range that I researched did not as many  manual setting options. Cons:  When one is using the viewfinder to take  a photo it is easy to press the power button instead of the shutter button.  You'll need a strap to secure the lens cover to the camera strap, otherwise  it'll be lost in no time.

Very good in low-light with or  without flash. You can definately see that Olympus has been in the  photographic business for a long time and has brought its high standards to  the digital camera world.It has a couple of drawbacks though: 1) The  lens-cap must be removed before turning the camera on because the lens is  going to extend itself about two inches while taking pictures. That makes  it too easy to lose. Spend $1.00 and buy a lens-cap-keeper. 2) Not quite as  close-focus as the Nikon CoolPix 950. Definately spend the money on NiMH  batteries! As with all digital cameras you'll go through a set of alkalines  every 16 frames while NiMH will last through hundreds.","Date":"July 13, 1999"}

Further, I'm somewhat in awe of this technology -- I still cannot believe that I can take a picture and print it  out (on photo-quality paper) in ten minutes.The quality of the photos is  excellent, and the camera includes tons o' features that ease the  transition into the world of digital imaging.  I've also found that my  batteries tend to last 10-15 minutes longer than friends who own different  digital cameras (even when I use the LCD display constantly).The  included software is helpful, but I find that I am using Microsoft  PhotoDraw 2000 in tandem with my camera rather than the included Adobe and  Camedia applications.The only real beef that I have with the C2000 is  the location of the power button.  The power button is located in the  position where you would expect to find the shutter button, which leads to  some comedic moments when you line your family up for a picture, tell 'em  to smile, and then mistakenly turn off the camera.It's a small price to  pay for a truly amazing piece of technology.

I have read the reviews given here and I must say, I agree and disagree with some.  Personally, I love the floppy disk storage.  It's not  hard at all to throw a few extras in just in case you need them.  I love  the idea of not having to use any cables or \"special\" programs to  download my pics.  I will say though, I have gotten quite a few pics. that  were of poor quality (fuzzy) and then out of the blue...picture perfect.  I  use a photo program I bought from Walmart for $10, EZPhoto (I used it when  I scanned my \"old\" paper photos) and I normally reduce the size  of my picture A LOT to send quicker through emails.  This camera does have  an email feature though. Quite a few people said that you don't get a very  good quality pic. for printing, but I have to say I disagree.  Maybe the  printer they are using is of poor quality.  I have printed hundreds of  pics. and everyone has enjoyed them and are so surprised they came from a  print off from the digital camera.  One thing that disappointed me about  this camera is...for the $ you spend, you don't get a carrying case.  I  bought a cheap \"purse\" that looks like a camera case and has many  compartments to carry all the extras (battery charger etc.). I spent $6 on  it and it was well worth more than that.  You can't tell it's even a purse.  Another thing, I checked all over..stores and internet and the price of  this camera does not really vary...and if  there's a substantial difference in pricing somewhere..CHECK TO BE SURE  YOU'RE GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGER WITH IT!

It is an excellent camera and I certainly would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a Digital Camera at a reasonable  price. However, a couple of points about the camera. First, the LCD view  finder gets dirty and scratched easily. There should be a cover for it when  not in use. Second, it is almost impossible to see the view finder when  outside in bright sunshine, making it hard to take a picture. Cannot see  what you are viewing. I think it would be nice if Sony had put a regular  view finder on the camera for taking outdoor pictures.","Date":"January 23, 2000"}
{"Title":"Don't buy as your ONLY camera","Author":"Rob Olivera","ReviewID":"R189H8N1BET230","Overall":"good","Content":"If you take only 1 thing from this review, let it be this: THIS CAMERA IS NOT FOR YOU IF YOU PLAN TO DO PHOTO-EDITING (MANIPULATION)  Most of the photos you take with this camera will look a little blurry on your computer screen, and God forbid you ZOOM-IN on the photo using your photo-viewing program.  The quality of the photos is horrible (mostly due to the .jpg compression) and gives the photo a 'pastel-color' look to it.  The camera does have a setting to take better quality pictures using .BMP capability but when you use this setting you will be able to fit ONLY 1 PHOTO PER FLOPPY DISK.  Although the quality is better when using .BMP it is still not good enough for a serious photographer.  The LCD screen will get fingerprints on it if you even THINK about putting your finger anywhere near it and if you're under strong sunlight it is hard to see the image.  A viewfinder would've come in handy, however.. I like the idea of not having to put the camera up to my face to take a pic.  A necessary evil you might say.  If you DON'T have money to burn, do yourself a favor and either wait until digital cameras are a dime-per-dozen or take out a mortgage loan to save up for the FD-90 Sony model.  I don't know about you, but ...+ is not something I part with easily least of all for a camera.  WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: Online Auctions (Ebay), Unimportant pics.  Also, credit must be given where credit is due: For me, the main selling point of the Sony FD series is disk storage capacity.  This is a definite plus that enables you to share photographs with other people when they dont have a photo-downloading facility in their PC (in my experience this includes one hell of alot of people).  The 10x zoom is also a God-send. You can almost use the camera as binoculars if you want to.  The camera also enables you to format a floppy disk (at the expense of alot of battery life).  A fully charged battery will give u approximately 2.5 hrs of camera use.  In closing;  Get this camera if you truly have your heart set on it, but be forewarned about the day that you are going to want to take the PERFECT PHOTO.  It's not going to happen with the FD73.  Not in the standard .jpg compression it delivers, and not at the 640x480 maximum capacity size.","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more. 2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.  3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.  On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.  P.S.

I've used  it to document everything from the wiring and hoses on my sailboat to  furniture we might want to add to our home. Incredibly convenient, simple  to use. One thing to watch for: bright sunlight behind you can wash out the  LCD display so it's hard to see what you're shooting. So just find some  shade or reposition your shot.

{"Title":"eBay Friendly","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RYNFRYODDJRYM","Overall":"good","Content":"I needed a digital camera for listing auctions on eBay. Being that I'm a computer dolt, I sought out the easiest camera to use. The disc feature seemed easiest thus best suited and Consumers' report spoke highly of the camera. My photos are some of the best I've ever seen on eBay and it was a cinch to figure out and use. I have not used many of the bells and whistles, but habitually use the \"bright +/-\" feature: you click that feature a couple of times to compensate for the excesses of natural or man-made light or to get a photo that closer approximates the color of the item photographed. It works miracles and if, in order to closer approximate the color of the object, I end up with a dark photo, my computer software allows me to brighten the image again without distorting the color. Another beneficial characteristic is the clarity of the photos taken from close up. Holding the camera steady is essential. I often need extreme close ups if the object is a war medal or coin or token and get amazing photos by holding the object close to a light in the basement and photographing close up, such that I've got the coin in one hand held toward the basement ceiling and the camera in the other, with the camera between the light and the object so that light hits the object with no shadow. I'm beginning to use this technique for all my close ups of any object. Also, I'm using one of those spiral shaped long-lasting bulbs in the basement, but don't know whether that plays a role in my success with this technique or not. Another great thing about this \"close up\" technique is that I have total control over the light, and can see what image I'm going to get, unlike flash. It is obvious from surfing eBay that most sellers are not savvy to this technique. I sorely wish the camera had a hair trigger though. Especially when I'm doing the basement close up technique, where both hands are over my head and a steady hand is at a premium, yet physically taxing at my age (47), the click button is cumbersome, refusing to respond to gentle suggestion. This problem is distracting, but a small price to pay for the amazing photos that help maximize my sales. This is one great camera.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

BARROW","ReviewID":"R1431CTI14ZOBH","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned this camera for some time, and I couldn't put it down when I first got my battery charged!The Mavica series is a blessing.  The FD-73 is, I recommend, to be used for general purpose shooting.  The absence of a manual focus and poor quality photographs under low-lighting conditions forces me to rate this with only 4 stars instead of 5.  Photos appear too grainy under low-light.The 10x zoom is great.  The included NPF-330 rechargable Lithium battery is a godsend, giving you up to 3 hours of continual use.  Good idea would be to purchase an additional NPF-550 which lasts much longer.  I always keep one in use, and the other on charge.  The batteries will last around two years before they need to be replaced.  These batteries can be used with many other Sony digital cameras and camcorders.My biggest gripe with the FD-73 is it's resolution: JPEG's are only 640x480 in size.  The compression is so-so.  However, the picture effects (sepia, B&W, solarize, negative) are pretty nifty, although I only used the B&W myself.  Similar effects can be achieved using any good graphics program.  The LCD can be very difficult to view while outside under sunny conditions.  Another gripe is the white-balance: you can't control it.  Taking pictures of family against open scenery is difficult, making photographs appear to be back-lit.The controls were easy to manipulate, and the floppy disc can hold anywhere from 1 (if using Bitmap mode) to 20 pictures (depending on image).  Of course, you can fit more images on a disc using B&W mode if you prefer to take black and white photographs.I eventually upgraded to the FD-91, which isn't available on Amazon.com anymore.  As for the FD-73, if you're into quality, go for a better model.","Date":"October 18, 2000"}

I found this  not entirely true.  After reading the manual that came with the camera, I  found that you can use one of five special effect settings.  While this is  nice, the main point is that you can also chose exposure settings.  I set  it for action photo and took pictures of my nephews playing basketball.  Not a blurry picture among them.  What was really great was that I gave  each one a copy of the pictures right on the spot by bringing some old  floppies with me.  The nephews made wallpaper out of them for their PC's  and they and their friends think it's great.  While my other friends may  have more expensive cameras, they can't share the pictures right on the  spot.  Great for reunions when you only see friends and families once in a  while.  Instead of promising to e-mail or snail mail pictures, just hand  them a copied disk. Oh, yeah, you can also take a picture of yourself with  the timer feature.  Special Note: As soon as I got the camera out of the  box, I taped a clear piece of plastic over the LCD view screen to protect  it.  I read a previous review which said how easily scratched it can get  and seeing our other cameras here at work, I was not taking any chances.  Guess what? Looks ugly but protects well.

The floppy disks are very convienent for inter-office exchanges, and  it is not difficult to carry around a few extra floppies when you're on the  move and want to take a lot of pictures. I had no trouble at all learning  how to use the camera and had taken a picture, imported it onto my  computer, and posted it on the internet in about 5 - 10 minutes. It is  pretty durable too - I dropped it off the back of a speeding golf cart and  it was fine afterwards (phew).  However, as time went on, I found the  picture quality average at best. The camera does not take reliable shots,  and the quality can vary from excellent to extremely poor. I know how to  use a camera and how to take what should be a good shot, but too often the  pictures end up fuzzy or over/under exposed. I can get better quality  taking non-digital pictures and scanning them in (although this takes  considerably longer). Also - the zoom feature is useful, but like many  zooms, does not quite provide a focused shot. My advice: if you're  just starting out and looking for a quick and very easy way to take digital  pictures, this camera is a good choice. If you have any experience with  digital cameras or even a regular 35mm, look to spend a little bit more,  and get a lot more quality for your money. You may lose that 10x zoom and  some of the easy-to-use features, but I think it is worth the sacrifice.","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

Features are the descriptions listed by the manufacturer. Benefits are how using the product makes you feel. This camera makes me happy!

My SonyMav,  though, I want to take *everywhere* for the kick of capturing even the most  familiar and mundane scenes or objects in a new perspective.  I can see the  results instantly. I'm not stuck paying for bad shots and if I decide later  on that I really don't like a picture I can delete it and re-use its space.  I can share pix instantly by copying the diskette on the spot or later on,  by sending pix via email or posting them on the Internet.  Look at the FD73  pictures that are out there on the 'net (we're a proud and happy bunch,  wanting to put 'em all out there on our websites)-- they're breathtaking!  A missing feature of this camera, an LCD sun shield, can be made or  purchased inexpensively, as can a scratch guard.  The benefit of having an  LCD viewfinder means you can extend your arms and put the camera places  where you can't or wouldn't want to place your face.  You can take candid  photos without anyone realizing what you're up to because you're holding  the camera down, at or below chest level like you're just checking on  it.As to the features: read them, do your homework on the Internet and  you'll know what you're going to get, including the limitations and  problems.

{"Title":"A Wonferful Camera for Internet Use, NOT PHOTOS","Author":"Gary Robin","ReviewID":"RG8NW56AQ8NE1","Overall":"good","Content":"A wonderful camera for Intrnet use. For auctions, emails, web sites, Etc. this is a fine camera. The advantages are great macros (down to 1\"),10X zoom lens, comes with rechagable battery and charger, simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.  However this is NOT a camera suitable for Photos (Because of the 640X480 resolution) Do not make the mistake of taking important shots and assume you can get decent photos. For fine photos go to a 1 or 2 megapixel cameras. I also own the Nikon Coolpix 950 camera and recommend any Nikon or Olympus camera. Only the Nikons have great Macro capability (If this is important) A great buy for the money is the Olympus 460/490.","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

Armed with 50 floppies, we were able to takeunlimited pictures, averaging 15 shots per disk. Cheap\"film,\" total flexibility, no cables.  We deleted a few shots we didn't like and retook them.  The fact that it uses floppies is a major attraction.  Floppies can be used in both Macs and PC's, which facilitates sharing photos.  The 10x zoom compensates for the lower resolution.

{"Title":"Saves money in the long run","Author":"C. Manuelian \"carlm\"","ReviewID":"R6CZUDYMBHPUJ","Overall":"good","Content":"The Mavica MVC-73 is a good low end camera.  If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good \"snapshot\" camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera. How many pictures do you wind up enlarging?  I run my favorites on my screensaver and they look great.","Date":"March 27, 2001"}

{"Title":"Good, not great","Author":"Tracy Rowan \"dargelos\"","ReviewID":"R30DGHBU32S0IR","Overall":"good","Content":"For entry level digital photography, you could do far worse than the Mavica.  What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

It is easy to use and easy to upload pictures! I bought it mostly to take photos of items that I am auctioning online and it serves the purpose well. I bought it because I can put pictures right on floppy disks. I always use the \"fine\" mode when taking pictures and am quite happy. I also use it to take pictures of my neices as well as other general pictures. The pictures come out very clear when you are trying to photograph a small item from a close range and do not zoom in. The playback feature is very useful too and let's you know if you need to do a \"retake\". The only drawback is that photos that come out dark or on the light side tend to be grainy. If you zoom in as much as you can, the photos tend to be grainy as well. Great camera for the online auctioner! Great camera in general!","Date":"November 21, 2000"}

On the good side, you can use common floppy discs to save your pictures, the batteries last for ages and it's extremely easy to  use, but on the other hand the resolution (640x480 in hi-res) isn't good  enough for anything more than simple holiday snaps. If you're prepared to  do lots of re-touching you can use it as a useful image aquisition tool,  and the lack of resolution can be a creative spur intself, but for anything  more than simple web-site images and casual snaps you'd be better off with  a proper megapixel camera with some kind of smart-card memory storage.","Date":"May 19, 2000"}

{"Title":"Good camera for fast performance, low resolution results","Author":"Larry VanDeSande","ReviewID":"R1P4NG43L5MH3J","Overall":"good","Content":"I have used this camera since the late 1990s for mostly professional purposes. I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use. I don't know how this stacks up in the camera industry but it's a lot better than most of the electronic equipment I use in the office or at home.","Date":"August 23, 2005"}

{"Title":"I Love this Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RDM110MKZOQ2D","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a fabulous camera.  The fact that it uses standard floppy disks, instead of memory cards or downloading.  This makes it increadibly flexable.  I am very bad about developing film, and this format makes it  easy. Also, if I take a bad picture I can preview and zap it right there.  I took some pictures of my 4 month old son, that I would not have gotten  with a conventional camera.  By the way, it can be really heavy if you wear  it around your neck for a long period of time.  The battery life is  pretty good as long as I keep it off until I am ready to take a series of  pictures.  Also, to my surprise, it takes great high speed.  I took a  picture of a race car at full speed, that was beautiful.  I have,  however, dropped it once. It killed a couple of my pictures, but I expected  that with a floppy device.  The camera itself is fine.  One added bonus  is the battery is exactly the same as my Sony Handycam Camcorder.  Not only  do I have a extra battery now for both, but the included battery charger  charges both quickly and easily.  This also helps justify me purchasing  additional batteries down the road.I don't know what additional features  the step up Sony has, but this has so many features it will satisfy any  intermediate photographer.","Date":"April 20, 2000"}

Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say \"Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!\").At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!","Date":"July 9, 2000"}

The LCD screen is weak under sunlight. Suggestion: Try positioning yourself in a shaded area. The 120 min. battery empties much faster than that!

When it was brand new, my wife got hit by a wave at the tip of Cabo San Lucas with the camera around her neck.  The camera was in a case but the wave was so strong, water and sand actually got in the camera.  We dried it out and it didn't affect camera function at all.  That was a huge relief because three years ago this camera sold for $500.  I use it at work a lot to take pictures at office functions.  Everyone is amazed I can pop the disc in any computer and email or print the pictures instantly.  I have used it on vacations outside the US in Internet Cafe's to email pictures home.  It's best features are it's so easy to use and you can view the pictures on any computer anywhere in the world simply by inserting the floppy disc.  The only problem I have had with the camera is getting consistent picture quality in very light or very dark settings.  That may be operator error but after three years it still happens.

{"Title":"Digital starter","Author":"Susan Rush","ReviewID":"R2R0980DO9TKRF","Overall":"good","Content":"My first digital, after my old Canon AE1 gave up the ghost.  I needed heavy macro capability for shooting small objects, mostly for recording my student's art projects.  Delighted with the ease of operation and macro really IS great, but color balance can be off sometimes (vivid - but off.)  Blow ups are grainy, repetitive detail (such as background vegetation) looks like a bad computer-generated drop-in effect.  I bought it on sale well below list, so overall it's been a good value for me.  Suggested uses: Compiling a virtual student portfolio, close-up photos, teaching beginning photography or visual composition to younger students, documentation for inventory or insurance purposes, pet photos, etc.Suggested tip:  If formatting disks in the camera eats up battery time, format a bunch ahead of time and then charge the battery so it's set to go again.","Date":"June 4, 2001"}

The floppy disc is the way to go - so fast & simple.  My only criticism is the packaging by Sony.  The adapter for the battery plug  had rolled over to a corner of the box and I couldn't find it until I  started to put everything back in the box...even tho there were 10  instruction books in every language, the English language directions were  vague and you had to use your own computer savvy to know how to  \"format\" your floppys, plus there wasn't a warranty card  enclosed, but I contacted Sony via email and received one in the mail.

{"Title":"FD73 an okay, fun camera","Author":"Sandy H.","ReviewID":"R3A2ULOWIQA7MJ","Overall":"good","Content":"The Sony Mavica FD73 is lots of fun and easy to use.  The convenience of being able to use 3 1/2\" discs as your storage media is worth a lot.  The zoom and macro capability is excellent.  Having said that, the picture quality is acceptable for snapshots, email, and auction sites, but is a far cry from photo quality.  The images get very grainy in low light, and are quite pixelated if enlarged at all.  Reflections and very bright spots are not handled well...light to dark transitions are coarse.  You'll be able to get decent prints up to about 5X7, but beyond that things start to get a bit fuzzy.  I've had great fun with this camera and enjoy using it, but I'm currently shopping for an FD88 to improve the image quality.","Date":"December 23, 2000"}

The floppy is terrific because it is easy to use even for the 'analog' generation. You can always take the floppies to a pal's house or to Kinkos to print out photos if you don't have a computer or printer. PLUS you don't need to know anything about computers to use this camera. I took this camera on a trip around the world for the millennium, it went to the Democratic National Convention and has been at my side for scores of conferences. I've probably taken more than 3000 photos with it. Most I would rate at about 80-85 on the l00 percent scale. Not perfect BUT very acceptable.Enjoy your camera, you can get it at a great price now.

{"Title":"Works out pretty well, but not always","Author":"Zagnorch","ReviewID":"R3KVDBMXDU2LPO","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using this particular model for three years. I use it mainly to take pics of the various items I sell on eBay, and I've found it to be fairly reliable, although the picture quality & resolution isn't always consistent. Some of my photos will be reasonably crisp & clear; others will be a bit muddy. Of course, this could just be due to a lack of photography skills on my part, since my parents also own one of these, and their photos consistently come out nice and clear. They use theirs to take reference pics and event photos for the various organizations they're involved in.The Mavica MVC-73 is okay for taking outdoor & social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably well-lit, and the proper picture-type settings are being used. Unfortunately, the flash function for darker occasions isn't all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject(s), and has a limited range of about eight feet (approx. 2.5 meters). Beyond that, you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.The camera also features a playback mode, where you can review the previous pics in the disc. It's a good thing to have in case you're not sure if the last snap you took came out well or not. In my case, usually not! Another nice feature is the auto shut-off, which kicks in after about two minutes of disuse. Although the battery is stated to last for up to 2.5 hours, I've never gotten more than an hour and 50 minutes from a ful charge. Never the less, a `full' cell will usually last me a week or so, since I don't use it too much. One somewhat inconvenient thing about the battery, though: you have to remove it to recharge it, instead of just plugging it directly into an AC adapter/charger. And even though the storage on 3.5 inch disks is convenient in one sense (I can download the pics from the disk into the hard drive faster), the limited capacity of the disk can be a problem. At most, I can get 18 images onto one floppy.Oh, and one last thing. I know this sounds a bit clich, but do remember to remove the lens cap before trying to photograph something! I've had times when I'd turn my camera on, and the view screen would be completely dark, when it should've been showing whatever the lens was aimed at! Speaking of the lens cap, it's attached to the neckstrap by a small cord. Although it has a small clip on it to hook onto the neckstrap, it never stays on! This isn't so bad if you're clickin' pics at the normal angle & elevation, but when you're shooting snaps of things on the ground below you like I do, that dangling cover in the frame can be a real pain!`Late","Date":"January 30, 2002"}

{"Title":"It has been a good three years.","Author":"B. M. Chapman \"bnio\"","ReviewID":"R1K7DZG5EH0NO5","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera was a gift to me by my parents before I set off to study abroad in Japan three years ago.  It was given to me with the promise that I would email photos back home on a frequent basis.  Since then I have spent two years in Japan and have taken over 12,000 photos with the Mavica.  It is extremely durable -- I have dropped it at least a half-dozen times from a standing height, and has been exposed to mist and humidity countless times -- and it still functions perfectly to this day.  The function of the floppy disk easily makes it the most convenient camera for email and quick uploading.  Though because of the size it is to accommodate the floppy disk, the camera is a little on the bulky size.  And the zoom is incredible!  The 10x optical zoom is still the function that has most impressed people who have seen the photos I have taken.  Yes, the camera has poor picture resolution compared to most cameras on the market, and it has been the one function that has frustrated me when I wish to take detailed photos, but the camera has served me well; a great rough and tumble digital camera.  Ultra convenient and superb in LCD viewing with quality and speed (most cameras have a jerky reaction to movement when viewing, not this camera), this is a perfect camera for a person new to digital cameras or needs one for quick and snappy photography.  I would have rated it 5 stars, but with the plethora of cameras out there today, this camera's glory days are over.","Date":"August 29, 2003"}

It is not necessary to take up space on the hard drive for storage, as each disk can be labeled and retained for future viewing and use. The picture quality is magnificient both indoor and outdoor...

Baldwin","ReviewID":"R1JH05K2EHUSOC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Sony MVC-FD73 yesterday on behalf of my husband for use at his school with children aged 5-11 years old.He charged the battey up and then handed it to me As I already own a digital camera and have photo editing software on my computer he thinks I must be an expert! I took 14 photographs, they had to be indoors as it was dark outside. Cats and dogs were  most unco-operative, but eventually I had enough pix to work on and transfered them into the computer, re-sized added captions and printed them out. I found the camera very easy to use. It was very quick and easy to transfer the photos from the floppy to my hard drive, and the results were pretty good, seeing as I had not even bothered to read the instruction manual. I did have problems with red-eye, which I could have corrected if I had not been in such a hurry. The photo resolution is not as good as on my Kodak camera, but for beginners and certainly for children, it was good enough. I liked the fact it was easy to use and had various diferent modes, the Fine Art one was good, I have a lovely \"Impressionist\" type photograph of my blue Burmese cat. If you want a camera that is fast and easy, as a starter kit, this seems to be a good buy. ... , but we always seem to have to pay more on this side of the pond than you lucky folks in USA ! My husband was very please with the printed out results, and he has taken them to school today together with the camera, for the children and the rest of the staff to see.

{"Title":"Thumbs Up","Author":"Deborah A. Woehr","ReviewID":"RUYYFWJVGQYD5","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.","Date":"February 3, 2001"}

{"Title":"Good but not perfect","Author":"A. Ball","ReviewID":"R31UI7NBD4CRBV","Overall":"good","Content":"Since I bought this camera in July, I have run over 800 exposures through it.  The Coolpix 950 takes some getting used to and the manuals are required reading, but this is a camera worth learning how to use. There are  two manuals, one printed and one on CD-ROM, plus the Getting Started sheet.  You need to look at all three; each contains information not present in  the other documents.The macro capability is phenomenal.  I have a  picture of a dime that fills most of the frame.  The ability to push the  sensitivity of the CCD to ISO 400 and to overexpose by up to two f/stops  allows even night pictures by available street light.  The enhanced speed  (at some cost in picture quality) also allows candids by available light.  The Coolpix is also quiet in operation, even quieter if you shut off the  discreet beeper that tells you that you have taken a shot.On the down  side, you will have to spring for rechargeable batteries.  I have gotten by  so far with NiCd batteries plus a fast recharger.  A ribbon on your lens  cap is also highly recommended.  I have also been having some trouble  lately with my off-record-play switch, and there is some barrel distortion  and color fringing in the lens at its wide-angle setting.  The lens' focus  at its landscape setting also seems a little questionable at high  magnification.  I also wish that the manual focus settings weren't so  coarse and that it were possible to do a completely manual exposure.  (You  can set either the shutter speed or the aperture manually, but not both  simultaneously.)  There is a noticeable delay between pushing the button  and actually getting an exposure.  This is sometimes a problem for candids  and sports photography and when working with animals, but I have still  gotten successful pictures in all these categories, and the Coolpix is  faster than most digital cameras in this respect.Other than these few  small problems, I am happy with the quality of the pictures I have been  getting, and it is small enough for me to carry on my belt for instant  access.  I could never carry a standard 35 mm camera with similar  capability around like that.  The Coolpix seems to be holding up well  mechanically, even though it gets bumped now and again.

The Coolpix 950 is my second digital. It's truly one of the greats with plenty of creative features. The macros are impressive, with distances less than an  inch. The Coolpix requires lots of time understanding the many buttons,  wheels and software driven features. It seems to me that the Nikon computer  people and their mechanical people could have made it easier for the user.  The available user instructions from Nikon, including their CD ROM  versions, could have been much better designed, even for old photography  buffs. Their technical service phone number is a toll call and I got busy  signals THREE times even after I connected with their menu-driven answering  machine. Their website tech help is very good, but not if you are in a  hurry. The camera is a major user of power so you will need long lasting  batteries like NiMH. I bought a rechargable ProPower Pack from Unity  Digital for $100 that lasts a considerable time. I'd rate the camera itself  a 5-star and the support and user help a 3-star, for an average of 4-stars.","Date":"November 25, 1999"}
{"Title":"A Hassle but Worth It","Author":"AFRED \"Allyka\"","ReviewID":"R1UJWMUBGCH746","Overall":"good","Content":"I use this camera with a usb sans disk flashcard reader, which I find incredibly convenient. I email pictures to family regularly.  The quality is matchless, but I have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over 1 meg. The quality is so exquisite, that (get this) got a  color matched fabric from a friend in NY based on a close up picture I took  of a printed upholstery piece.  I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.  I even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it.  I now have 6, having  asked everyone I know for one for presents.","Date":"December 2, 1999"}
{"Title":"Trying to decide? Get a Nikon 950!","Author":"College Professor","ReviewID":"RZ08SV56MF08S","Overall":"good","Content":"Background: I have had a 35mm SLR camera for years and was a weekend photographer. I knew  that to quicker exposure times on bright days, that I needed to turn the f-stop to a higher number, for  example. I took time exposures by mounting the camera on a tripod  with a remote shutter release...I  knew some times, but was  hardly a professional! Basic stuff.  I spent about 4 weeks  reading every review I could find on 2 megapixel digital cameras. It came  down to several options.  First, several  people tried to convince me to get a Kodak DC280 running about $400. I  didn't.  Why? Because it offers very little manual control  over the camera and Kodak appears to oversaturate  the colors  too much.  Second, I looked at the Nikon Coolpix 800 for  about $400 too. I didn't get it. I went to Best Buy's  several times a week and played with the CP800. The picture quality is  fantastic (see some of the  review websites), but it only had  a 2X zoom and offered manual focusing. It did not allow shutter or  apeture priority.  Third, I decided on the Nikon 950.  I missed out on some of the lowest prices on this back in  Mid-April, but found I could get it from Amazon.com for about $570 after  rebate. I avoided some of  the online stores with bad ratings  on the resellerratings.com website.  Why the 950? Well, I  have had it for about 5 days now and KNOW I made the right choice. Out of  the bag, it takes great pictures under an amazing list of  situations in automatic mode. But...there is  so much  more!  Yesterday, I took it with me to my son's soccer  game. I wanted to take some action shots. In  automatic mode,  all action was blurred. :-( But, I put the 950 into shutter priority mode,  set it to take  pictures at 1/500th of a second (it was  bright daylight), and all action is stop-action. It's great!  I've also used it to take pictures of the moon by placing the 950 on a  tripod and positioning the lens  against my telescope  eyepiece. I used shutter priority mode with exposures of 1/30, 1/60, and  1/125  of a second again. Pictures are stunning. I would not  have been able to do this with the 800 or the  Kodak.  How to get pictures into the computer? If you have a laptop with a  PC card slot, buy a compact flash  adapter for about $10. If  you have a computer with a USB port, buy a compact flash reader to plug  into it (I got mine for about $25). It allows 8MB of pictures to  be transferred to the computer in  about 10 seconds. No  waiting an hour for them to come over the serial port for me!  If you can afford to get the 950, do so. Also try to get some  rechargeable batteries, a compact flash  reader and a bigger  compact flash card.   Strengths: Great pictures in  automatic mode. Ability to set the shutter speed. Good zoom.  Weaknesses: Buy a NIMH charger and some NIMH batteries (there are places  that sell these on ebay  fairly cheap...I got 12 of these  1500Mah for $22). The included 8MB compactflash card is small.  Buy a bigger one. Similar Products Used: Have had a Quicktake 150 and a  Kodak DC50.","Date":"May 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Buy one!  But you can't buy mine!","Author":"PT Phil \"bajaphil\"","ReviewID":"R2M8TMAE721DWX","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is the digital equivalent to a some of the fine utility film cameras such as Canons' Rebel and lan EOS series: The camera is just as complex as you need it to be - whether you are a `point-and-shoot' user or  a need it for professional uses.  In my design business use it has far  exceeded my expectations.Prior to purchasing the 950, I would  take a product shot, make a print and tape it onto my monitor where I used  it as reference to draw the product into an on screen graphic.  With this  camera, I seldom print the `film' out at all - in fact in many cases I  didn't even have to redraw the product in at all.  A shade-tree calculation  says that this camera has saved me well over 100 hours in the three months  I have owned it.  Even at my low-low rates this is several times the cost  of this camera - even including the optional memory. The  resolution is high enough for everyday publication uses -- print or pixel.  A caveat here: the lens does not collect enough light to do studio quality  photography.  For this reason in most high quality still photo work it is  useful to use a tripod to keep the camera steady.  The `speed' of the  camera is roughly equivalent to ASA 100 film.While it takes  only a few moments to discover the basics for `point-and-shoot' mode it is  worth a few hours practice in the `pro' mode.  Few of the `advanced'  features are really difficult to understand and using them once or twice is  so rewarding that learning becomes an easy and fun process - especially  since you can erase the film and use it over!  With careful lighting I  can come very close to studio quality work which compares to my yeoman  Canon EOS lan 35mm. Particularly handy for me is the macro  mode - or close-up mode.  You can focus from less than an inch!  I  sometimes use it over my high-test scanner for documents because it is  easier and faster.  My partner (whose mechanical ability allows the use of  the toaster correctly 7 out of 10 times) uses it for online auctions and  has found it to be a blessing: she no longer shuns putting up the low cost  items due to the difficulty of getting an image.  She is still using the  point and shoot modes but they are more than good enough for this use. Notes and recommendations: Even a casual user will find the  need to have more than the supplied 8-megabyte chip.  I have a 64 and it is  more than enough.  Probably an additional  8- or 16-megabyte would do for  average use.  Uploading pictures using what is in the box is  straightforward but cumbersome and requires a serial port.  For not too  much money you can get a serial or USB drive that makes the CompactFlash  chip into a drive - plug the chip in and using explorer or your photo  software you can retrieve your photos just like any file on your computer.  (We have even used it to move non-photo programs from one `puter to  another!)  Please note that I have skipped over many features which have  bee covered admirably by the other reviewers on this page.In  this fast-moving technological era it is difficult to make a decision to  buy as there is another camera coming out in the near future.  However,  this camera will work for me for a long time and I recommend it to anyone  from the family album user to photo professionals for everyday use.  With  the new online services that will make you paper prints from your uploaded  images there are fewer and fewer reasons for cumbersome film and this  camera is one of the first to deliver print-quality resolution.","Date":"January 13, 2000"}

Once we figued out how to get the battery case opened (manuals are usually the last thing that I read), we were off and running taking pictures.  The whole camera  was rather intuitive and I was thrilled with the ease of downloading the  pictures to my G4.  We had also purchased a USB Film reader with the  camera.  We were surprized by how quickly the batteries ran out (about 1.5  hours of use) but have quickly ordered rechargable batteries.  This I can  see as the only downside of taking this camera on a long trip.  We now have  to pack a battery charger and always kep an extra set of batteries on us.  Picture quality was amazing clear (I could easily pick out the discolored  grout on my kitchen counter).  And I am VERY picture about photo quality!  Currently taking pictures that are 440k in size.  I printed up a picture  (epson color 900 printer) of my thanksgiving turkey and pasted in on my  fridge - a few people have asked me what magazine I cut the picture  from....  very impressive.

{"Title":"A Great Digital Camera","Author":"Bibliophile","ReviewID":"R3TNG50AT288F6","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a Nikon Coolpix (my first digital camera) about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it.  Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM \"point-and-shoot\" camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures \"on-the-fly\", etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  \"keepers\" on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that, given the  recent price reductions, I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.","Date":"May 24, 2000"}
{"Title":"Best Digital Camera Going","Author":"Thomas R. Jones \"tomjones1\"","ReviewID":"R3UFHFQIJUCD0J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned my Coolpix 950 for over six months now, and it was one of the best investments I've made.  The imaging is astounding.  I could read the numbers on football players on a T.V. in the background, of a dimly lit  bar.  I read the reviews in P.C. Mag which said if you want 35mm quality  you had to have a camera with 2.1 megapixels, but this baby exceeds the  quality of a 35mm.  Two things though, The software leaves a lot to be  desired, and the flash ram is way to small if you want high quality  pictures in any quantity.  The 8 megabyte flash ram that comes with the  camera will give you 8 high quality pictures.  But if you boost it (we  bought an  80 megabyte flash ram by SanDisk which is totally compatible)  you'll be able to take more pictures than you'll ever need or want.  We  went to Paris in June and took over 300 pictures (high quality), and the  Camera still had a couple of hundred left.  You probably don't need the 80  megabyte, but I think you would want the 32 megabyte.Also, while your at  it get yourself some AA rechargeable batteries (also high quality), because  you'll go through AA's like they are  going out of style.  People love to  see what you have taken in the little LCD screen and it really chews up the  batteries.  Also, the flash will use them up! If your going to use this as  a web publishing tool you couldn't find a better one.  I recommend that you  use a real digital imaging tool like Photoshop, or MS Imaging.  The flash  gives most people red eyes (real evil looking) and you'll need to brush  that out with a good imaging tool.  Also, you can magnify your images 2 or  3X's and not lose quality, and with a good imaging tool you can crop it,  lighten, darken, change color, and make thumbnails with a couple of clicks.  Hint:  Nikon View is cumberson to work with but you can speed up the  downloading by using it away from your browser. Load direct from file,  instead of from file open from browser then you can choose from the  thumbnails (right click the thumbnail, choose copy)then paste it into  Word,Powerpoint or Photoshop.  If you use Powerpoint, you have a built in  slide show.  Good Luck!...you'll love it!","Date":"December 23, 1999"}

He loves the CoolPix950 with the advanced mode, I use it with the auto mode for now.  Either way we get great pictures, especially with  the option to delete and a 32mb Compact Flash card.  To print photos, we  bought the Olympus printer that Amazon \"recommends\" and found it  to be small and flimsy.  We returned it (as always a good Amazon return  experience!) and bought the HP PhotoSmart P1100 with duplexer.  The best  thing about this printer is that you can just pop the Compact Flash card  out of the camera and pop it into the printer, and HP's software is FAR  superior to the Nikon junk that comes with the CoolPix.  A few annoying  features: (1) the delay between when you press the shutter button and when  the camera finally takes the photo. Hard to get used to when trying to  photograph your two-year-old offering his stuffed Pooh a drink from his  sippy cup (2) the flash is too close to the lens and everything with  eyeballs turns red!

{"Title":"A Mixed bag","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RGEM20CD7OBJN","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my Coolpix 950 three months ago. I had a Sony Mavica before. The Mavica was easy to use, but limited. The Coolpix is extremely flexible and can work well if you have the time to carefully adjust the proper settings.  Unfortunately it takes some time to be able to understand enough about the  settings to use them correctly. These are often a strange mix of software  and hardware settings. You can't be in a hurry to take a picture with this  camera.  Another negative is the considerable use of energy needed to take  the highest resolution photos. The 950 sucks energy from my NiMH batteries  at a surprisingly high rate. I bought a backup rechargable battery pack and  it goes fast too. On the plus side, the photos are great and the macro gets  you less than one half inch from the subject. I consider the camera pricey  and a bit quirky. I hope Nikon's next version is less of both.","Date":"March 16, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great!","Author":"P. W. Sheehan \"pwsheehan\"","ReviewID":"R1FC1KJ9NJ2S0U","Overall":"good","Content":"Great camera once you learn the menus and buttons. Advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy. I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a \"speed rating\" of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images. You'll also need access to a good, fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual. A copy center such as  Kinko's should work. This is not a camera for the \"instamatic\"  crowd. Hint: negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an out-of-the-box instant hit, but with a little creative work, the camera  does well. I may trade up to the CoolPix 990 in a year or two after the  price comes down.","Date":"February 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon 950 Recommendations","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R21VVBF1F2HBL6","Overall":"good","Content":"There's no need to repeat all the wonderful things about this camera. It's great! However, I would like to make the following recommendations.1) Get a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH batteries rated at 1500mah. The  alkalines I first used were good for about an hour. With the NiMH  batteries, I'm still shooting with the same batteries after more than 120  pictures, with no sign of drainage. Don't settle for the cheaper 600mah  NiMH batteries, spend the extra money and get the 1500mah rating. Also, I  recommend NiMH rather than NiCd, as the later is less environmentally  friendly. Radio Shack is selling a set of 4AA NiMH 1300mah batteries plus a  charging unit for $1 more than the price of the batteries alone. If you get  this, plus an extra set of 1500mah NiMH, you'll be all set.2) Get a 6VDC  800ma adapter, for use when downloading pictures to your computer. It will  give you a lot longer battery life. By the way you don't need the 6.5V  adapter Nikon recommends. 3) Don't use the LCD screen more than you have  to when running off batteries. Program the camera to keep the LCD screen  off by default. This can be done in M-REC mode. As far as I can tell M-REC  mode does everything A-REC mode does (including automatic focus and flash),  except A-REC mode forces the LCD screen on, so learn how to use the camera  and stay with M-REC. By the way, a quick peek at the LCD every now and then  is okay with the NiMH batteries, but don't leave the LCD on any longer than  you have to.4) Don't change picture resolutions unless the memory card  is empty. I've lost pictures doing this. If you want to shoot at a  different resolution, save the pictures first, then clear the memory card  and go from there.If you follow these suggestions, you'll find the  batteries last a LONG time, and you'll always take great pictures.Enjoy!","Date":"June 12, 2000"}
{"Title":"High Cost - Disappointing Outcome","Author":"Chicago Resident","ReviewID":"R1UKJTVAL9F29X","Overall":"bad","Content":"Purchased and returned the camera.  From an optical perspective and the quality of the images, quite a great camera. Considering the substantial cost, several items were very disappointing and caused me to return it on a  cost vs. benefit aspect:  1) The camera does not come with a recharger and  appropriate NiCad (or better) batteries. Regular alkaline batteries last  about 30 min. for normal use.  2) The connection to the PC requires a  serial port only. Would be a nice option to include USB hookup. My  computer's serial ports are all used for other devices.  3) An 8MB flash  card that holds a mere 16 images in the 'normal' mode. 4) When connected to  the PC, the pictures cannot be easily transferred to software programs that  can sort, package or send the pictures.  A cumbersome copy procedure has to  be utilized to get the pictures on the hard drive; from there they need to  be imported to the software. Even with a 450 Pentium II machine, the  transfer was slow (even at the fasted speed setting for the serial port).  The instructions confirmed that photo software does not recognize the  camera as a device to copy from.  It should work just like a scanner (from  a system's perspective).I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another $200+ would have to be  invested. (Batteries, charger and larger flash card) The PC hook-up could  be greatly improved and made more user friendly.  Considering the already  high cost this is not yet a good package. I was sorry to return it.","Date":"January 13, 2000"}

Price is a little steep, but quality outways the difference in price from competitors. the 950 will  download 40 pix shot in Fine mode from Simple Technologies cardreader to a  G4 in 11 seconds. It's a battery hog I recommend buying Energizer's NH15-AA  instead of Duracell Ultra. I shot 150 pix in the fine mode 46 of them using  the flash until they were depleted.  It's ideal for Web publishing, however  I shot several photos for magazine use and the results were  non-distinguishable compared to film. If your a tweekhead you will spend  hours trying different traditional photo techniques with this camera and  your results will be quite surprising. Some of my favorites are Slow  Shutter Sync, 8 second time exposure, and a very accurate white balance  that is crucial when shooting in mixed lighting situations.

The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 (shown here).  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 (3.34 Megapixels). It's a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive, and if you don't need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as \"top of the  line.\"The swiveling body on the 900, 950, and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down, or at your knees  with the lens looking up, and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display, because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras don't do this and it's really useful. It's  made possible by the fact that these cameras (especially the 990) are so  good at autofocus, autoexposure, and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot, not worry about  anything else, and get a great result.","Date":"August 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"GOOD: Image quality. BAD: No USB, distortion at wide angle.","Author":"Spiff","ReviewID":"R1MMP7CJFGDI78","Overall":"good","Content":"I own the 950 since the first days when it was launched. Since it is a product with many reviews, I will perhaps focus on a few positive and negative aspects I have found over this time.For positive, well, overall image quality is very good, colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes, you will still need your Photoshop, but in any case, even with high-end professional models, you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photo-quality A4 (I'm in Europe, that's about the area of a 17\" monitor) prints that people will mistake for normal photos (matched with a good printer of course). The firmware is very effective, but a few features have been improved in the 990, which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me, you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldn't work as good. My favorite aspect has to be the absolutely AMAZING macro mode. The 950 can focus sharply at a ridiculously small distance from the subject. This thing is almost a microscope. Yes, it can be tricky to adjust lightning in those cases, but the ability to focus so well at such distances really impressed me when this model came out. So to keep it short, I'm happy when it comes to overall image quality, color accuracy, and features the main problems with this model are:-Considerable barrel distortion at wide angle. If you do a lot of architectural photos or are just unlucky and pick a tricky shot (like a door for instance) at the edges of the screen, at wide angle, well, it is way too obvious sometimes. Few digital cameras offer high-quality lens that are completely (almost) barrel distortion free, but I can't help looking at some cheap digicams using Zeiss lenses and feeling that the Coolpix deserved better. At Tele, the problem is a lot less obvious, but on wide, expect some of your lines to be more like,well...splines. -No USB interface, no Firewire, no nothing besides the plain' old serial interface. Ever tried transferring 48MB at 115k? Well, let's just say that it reminds me the days when I used analog modems. A lot of patience is required. Again, this could and should have been released with USB support (which was widely available at the time).  -Big body. The camera is a big big, not cigarrete-packet size like some Canon's and other models, so, that might end up meaning that you'll take it with you less often. -Some chromatic distortion (purple edges, etc) under certain conditions.  -Forget about using Alkalines they will last 10 minutes. Go for NiMh 1600 rechargeables. The 8MB default card will only hold about 10 photos at maximum resolution, or 1 if you don't want lossy compression. 48 MB or 64 MB cards are essential. -Panel isn't always visible under bright sunlight (newer firmware revisions have addressed this issue, but it's still tricky sometimes) -First versions of NikonView were incredibly , to the point of the user not being able to recover transferred photos after a connection failure (that meant that aborted transfers at 90% of the card when you're using a slow serial protocol meant starting all over, quite fun). Don't worry, NikonView is now a lot more solid and, but I did suffer with the first versions. Overall, a very good camera that can give you very good photos (and that means printed photos). Also, keep in mind that the final price ends up rising, since you're likely to need at least the following accessories: A Bigger CompactFlash card (48 MB or 64 MB), At least 4 NiMh 1600 batteries + a charger, and a decent caseWith Zeiss lens instead of the Nikkor 7-21mm used and USB interface, this could still be the best 2.11 on the market.  Because of these details, and since I paid full retail $ when it came out, I'm keeping a star to myself...","Date":"April 6, 2001"}

I didn't read all the feedback here; I don't think it was as plentiful a month ago.  Summary: I think it will work out but the early  days will be frustrating.  We have two Blue and White Mac G3's and a Power  G3 powerbook.  If you have these USB dependent items, you need a USB  cardreader.  You also need AC adapter or battery recharger because the  batteries burn out very quickly.The other reviews have already panned  the manuals, so I'll just add that the documentation was a severe  letdown.This may work out, and the positive reviews posted elsewhere  have me optimistic.  It is a bit depressing to get the camera only to find  out you have at least a couple more purchases to make it useful. If you get  this camera, get the USB cardreader and rechargeable battery equipment at  the same time; you'll at least know how much the whole deal will cost you  and you'll avoid the disappointment of having an 80% usable unit on the day  of delivery.","Date":"December 12, 1999"}

I have Nikon 35mm cameras and like them. My Coolpix camera works fine and picture  quality is good, but, except for size, I think the Sony is superior in  almost every way.My biggest gripes about the Nikon are the cheesy,  print-it-yourself manual and absolutely maddening software that come with  it. The print-your-own instructions with the software are very confusing  and I don't believe I ever successfully printed the entire manual. I have  also never figured out how to download the camera itself (I can't get the  program to recognize the camera).  I ended up buying a Compact Flash reader  (if I were designing a camera, Compact Flash would be dead last on my list  of preferred memory cards.) and another software program which adds a  couple hundred dollars or more to the price of the camera. A decent sized  Compact Flash card will add another hundred or so (and then there are the  batteries and charger). If you take this camera on a vacation, you'll need  to bring your computer or several hundred dollars worth of memory  cards.For a camera in this price range, I think Nikon would be wise  include decent, already printed manuals and user-friendly software.","Date":"November 3, 1999"}

My first venture into  digital at 640 X 480 gave me a wish list of what it would take to satisfy  the quality requirements for serious photography.  A new, Hi resolution  printer paved the way for the arrival of the Coolpix 950 into my evolving  'desktop darkroom'. The quality / format range of basic 640 X 480 to XGA  Fine, to Uncompressed TIFF is magnificently supported by Nikon's superb  optics, accurate exposure options, adequate zoom range and very usable  macro.  From my Siamese Cat's eyes, to a handmade silver Hopi ring, to  mountain landscapes, all can be reproduced in astoundingly fine detail,  given a good quality printer.  The camera features may not be readily  apparent, but just carry around the Fast Track Guide for a couple of photo  sessions & it will give you the answers to all you want to know.  They laughed when I arrived with only a camera in it's belt-pack and 4  extra batteries - hardly enough size to be a professional quality camera -  compared to the kid with a full sized 35mm camera with huge flash and  massive zoom lens.  Later that evening, I was able to present  suitable  albums to both parents to show off with, while the kid with the 35mm was  still talking about availability of overnite photo-processing.  The 8 X  10's printed later were truly impressive.  On the down side, the  proprietary accessory flash connector eliminates use of a second source  light of my choosing - desirable in some instances, but not manditory.  As  in all high-drain applications, a pocket full of AA Alkalines will work.  Better than rechargeable NiCad's (even the high capacity ones) are the NiMH  batteries, which although expensive, far outlast any of the other  rechargeables. The 8 meg flash card is a good starter, but 32 - 80 meg  gives this little camera sufficient capacity for most photo situations.  If you need a camera solely for family snapshots & e-mail photos, you  won't begin to appreciate this camera's ability.  If you need to capture  Mai-Tai's brlliant blue eyes, the shy smile of a new bride at the altar, or  fine details of the jeweler's craft, then you will be able to exploit the  950's full potential.  Now, will I go out & sell the Olympus?  Doubtful, since they have the sentimental value of worldwide travel.  And  besides, they really do take wonderful slides...","Date":"October 20, 1999"}

{"Title":"Outstanding, but be aware of limitations...","Author":"G. Oh \"gadget fanatic\"","ReviewID":"R3HCHC7VH5S1QO","Overall":"good","Content":"Had this a little over a year, great camera--have the feeling I'm still only scratching the surface of what this thing is capable of. The Pros:1. Oustanding image quality, great colours, etc. Typically Nikon does err a little on the side of preserving detail, so you might find a little contrast/brightness adjustment in Photoshop to your taste. 2. Enough manual control if you want. Enough point and shoot in the Auto mode if you don't. 3. That swivel head gives great flexibility. 4. Best shot selection gives some really interesting flexibility with regard to avail. light photography (OK, so I know I really should use a tripod). The Not-so-good:1. The flash is disappointing. Terribly easy to red-eye anything biological :) Get the bracket and an add-on flash if you have to shoot flash. To be fair, tough for _any_ camera with the flash/lens this close together to not have the same problem (red eye reduc. or not).2. The pre-exposure focus lock does not 'feel' as definite (when you partially depress the exposure button) as on Nikon's 35mm SLRs. The nice, nice thing about the 990 is that the area of focus is artificially sharpened in the LCD viewfinder. _Very_ tough to check focus in 950 LCD viewfinder until _after_ you take the pic and magnify in the LCD. 3. Definitely less than great for fast moving action. Digitals in general are not the greatest for moving action. For long-time 35mm users, this is probably the hardest thing to get used to. By the time, you add in the focusing time, save to CF card, etc., there is a definite delay between pulling the trigger & getting the shot, as well as a significant delay between shots (flash use makes it worse). Some of this can be negated by swithing to Manual and presetting a focus distance, and so on, but it's an adjustment. Recommendations:1. Get three sets of NiMH rechargeable AA batteries--this thing eats batteries for breakfast.  2. Get a bigger CF memory card, at least 48MB.  3. Get a USB/PC card reader for the CF card--the serial connection is _painfully_ slow.  4. Download the .PDF file from Nikon's site which goes into a little more detail what the controls do.  5. Get this book! :)...  Would I get this again? YES, but I would probably spring the extra bucks for a Coolpix 990 for:1. Focus area sharpening 2. Selectable autofocus area 3. USB 4. QuickTime capture Less so for the 3.3 megapixel.","Date":"January 18, 2001"}

I currently sell items [online], and I've been using a HP C200 Digital Camera for the past year to take pictures of items that I was selling.  It got the job done, but when it came to detailed shots and close ups, it just didn't cut it.  I just received my Nikon Coolpix 950 and it's amazing.  Excellent detail at 1600x1200 resolution.  The close up shots (Macro Shots) are amazing.  I'm extremely satisfied with this camera.  If your a near power seller eBayer like myself, and you have the money, invest it into this camera.  It's really worth it.  I did my homework, and this camera gets you the best bang for your buck.  The CP800 and CP880 are good, but they are slightly worse than this model, and they require non-AA batteries, which are very expensive (so are the rechargeable ones and the charger).  The Coolpix 990 is slightly better than this model (it takes slightly better pictures and it boasts a higher resolution), but if you don't have the money, this model is worth it.  The Coolpix 950 and the Coolpix 990 are the best two digital camera's that you can buy for under [$].  If you want to go up another level, you need to be ready to shovel out over $3000.00 for camera's like the Nikon D1.  For accessories, get a USB CompactFlash Card reader, an A/C Adaptor, and two sets of rechargeable batteries.  I recommend a tripod as well, a small one especially for Macro shots.

It's great for taking pictures of yourself with friends without getting someone else to take it for you: just swing the lens around and hold out your arm and you could see yourself in the LCD screen.Some must-have accesories for this camera:1. Two sets of rechargable batteries and charger.  This camera uses a lot of juice.2. A wide angle lens.  Makes it easier to take photos of yourself.3. At least a 32meg flash card.

Ilike the 900 better but it has some of the same weaknesses. My peeves first;1. It powers up a full telephoto. I'd rather it stayed at wide angle. For Indoor shots, I'm constantly zooming out after power up to get a full width shot. This is a pain, especially given peeve #2.2. The flash performs well at wide angle but significantly underexposes when the lens is zoomed to telephoto. This is true regardless of distance. An object 15 feet away will be nicely exposed at wide angle but underexposed if you zoom to telephoto. Now my likes:1. Great image quality and good color fidelity2. The swivel head is increadibly useful. Hold the camera over your head when in a crowd and you can take great pictures without heads in the way. Hold it a waist level and you can handhold low light shots very easily. In both cases you can swivel the head so you can see the screen easily.3. Great low light performance. Tripod mounted it takes great star shots at 8 second shutter speed and can capture down to 6 magnitude stars.... just as good as the human eye.4. Magnesium body is better than plastic.

I wanted at least 2.1 megapixels and could have gotten other brand 3.3 cameras for the list price of the 950, but the features of this camera are what sold me.  The additional lens and flash options make this a photographers dream.  The point and click options make my non-photographer wife very happy. The Good: 1. Picture quality excellent! 2. Exposure and composition excellent! 3. Very easy to use 4. Lots of picture (size) options 10 different picture formats for storage purposes 5. Battery Life not all that bad if you do not use the LCD screen as your viewfinder The Bad: 1. Nikon photo software is kinda crappy (I now use Adobe Photoshop) 2. The serial connection is really slow...I bought a (lexar 8x) 32 meg memory card and a usb card reader for $50 bucks 3. The 8 meg card is kinda small if you want high res shots 4. No lens cover (so I bought a UV filter lens cover) to protect the expensive Nikon lens $5. Overall, I am extemely please with this camera....the price was too good to pass-up...I used a $50 dollar off online coupon from Amazon which brought the price down to $706 and then Nikon had a $150 dollar rebate on the Coolpix 950.

The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically. The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create \"red eye\" a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.)

I have never had a digital camera before  and there is so much that I can do it. I bought it as a gift for my wife  and she uses it for auctions on EBay.  It is easy to learn how to use.  It  does provide some documentation in hardback form unlike someother models.  I would recomend you to buy a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries and  it wouldnot hurt to buy at minimum, a 16 megabyte memory card.  The 8  megabyte card is fine for use around the house, but for example a vacation,  a 16 megabyte allows more flexiblity.  I gave it four stars because the  within 2 hours of receiving it, my wife was taking pictues and putting  those items up for auction.  I like this product and have recommended it to  friends.","Date":"September 10, 2000"}

I've taken hundreds of pictures with it so far and like its sleek design that makes it easy to whip out of the case to shoot pictures on the fly.

When I'm out with on a hiking trip with my camera and I need to find out some information...all I have to do is pop the CD into my computer, set up my solar battery array and run the CD...right? Someone at Nikon wasn't thinking about the customer. I'm also thinking about getting a flash memory card reader for fast downloading to my computer.

My wife did well in point and shoot with only 15  seconds of training.  I solved the problem that the wide angle zoom  position is not wide enough by buying the wide angle attachment, the  telephoto position is not long enough by buying the teledoubler.  You also  need a 40 mb flash memory card to hold a lot of shots.  An A/C adapter with  a long cord for indoor power works well and a rechargeable battery pack for  out door shooting expeditions is manditory.  SanDisk makes a great  flashcard reader so you can import your pictures through the parallel port  at port speed, MS's Photodraw is sufficient for snap shooting processing  and Adobe PhotoShop for heavey duty photo publication.

I did quite a lot of research prior to the purchase and it paid off, this is a great camera.  The other reviews cover all the pros and cons quite well so I'll put a different spin with my problems.  No problems with the camera or performance, the camera does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Most folks problems seem to be mismatched expectations or not understanding the technology.  My issues, and I can't seem to find help anywhere, so if anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it:1. Learning the real differences between all the combinations of Size and Quality.  I purchased Corel Photo-Paint 9  Digital Camera Edition for not to much $$$ and like it a lot but the size, resolution, compression, quality, etc. choices just blow me away.  I have found a lot of people with digital cameras but who really don't understand this part of the technology and Nikon's manuals and reference guides do not really help the digital novice.  I learned my photography over 30 years ago before automatic cameras of any kind existed and I still struggle with understanding the digital formats. I have 2 books on order from Amazon that I hope will educate me.2. Nikon external flashes are too expensive.  Has anyone found a third-party flash that works well with this camera?All in all a wonderful camera and Amazon has the best prices and service.  E-mail me at info@mainelywood.com if you have questions or info I could use.  I added rechargeable batteries, the filters, a  card reader, and a 96 mb CompactFlash card from SanDisk (called Nikon, manual says only up to 64mb but Nikon has since tested Lexar and SanDisk of larger capacities and approves them).

We even did some exhibitions of our work. Digital consumer cameras like the Coolpix are still not up to their  originals. But you have also to note that doing all the work in the  darkroom is time consuming and difficult. Getting pictures from the lab is  either disappointing or very expensive and you lose control over the  process. Using the Collpix 950 and some Epson printer (eg. Stylus 900) is a  very good compromize. Be aware that the display is nearly of no use at sun  lite conditions and dealing with contrast is difficult as ever. But  otherwise it is fun using the Coolpix 950 and some pictures are really  good. Resolution is indead very good. For the not overly ambitious (but  still quality oriented) enthusiast this camera is a very good choice  although there will be some better one in 6 months.

Cheap, it provided a 640x480 introduction to the fun you can have with a computer camera.  I love the immediate feedback you get when you download the  pictures to your computer and see them pop up!  I shoot many, many more  pictures now that I have a digital camera.If my old Fuji was a nifty PT  Boat, then my Nikon Coolpix 950 is an aircraft carrier.  The high 1600x1200  resolution mode is stunning to view on my PC.  I find myself wondering if  my HP color printer is now the weak link in producing the best quality  shots.I find I don't use the middle 1024x768 resolution at all.  I  either go 640x480 for pictures to email my friends, or 1600x1200 for ones  to keep and print.I haven't discarded my film camera yet, but I'm taking  far fewer film pictures.  This camera is amazing techology.  Even with  better CCD sensors in the future, I don't see this camera being dated soon.  Its high-res picture quality is amazing.

{"Title":"Workhorse Digital Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RIZL1S1E8WCJL","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my Coolpix 950 for 9 months now and I have been very pleased with the camera. There are a few annoyances about the camera: 1. The menu interface can sometimes be a bit odd, but once you figure out its logic, it works fine. 2. The 8 MB card that it comes with is too small if you plan to shoot in 1600x1200 resolutions. 3. If you mount the camera on a tripod, the card reader and battery compartment are not accessible, forcing you to take the camera off the mount to change cards or batteries. 4. The included manual is missing the last half of the text, although everything is in the PDF manual on the included CD.Those things aside, I really love this camera. It produces very good results and gives me the right amount of control when I need it. The wide-angle and telephoto lenses are great since they attach directly, without having to use a converter or step-down ring. If you want to shoot panorama images for QuickTime VR, this camera with the wide-angle lens works beautifully in conjunction with the Kaidan KIWI 900/950 tripod head. ... Long exposure shots are simple to do as well as other experimentation. It also has a B&W mode which actually produces very nice results, often overlooked in digital cameras. Nikon even makes a set of four filters specifically for the Coolpix cameras which are well worth it from a creative standpoint.The newer Coolpix 990 uses the same optics but with a larger CCD element. But if you are on a limited budget but you want a \"pro-sumer\" digital camera, you can get a 950 with a couple of lenses and an extra memory card ... fairly easily. If you just want the camera, plan on getting either a 32 or 64 MB card (Lexar or SanDisk) right from the start and keep the 8MB card handy in case you run out of space and need a few more shots.Almost a year after first searching for a digital camera, I would still buy either the 950 or 990 in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.","Date":"April 2, 2001"}

Nikon's chief battery door designer was apparently sick that day, and the janitor obviously submitted the design they used.  Eventually, even if you're careful, the chintzy little lightweight plastic slots on the camera body that the battery door tabs lock into, will break, and your otherwise finely made and great performing camera will need a generous strip of ducttape to hold the door closed - this makes the necessity of using the highest capacity NiMH battery you can find all that more important.  I'm drawing up plans to fabricate some small metal tabs to embed into the camera body to replace the crappy broken plastic, but haven't yet gotten happy with the Dremel tool to do the work.Bottom line:  Be Careful when you open the battery door - press it down against the camera body before you slide it to the unlocked or open position, and you can delay the inevitable plastic tab failure that will ruin an otherwise outstanding camera.","Date":"September 25, 2005"}

I called Nikon tech support and they walked me through a couple of things to try but nothing worked.  I found the tech support people to be undertrained and I knew more about the camera than some of them (pretty bad considering you drill down to the specific \"Coolpix 950 support\" through the automated phone menu).

I have read many reviews and never heard of this problem!  I called Viking and they had no knowledge of any incompatability with the 950.

The only real gripes I have are the limitations in the size of the Compact Flash it uses, and the fact that after a time, the battery compartment won't stay closed.  Otherwise, I've taken some fantastic pictures with this camera!  In fact, I'd have to say it does better than some of the newer Nikon Coolpix cameras (like the L18, which I also have).  I've found newer models to have focus and flash issues, as well as severe shutter lag.  This may not be comparable in resolution, but it's quite enough for most uses.

It was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer. She had outgrown it and was tired of me complaining that I saw this or that and wished at the time I had a better camera than my phone.If you have never used one of these before it will take a little getting used to. The camera pivots in half (which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens. The whole thing rotates freely 360 degrees, with snap-lock settings at each 180, so you can watch yourself \"taking a picture of you\" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder. The flash is a bit annoying, as it automatically fires in even remotely low-light circumstances. A simple press of a button disables the flash, but then you have a longer exposure time (about one full second) which means that you have to keep your hands really, really still. Just for fun, try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes.This camera is really at its best during the day. It should win an award for being the official picnic (or even beach) camera. It really is point and shoot, but it has an easy to learn and use zoom, auto/manual flash, and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery. The live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery, but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at. My guesstimate is something like 3-5 frames-per-second of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture.The short version: It is self-contained, easy to load and swap the memory card. It takes high resolution photos, and is so easy to use (and durable) that a 5 year-old could handle it (carefully). Stock up on extra AA batteries though. It eats through 4 of them in a few days of use.Hope this helps","Date":"September 14, 2008"}

{"Title":"A GREAT Camera For Professionals","Author":"David M. Gallagher","ReviewID":"RBN865XWGUSOT","Overall":"good","Content":"Wow, what a difference.  I currently sell items on eBay, and I've been using a HP C200 Digital Camera for the past year to take pictures of items that I was selling.  It got the job done, but when it came to detailed shots and close ups, it just didn't cut it.  I just received my Nikon Coolpix 950 and it's amazing.  Excellent detail at 1600x1200 resolution.  The close up shots (Macro Shots) are amazing.  I'm extremely satisfied with this camera.  If your a near power seller eBayer like myself, and you have the money, invest it into this camera.  It's really worth it.  I did my homework, and this camera gets you the best bang for your buck.  The CP800 and CP880 are good, but they are slightly worse than this model, and they require non-AA batteries, which are very expensive (so are the rechargeable ones and the charger).  The Coolpix 990 is slightly better than this model (it takes slightly better pictures and it boasts a higher resolution), but if you don't have the money, this model is worth it.  The Coolpix 950 and the Coolpix 990 are the best two digital camera's that you can buy for under $1000.00.  If you want to go up another level, you need to be ready to shovel out over $3000.00 for camera's like the Nikon D1.  For accessories, get a USB CompactFlash Card reader, an A/C Adaptor, and two sets of rechargeable batteries.  I recommend a tripod as well, a small one especially for Macro shots.  Overall, this is a very good camera.  The Coolpix 990 has better resolution, better picture quality, and its design is better, but if you don't have the extra money, the Coolpix 950 is simply the best you can get.","Date":"January 12, 2001"}

Not only did they jam so many features into this little digital wonder, including video, but the controls used to select all of them are downright confusing and VERY not intuitive. The optical 3x zoom is nothing special, the standard lens is not wide-angle enough and the resulting photos are no better than some of its cheaper rivals. My suggestion? Purchase the CP800 if you can, its not jammed with as many high-megapixels, but its convenience, fast operability and consistent results play a huge role!

{"Title":"Good camera for the price","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2PCJ9ERSE32RW","Overall":"good","Content":"The day after I bought the DX-10 I called Fuji and found it was discontinued. How's that for instant obsolescence? I bought the DX-10, my  first digital camera, as a learning tool and it is excellent for that. I  was surprised at the quality of the images yet the chintzy construction of  the camera body, an ugly. 7oz. plastic box. The DX-10 feels like an empty  matchbox compared to a loaded F4, F3 or any lighter Nikon. After I bought  the camera I found it eats batteries, so I bought an Olympus charger and  four nickel-metal hydride batteries. More money. Also, I bought a special  AC adapter, both items a must unless you own a battery factory.  Photographers say \"There are no photographers at Nikon,\" because  even with a new Nikon, you seem to start out with your own modifications.  This DX-10 was like that. I took it out of the box and rigged a neckstrap  to replace the silly wrist cord that holds the DX-10 literally by a thread.  The owner's manual warns not to scratch the lens or rear LCD screen, yet  neither has any kind of protective cap. And a protective carrying case,  like the charger and AC adapter is another extra expense. Speaking of  extras, buy an extra Smart Media card to boost the 2MB card that comes with  the camera. That will only record six images of the highest resolution. I  bought a 16MB card, which bumps that number up to 54. Oh yes, the floppy  disk adapter that let's you download the images from camera to computer?  That's another expense. The DX-10 comes with a cable but it didn't fit my  aging computer. To be fair, all these extra costs are no different from my  experience with 35mm photography. The price of the camera is just the  beginning, just the tip of the beginning. If you've never owned a digital  camera, the DX-10 is a good learning tool. I've learned a lot -- much of it  what to look for next time I buy digital camera.","Date":"October 26, 1999"}

{"Title":"I wish they still made them like this.","Author":"\"sunmech\"","ReviewID":"R100FVVX2UHUIS","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife two years ago (1999) and I think she took maybe a dozen pictures with it. The rest of the time I must have put it through about 2,000 pictures, and built several personal websites with it. Originally it was the price that did it ... from Amazon, and back then, it was the only ... digital camera with an LCD screen. It's also small enough to fit in your pocket easily. You can never go wrong with AA batteries, they're always available in a pinch. ALL digicams suck up batteries, my advice is invest in some rechargeables. The LCD updates extremely fast, although the photo itself is on about a 2-second lag from the moment you actually press the shutter button. But at least the photo stays on the LCD until you decide whether to save it or erase it. (which the Toshiba I own doesn't.)The menu is completely intuitive, the controls are simple and iconic, the only thing you can really do wrong is leave the Macro switch on by mistake, and you only discover that when you view them fullsize and discover they're out of focus. Recycle time between pictures is comparatively slow (several long painful seconds) to what's currently out there as well. (end of 2001) Don't get this camera for action shots, because you'll miss them.a 16M SmartMedia card will get you about 50 images in the highest resolution.For webpages, once you shrink the images to fit on a webpage, they're all the same. The difference is negligible.But if you're going to blow them up to print them, it might be a problem in anything bigger than 8x10. 1.6x digital zoom, no focus, but at least those are two things less to worry about. The photos are always in focus anyway.Color-correction modes are a little off color-wise, but that's always been fixable with basic imaging software. (even that's always dependable on your platform, for instance, dark greens seem to register as black on PCs, and vivid green on MACs.)After awhile, dust started to accumulate under the protective plastic lens cover, and the photos became blurry. There was no way to reach it by disassembling the camera to clean it, so I broke the cover off completely. Problem solved. Even though the resolution is under 1M-pixel, photos consistently come out sharp and high quality.This model comes with a video-out jack. Subsequent models such as the MX-1200 don't have it. If you like watching the photos back on your TV or other video source, then get this model.The serial cord to upload them to your computer is horribly slow. (I'm talking about 20+ minutes to load. Seriously.)Get either a USB card reader, ...or a floppy adapter instead and save yourself about 19 minutes of finger-tapping.I just upgraded to a Toshiba PDR-M70, because I need more flexibility, things such as a flash-sync port for my studio flash equipment, and the ability to attach filters. But I wish it had the simplicity menu-wise of the DX-10.","Date":"November 18, 2001"}

An important feature that is too often overlooked is the fact that it is aluminum clad, so dropping it won't easily result in the heartache of a broken camera that costs hundreds to be replaced immediately or a costly repair that will deprive the owner of its use for an extended period.It's outdoor shots are excellent; its 2.5X OPTICAL zoom is the largest presently available in the Canon Elph-based repertoire of digicams; its 1.3 Megapixel resolution gives 35mm equivalent 4\"x6\" prints on either H-P or Epson photo printers.The drawbacks often reported with shots taken using the internal flash are not critical; although the power of the flash is effectively limited to a range of within 10 feet, the A-50 has multiple modes that deal well with red eye reduction, fill flash, or no flash at all, to the extent of being the virtual match for any digicam list priced under \"$1,000\". Its controls are easy to master; its playback mode extends to a \"slide show\" in the LCD (which is larger than the average digicam's at 2 full inches diagonal) or on TV. The camera DOES eat batteries, so TWO batteries and the optional power pack (now readily available for under $80 with one battery, second battery about $25) is a MUST. If you upgrade to higher resolution Canon \"Elph-based\" digicams, you can use this battery and charger. These lithium batteries will last for up to 100 shots using the LCD as a preview and thus are good for a full day of shooting. The second battery permits full operation while the first battery is charging.The A-50 will handle most sizes (under 200 MB) of Compact Flash Type I, and puts 161 photos on a 48 MB card. That's enough for a week's worth of vacation shots. (...)It is the BEST optical zoom 1.3 Megapixel camera on the market for ease of use, portability and versatility. Another nice feature, not found in all cameras, is a \"raw mode\" that permits uncompressed photos. Its JPEG compression on \"best mode\" does little to adversely affect the photographs, and there are a host of other features that will appeal to the more advanced photographers.All in all, the A-50 was well designed and a good value for the money. Of course, at this time, with the advent of 3.3 Megapixel cameras, and the S-100 Digital Elph at 2.1 Megapixel with a 2X optical zoom, the A-50, at 1.3MP and its serial interface can be considered obsolete, but, at its current price, it's my choice as a gift for my preteen daughter. It's just right without spending more than necessary for someone who can use the zoom lens effectively, adapt the camera to slide shows and does not need to print anything larger than 5\" X 7\" photos on a color inkjet.......and if she drops this sturdy little aluminum 'tank' of a camera, I won't be out a fortune for replacement or repair!","Date":"December 3, 2001"}

I've been doing photography for years, but am not a professional. I have had my  Mavica 83 for just one month, but the real thrill was taking it out onto  the beach, two hours after bringing it home, and easily taking my first 2  floppies full of pictures! The menu is easily understandable, and the  quality of the pictures I've taken, is excellent. The 6x digital zoom is  also excellent for most shots. I love being able to copy the contents of  one full disk onto another (to share) right in the camera's 4x drive. I'd  heard negative reviews, concerning it only having the LCD, but with a bit  of practice, this becomes second nature. All LCD's have some problems with  & in the sun, but if you know how to set up your shot, this isn't a  problem. The flash is very stark/bright in & on your photo. It's so  much fun and very easy sending pictures by email! I think everyone in my  family will probably be buying a digital for Christmas! I went to several  stores, to pick up, handle and move around with the menu's, of all the  camera's I could find. I recommend you do this too, if you're going to buy  one. Some camera's just don't feel right in your hands. The controls on  this camera are conveniently placed. I have a couple \"newspaper\"  writing friends, and they tell me, they use Mavica 83's from the office  too. That seemed good enough for me! The only thing I am not satisfied  with, is the battery life. Yes, I'm turning off my LCD too, in hopes of  extending it, but, the battery doesn't have the stated minutes life. The  macro is also excellent, and can really catch some interesting views. There  are cheaper cameras, and getting more powerful by the week, but for now, I  highly recommend the Mavica 83. Being able to use floppies as film, is  great, as you can share these with anyone, and it's the cheapest way to go.  My only wish is that they had included a cap / protective cover, for the  LCD.","Date":"November 26, 1999"}

If you need to print out 8X10 photorealistic  prints, buy a 2 megapixel camera; for everything short of this, the Mavica  83 is a superb camera. Unlike other reviewers, I find that this camera does  a respectable job in low-light situations.One drawback is the optical  zoom, which is \"only\" 3X. Sony's high-quality teleconverter  (~$50) will increase this to 6X. Its use of 1.4mb floppy disk storage  hasn't been a drawback for me: the 4X floppy drive is quick, it is easy to  change floppies, and one floppy holds a respectable number of images  (around 8 in 1024X768 fine mode, around 20 in 640X480 fine mode).The  brief MPEG movies are great fun, and an easy way to create video e-mail or  to add streaming video web sites.For the price, I'd prefer this  high-quality .8 megapixel camera to the \"bargain\" 2 megapixel  cameras, which may have inferior optics.My conclusion: Don't believe the  hype about the \"need\" for 2 megapixel cameras. For e-mail, web,  and smaller prints, the Mavica 83 occupies a great \"sweet spot:\"  it combines many higher-end features with superior ease-of-use,  convenience, and optics.","Date":"January 3, 2000"}
{"Title":"Digital Camera for Dummies!","Author":"hrd2pls \"hrd2pls\"","ReviewID":"R14FXJ62XTR4OO","Overall":"good","Content":"I can't help but rave about Sony Mavica FD-83's versatility!  It has auto/manual focus, digital zoom, four different picture effects including black & white, 2 image quality modes, and it can also record a short  video with voice.  You'd wonder if you have to be a hi-tech guru to operate  a camera loaded with features.  Not so!  This camera is soooo easy to use  that I didn't even have to read the manual to make it work the first time I  got it.  I just popped in a floppy disk, took pictures, took the floppy out  and into my computer and presto! QUALITY pictures right before your eyes!  Of course, after finally reading the manual, I found out about the other  wonderful features of FD-83.  My favorite is the \"E-mail\" setting  which automatically makes a copy of the pictures you take in a much smaller  file size and therefore,  cuts the upload and download times of the  pictures you send through email.  No more playing around with your pictures  to reduce the file size, it's all done for you!  There's more to this  camera than I have space to write about them for.  Read the other reviews.  I highly recommend the Sony Mavica FD-83 ... IT IS WORTH IT!","Date":"December 10, 1999"}

This is it, while resolution is not as good as other camaras, if you need it for web applications its good enough. One very good feature, at least for me,  is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as  close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close  distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is  the fact that it stores in floppy disks. This is a convenient storage media  and while the storage capacity is not big, they are so cheap you can buy as  many as you need.

I can reel off  the images I need, edit them, and store them for future reference.The  resolution, while some say is lower quality, seems pretty great as well.  I  can actually take digital photos of paintings or prints and get immediate  good prints to send to perspective clients or even print out on a good  photorealistic printer for mini art prints (but be sure it's on good paper  and with good ink).

If you want web or computer images, it is an excellent camera.  If you want professional prints, get a 35mm film camera.  I have all but replaced my  35mm for almost all my photo uses.  Once you learn the quirks of exposure  settings, you can get excellent quality images in a wide range of lighting  conditions - in spite of what others have said.  Don't rely too much on the  supplied manual - you have to experiment - but since you're not 'wasting  film', you can afford to.  I find the floppy storage to be very convenient.  The ONLY drawback I find is the inability to stop fast action without  blurred images.","Date":"January 25, 2000"}

After looking at cameras from other vendors and trying cameras that our other departments were using our group decided upon the Mavica mainly because of the floppy drive. Overall, we have been delighted with  the camera except for the fact that it is limited to daytime usage. In dim  light conditions one has to be almost on top of the subject or the result  is too dark. In addition, we found that the LCD screen was easily scratched  by shirt buttons when the camera was carried on the strap around the neck.  Also in the year of ownership we have had a floppy drive failure.  Be aware  that free labor charges end after 90 days and the normal charge is $ for  repair. The parts are free within the first year of ownership. In  conclusion, for daylight outdoor scenes or indoor scenes with the right  lighting conditions this is a good camera. And for multiple users the  floppy drive is efficient.","Date":"December 22, 1999"}

{"Title":"It's very good","Author":"ggjn@sprynet.com","ReviewID":"R23UYF2EBW0JFT","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the FD-83 after having borrowed my father's FD-81 off and on for several months.  Unfortunately, my FD-83 had a technical problem (autofocus always mis-focused) which required me to return it for repairs  under warranty. I live in the Boston area and so there is a Sony repair  station nearby.  They made good on the warranty and since that time it has  serviced us well.The picture resolution is slightly less than you'll  find on other digital cameras **BUT** the convenience of diskettes (to me)  far outweighs any resolution or storage issues.  Someone mentioned that  diskettes are expensive.  You can purchase a 100-pack at any office supply  house for around $20, so I really don't consider 20 cents per diskette as  being costly.If you use the standard resolution, which I find myself  doing most of the time, I get around 20 pics on a floppy.  What I have  found as an unexpected convenient bonus is the copy feature -- you can make  multiple copies of photos or photo-diskettes on the spot.  This is handy  when you are on vacation or visiting people.  And, of course, 3.5 inch  diskettes are available anywhere.  When going on an outing I carry five or  six.  This enables me to snap 100 pics for around a buck, and this assumes  I never reuse the diskettes.  While the higher resolution pics and  *.mpg features are nice and probably were effective at convincing me to  purchase this,  I realize now I almost never use those features.  I also  refrain from using the digital zoom and stay within the 3:1 optical zoom  range.  If I had a longer optical zoom, I would use that, and Sony has made  inroads on that in their higher models.From using the older FD-81, I  also used MGI Photosuite as the software, which is what Sony used to  distribute with their cameras.  The FD-83 I have came with different  software (ArcSoft with Polaroid PhotoMax) that has more features but I find  myself preferring the MGI package more or Microsoft Photo Editor. I just  personally find those easier to use.All in all, do I recommend this?  YES.  I did see other cameras that took better pictures, but how much  clarity do you need on a 19-inch screen?  Or an 8 x 10 printed photo?  This  does the job adequately.  And the general ease of use, as well as having  diskette media convenience makes this worth using. If I really want  super-sharp pictures that I would display in a slide show on a 15 foot  screen - I can reach for my trusty Canon AE-1 35MM camera.  But for general  use, the FD-83 is my plaything now.","Date":"April 12, 2000"}

Megapixel mode (1216x912) will result in 4 to 7 images on a standard floppy disk depending upon the complexity of the image.  1024x768 mode results in 7 to 10 photos  on a disk.  640x480 mode results in 14 to 20+ photos on the disk.  The max  resolution stated on Amazon is not 1024x768 (that's an error that needs  correcting).  The camera takes very nice 5, 10, or 15 second MPG movies in  either 160x120 or 320x200 mode.  I've had this camera for three months now  and carry it with me everywhere, along with a box of disks.  At the minimum  I keep a fresh disk in the camera.  With a rechargable battery that I've  used full blast taking photos on 25+ disks for two hours, you can't beat  it.  Memory sticks are convenient as you won't have to unload and reload  your camera, but nothing beats being able to take the disk out of the  camera, hand it to someone, and be done with it.  They can pop that disk  into any PC or Mac and view the contents without going through any memory  stick download process at all.  What I do hope is that Sony picks up on the  SuperDisk 120-MB floppy technology and incorporates it into their next line  of cameras.  That should resolve any \"not enough space on a disk\"  issues.  But for now, it's fun and I'm very happy with my camera.","Date":"May 4, 2000"}

I was even able to get more \"film\" in Cartegena, Columbia.  Just ask for \"diskettes\".  The LCD display can be hard to see if bright sun is shining on it, but point and click and you can see the picture as it records on the disk in the shade of your body.  If you want to see the image for a longer time just slide the mode switch from \"Still\" to \"Play\" and see all the images taken so far.  Slide the switch to Movie and take MPG digital movie clips with sound.  These too can be reviewed with sound in just seconds after recording on disk.  The sound is as good as my 8 mm video camera.  At the highest resolution expect three \".MPG\" 5 second clips, at the lowest, six 5 second clips.  With the stills, you will record 10 \".JPG\" images at the highest and 23 at the lowest resolution per standard 1.4 MB floppy disk.  These numbers vary depending on program and zoom settings.A fun camera for amature photagraphy and recording your vacation.

I like the camera...I'm just really unhappy with the media it uses. When I said floppy disks were expensive, I  meant on a per-magabyte basis. For my example, I'll use the Iomega Clik!  disk (40 MB) A floppy disk usually costs about a dollar and a half (when  bought by itself). A Clik! disk costs $15 dollars by itself. You need to  buy 27 3 1/2 floppy disks to equal a Clik!. That's $25 more, thus making  the floppy disk less cost-efficient.  (To be fair, I'll counteract my own  case. I know people buy floppies in bulk, but you can do the same with the  Clik!'s, CompactFlashes, and SmartMedia cards. Also, there's the issue of  buying the $150 Clik! Drive, but after buying 6 disks, it pays for  itself.)This is another product that could ONLY sell in America, where  we put convienience over quality and [cost-]effeciency. This camera was  great a couple years ago, but now, as floppies are starting to die (but it  will still take a few years), the technology is getting stale. I know Kodak  and Olympus are selling some really great cameras from last year for  sub-$200 prices. Of course, for the person new to digital imaging AND  computers, this (overpriced) camera may be the way to go...if you've tries  d a competitor's effort and have hated it. REMEMBER: Digital Cameras are  a must ONLY for people who regularly need images on a computer. You can  always have a film developer put your 35mm film on disk, or scan your 35mm  pictures or negatives with a scanner.","Date":"May 6, 2000"}

The best feature is the floppy disk storage media.  You're out of town, no laptop mega-drive and out of storage?  Buy a $5 box of disks and shoot for another  month!I bought an extra battery for mine which is real handy when  traveling.  The battery life is real good - several hours of continuous  shooting and viewing, even with the lower life battery supplied with the  camera.  These batteries also interchange with Sony video cameras, so you  can get double duty out of them if you own a video camera also.I have  used the camera to take pictures to email to family & friends, Fox  & Friends, post on auction sites, send to publications and even just to  print out on photo paper.  I used the camera on a tripod to take pictures  of kids on Santa's lap this past Christmas, printing them on photo paper  with an ink jet printer - a terrific success!  The quality was not quite  35mm SLR, but it was a whole lot better and faster than a cheap 35mm.I  am now experimenting with the mpeg video mode for our local track team,  many events are completed in less than the 1 minute limit in extended mode.  We may post these to the students web sites eventually.All my old 52mm  lense accessories  fit this camera.  The filters, effects lenses & etc.  add to the creativity you can unleash with this camera.  The ability to  instantly check your work by viewing on the screen is impossible with 35mm.  Many years ago I considered becoming a professional photographer and back  then you had to do a test shot with a Polaroid to check lighting,  composition and so on.  I believe this camera will take the place of  Polaroids in all applications.  Don't throw out the old Nikon 35 yet  though, for true quality work, you still need film.This camera also has  a whole disk or single frame copy feature that is really nice if you want  to give copies of your pictures away in the field.  You can also delete  unwanted frames to free disk space in the camera.  The controls and menus  for all these functions are intuitive and straight forward to use.Exposure control is also easily accomplished with a series of  programable features.  The shutter speed, apeture, flash and white balance  can all be set manually if you don't want to use the automatic mode, which  really is adequate for most situations.  You will want to read the book  first, but once you have the basics down, it is just infinite  experimentation from there.  You can't make a mistake - just reset and try  again - you're not wasting expensive film!I would recommend getting a  wide angle accessory lense; if you are taking pictures of large subjects in  tight quarters, (no, I'm not talking about Santa Claus!), sometimes you  can't backup far enough.  An extra battery, as mentioned above, is also  essential if you plan to use it traveling or on all day assignments.","Date":"April 30, 2000"}

I can lend one out to an experienced emulsion photographer and, when necessary, teach him/her the essentials of how to use it in 5-6  minutes.  These flexible features make it perfect for my situation:  The  14:1 zoom means less cropping, and therefore higher resolution in the final  cropped photo; the swivel LCD means it's easy to shoot from a higher angle  (like over heads of a crowd or from a low angle, or even around a corner;  floppy-disk media means film is essentially unlimited, or limited only to  roughly 8x the number of disks I'm willing to carry, and they're cheap so  \"film cost\" is never a problem.  Finally, of course, in a  newspaper operation there are the digital camera advantages of immediate  availability, unlimited no-cost shooting because there are no one-time film  or processing costs.  As to resolution, the 1024x768 size means that a  landscape shot can be printed as wide as 12 inches in an 85-line screen  without apparent loss of resolution.  (But because this camera is so  oustanding, I've now purchased a third Mavica, the FD95, for its  resolution, which is 2.5x the FD91's.)  The cost equation on the FD91 is  outstanding, because although the purchase price is high, the advantage of  no film cost soon makes it the cheapest possible photo solution for anybody  who shoots a lot of pictures.","Date":"July 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"All in all, the BEST camera out there for the home user","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2EYUGZM8PE2S3","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is TOPS for home use.  The pros might find a few things lacking, such as the limited flash intensity and inability to add an external flash.  The ONLY other draw back I have found it the length of  time it takes to save a pic.  It takes approximately 3-4 seconds for the  pic to save, so rapid fire shooting is out.  But, with the floppy drive,  and ultimately endless storage capacity (how many disks can you carry?)  makes this a tolerable drawback.  It is not in the megal pixel range, but  in the 1024x768 fine mode, I have found that the resolution is very good.  NOTHING beats the zoom on this thing.  14x zoom!

(Amazing in the computer world) Others have cameras with more pixels, more storage, etc., but no one has  matched the lens. a 14x (38mm-510mm) optical zoom is unmatched. Combine  that with the floppy storage (no easier method for transporting to multiple  computers) and the multiple viewfinders (LCD screen and eyepiece) and you  have an unbeatable combination.  The resolution is more than acceptable for  anything but professional use (and even for professional use online) and I  bet hardly anyone uses anything other than JPEG mode anyway. A real winner!

Those features make it into a very high quality camera.  I bought this camera thinking that it was an  advantage that it uses 3.5\" disks instead of memory cards but I now  think I would rather it use memory cards just because it would hold more  pictures and I wouldn't have to carry around stacks of disks.  That's not  too big of a problem though because the quality of the pictures are  fantastic.  I use this camera all the time and would recommend it to others  that don't mind that it uses 3.5\" disks.

{"Title":"Kudos from a long-time 35mm SLR camera fan! 5 stars!","Author":"Alan R. Holyoak","ReviewID":"RZU64U8QZLKEO","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, a confession...I am not \"Joe-digital camera.\"  I don't get involved in discussions about how many mega-pixels a camera has, etc., but I know that I am sold on the Sony Mavica line in general, and on this camera in particular...here's my story...When my department found enough funds to purchase a digital camera I campaigned for a SONY Mavica. I had used one briefly, with nothing but success.  What a camera, easy to use, and good results, too!  We went the rounds about pixels, and the rest...but in the end the point that tipped the scales was that this camera has an option that other makers simply didn't offer, the ability to use standard 3.5\" floppies.The 3.5\" floppy option is perfect for us.  The camera is used by multiple people (including students), who work at their own computers.  That means that we could avoid having to track down the patch cords for downloading, hassles associated with multiple station use of software, and etc.  Whew!The camera has a 14x zoom capability that makes it easier to use the entire frame.  You can take photos at different resolutions, depending on the use and the number of images you want to put on each disc.  In addition to still images, this camera lets you make MPEG files.  They're fun, and they can be useful.As for ease of use...I was taking pictures in less than 5 minutes after I picked up this camera for the first time -- and this is the first digital camera I ever used!  When you take photos you have the option of using a viewfinder or a small LCD screen to frame your photo.  As a long-time 35mm SLR camera fan I the eyepiece a comforting option.  After a while I suppose I could get used to the LCD screen...it's a reasonable size, and in color.The camera's menu system is easy to use, you can even delete unwanted photos immediately.Be prepared for a camera that's a bit bigger than most digital cameras out there.  This camera is comparable in size and weight to many changeable lens 35mm cameras systems.  On the plus side, the design is ergonomic.  It feels good in your hand.  The grips are well designed, there is someplace for your hands and fingers to go.  I like that.Our department bought this camera at full price.  At the currently discounted price I'm toying with the idea of getting one of these for myself...but I better talk to the wife about that (hint -- that's always a good plan).To sum up, this is a great camera.  It's convenient, easy to use, and a great deal to boot! What more could anyone ask?  And this is a lot of camera for the money!  If you take a lot of photos, the money you save in developing will eventually pay for the camera!P.S.  I wonder how long it will be before my 35mm SLR is a collector's item?  Probably not too long with cameras like this one around.Happy snapping!Alan Holyoak, Department of Biology, Manchester College","Date":"January 20, 2001"}

This camera, is definitely worth the money that i paid, therefore it is without a doubt a hot buy here for its current price.The camera is truely state of the art, one of my many favorite features of this camera would have to be the usage of a 3.5 floppy disk. thats right folks, you simply insert a 3.5 floppy disk into the side of the camera, and vwoala! you snap pictures, when that is used up, insert another one. if the disk isnt formatted, the camera will format it for you. you then insert the disk into you hard drive (Computer drive, that is) and view your pictures.The picture quality is wonderful, its clean and crisp. I actually used this at my brothers highshool graduation, took the pictures home, and printed them out. The pictures came out fantastic. not only did i snap pictures, and delete the ones that i didnt like right from my camera, i recorded approx 30 seconds worth of video footage, which can be used with real player.This camera is one of my favorite electronic goodies around my house, and i have a lot of electronic goodies. The zoom on this camera is quite good, but it pales in comparison to the 1.4X zoom lens that i bought for this camera, man, now that thing is sweet. can we say telescope?!This camera is definitely worth the mula. whether youre looking for a camera for recreational use (like me), or if youre going to use it as a professional photographer (like my dad's friend, who introduced it to us) this camera will satisfy your needs, and then some.It's a fun little gadget, its easy to use, and you'll love it.

{"Title":"Sony Mavica FD-91 Digital Camera- Thumbs Up For MAC or PC","Author":"Uncle_Audio","ReviewID":"R1KCX7T0UUO4SV","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall I've been super impressed with the results from this camera. It makes use of an HTML index of all photos or video recorded on a floppy diskette. The floppy disk as storage is one of the primary attractions in terms of getting digital images to the computer. It is also its greatest weakness. In the RAW image format (TIFF), the Mavica can store (1) image on a diskette. With a \"fine\" setting you will likely get storage of 20-22 JPEG compressed images on a single 1.4 MB diskette. Being a MAC and PC user I was very concerned about the PC format required for the floppy diskettes. But, I know most modern Power MAC's can format or read a diskette from a PC. The format of the photos (JPEG) is universal across most all platforms. The digital video output is limited to 60 seconds at the most modest resolution setting (approx 180 X 240 pixels.) Video output can be edited or viewed by Quicktime Pro for MAC or any MPEG-2-able video editor on the PC. The other setting for still photos will give the photographer a wide range of resolution choices for uses like e-mail or still photos with short accompanying sound tracks (also in MPEG-2.) As a professional photographer, I've been very happy with the photo-quality output from a variety of color printers (Apple and Epson). There are distinct limitations due to the .8 megapixel resolution, which really doesn't allow for much of an enlargement over 8\" X 10\". On top of that, your original image needs to be exposed correctly and should not require a lot of digital filtration or cleanup once it reaches the computer. The best original  yields the best results. On the whole, I've found the results to be a little below my desire for better output and higher resolution. This camera has maintained an excellent price resale level as a used camera, and the optical 14X zoom is one of the best around with top notch optical quality. The next model up with a Zeiss lens sells for several hundred dollars more and may be justified with Zeiss-quality optics and the option for Sony memory for storage in addition to the floppy disk. This camera does require a little setup to use, it is not a point and shoot camera. There's a white color balance option based on evaluating the hue of the incoming light through the white translucent lens cap- don't lose the lens cap! Overall this is one of the best digital cameras I've used in terms of color rendering. Perhaps one of its' strongest features is the camera's ability to achieve very life-like color and it does so without much muss and fuss. The Mavica FD-91 handles close-ups extremely well, even with the built-in flash. I found it lacking only in it's inability to trip an external flash unit with a hot shoe or synch plug. You have to rely on the built-in flash as the main light source and this becomes a real drain on the battery. By the way, purchase a couple of optional Lithium batteries; the NP-F550 is Sony's longest charged battery for this model to date. I also recommend getting a camera case for this model as a plastic, Kevlar reinforced body is no substitute for a bomb-proof metal body at half the weight. Without breaking the bank, originally this would have been considered as one of the nicer buy-ins of digital image creation technology. But, according to current standards (2004), it is considered expensive and lacking in the higher resolution that current cameras 1/5th of the price now incorporate. Currently, I could only recommend it for purchase as a used camera, provided you could get it for about a third of the orginal price when sold new.","Date":"February 20, 2000"}

It did everything a camera of it's day could do and more. And I still use it in my small business today. Image size is tiny today at less than a megapixel; but for general purpose documentation, which I do, it's fine. The monster zoom lens never ceases to amaze me. In the entire 10 years there have been NO camera issues whatsoever. it's been perfect and has been in use at least weekly the whole time. I have replaced the battery several times; count on it to last a couple of years with regular use. The only drawback for me is having to constanty swap floppy disks since in its max jpeg resolution, it only holds about 5-10 shots per disk, depending on image complexity. And of course, it's a pain to transfer files to a PC. You have a choice of using the LCD panel or the viewfinder, which is really handy in sunny locations. I looked at replacing it recently, but soon realized that except for image size and storage, it would cost at least $250 to replace it. So, I'm keeping it for now.","Date":"April 2, 2010"}

{"Title":"Excellent camera - durable - great zoom","Author":"\"joefunsmith\"","ReviewID":"RJ79S003D5O6J","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera has many unique features that make it perfect for the right person.  First, it doesn't store pictures on memory cards like most cameras, it stores on floppies.  This means you probably already have the \"memory.\"  When I first purchased this camera, that was great because 16 MB memory cards were expensive and if you were taking a lot of pictures, it could add up real quick.  Now, 128 MB memory cards are cheap and will hold 100x the pictures a floppy will hold.  That said, the picture quality is great for this class, and the zoom will astound you.  A friend has this same camera and uses some passive flash units with it to create off-center flash lighting.  The built-in flash is only good for a narrow distance range of about 10 ft.  Much closer and it floods the subject, much further and it doesn't reach, but this is easily overcome, plus, you don't need a flash with this camera in many situations where a conventional camera would need one.  The flippable lcd display will flip so it shows to the front and automatically flips the image so you can see the framed image when doing self-portraits.  Includes auto or manual focus and f-stop modes.  It also takes very short movies with sound. Optional optical viewfinder.

Garvey \"Shastalore\"","ReviewID":"RMZTEG5W9HAZQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I picked up this 33-ounce dinosaur-of-a-camera at a yard sale, for $ 5.00, simply because I was intrigued with its well thought-out design and many clever features.There are two major points I'd like to make, before delving into the details of this camera:If you're going to seriously use this camera, be sure to purchase a Sony (or an equal capacity clone) NP-F550 InfoLITHIUM battery, 7.2V, 18.5Wh = 2500mAh, Li-ion.Maximalpower SON NP-F550 Battery for SONY InfoLithium L NP-F330 NP-F550 NP-F570 CCD-SC55 CCD-TR516 CCD-TR716 CCD-TR818 CCD-TR910 CCD-TR917 2500mah fully decoded w/3yr warrantyThis will last all weekend, going through multiple 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskettes, and still show no signs of discharging.Only batteries with the internal \"InfoLITHIUM\" microchip will work in the MVC-FD91. Believe me, I've tried. I removed the vertical plastic rib inside the battery compartment and inserted a generic 7.2V Lithium-ion battery, but an error message appeared on the display and the camera promptly shut down.And the standard Sony NP-F330 (7.2V, 5.0Wh = 676mAh, Li-ion) InfoLITHIUM battery will only get you through one 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskette  -and that's provided you don't decide to erase any photos in the process.The next important point is that the Sony MSAC-FD2 Memory Stick Floppy Disk Adapter  -or any brand of floppy disk adapter, will not work with the MVC-FD91. You're confined to basic 1.44MB 3.5-inch, 2HD, DOS formatted diskettes on this camera. I know, the Sony MSAC-FD2 was a Memory Stick Floppy Disk Adapter that was designed to be compatible with many of the Sony Mavica series cameras with internal 3.5-inch diskette drives. But the MVC-FD91, unfortunately, was not one of them. The Sony Mavica series cameras, that did work with the floppy disk adapter, had a small switch inside to detect the adapter and align the head. So attempting to use any flash memory floppy disk adapter, in the Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD91 camera, will only generate a disk error message on the display. Anyway, even those Sony Mavica cameras that were designed to use a flash memory floppy disk adapter: Its two CR2016 internal batteries entered discharge mode everytime the floppy disk adapter was inside a 3.5-inch disk drive, in the Mavica series camera or in the computer. Not exactly an efficient design.For those who truly miss the days of the 35mm single lens reflex film camera, read on, as this one just might be the digital camera for certain limited applications. The shutter release triggers an unmistakable electronic sound that mimics the mechanical shutter release of vintage 35mm SLR film cameras. This camera was shrewdly designed to wean old school photographers from their 35mm SLR film cameras. With automatic/manual toggle on many features, this digital camera does give the skilled photographer considerable control of every shot.And those who wax nostalgic about their old 4x5 sheet-film view cameras will feel quite at home, using a heavy tripod, black cape, and frequent switching of the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskettes, although the lens is permanently at 90 degrees to the digital CCD image sensor, and the digital resolution is much less than 4x5 sheet film images. But I'm not really joking about the black cape, as it is still helpful for those shots in the field that require careful manual focusing. But I have since attached a \"eFilm DU2.5\"-M\" fold-out sunshade (see link posted below) to the 2.5\" TFT color LCD monitor, and while not as good as the black cape, it's more convenient, not as ridiculous, and greatly helps in direct sunlight. It also protects the 2.5\" LCD monitor from damage, when the camera is not in use.Delkin Devices DU2.5-M Universal Pop-Up Shade for 2.5-Inch LCD ScreensSporting a 2.5-inch TFT color LCD monitor that physically rotates 180 degrees, the camera functions quite well for flat-field copy shots, when mounted vertically, and pointed down at a copy board with side illumination. This camera also has a \"optical\" digital through-the-lens viewfinder, not unlike those of the single lens reflex 35mm film cameras of yore  -great for action shots in bright sunlight. The two viewing modes, both fully digital, are easily toggled back and forth as needed. There is also dioptic adjustment on the \"optical\" digital viewfinder for those who wear glasses.But, instead of using manual focus, I have found a way to be expedient in the field, by leaving the camera on \"Auto Focus\" mode, as well as \"Steady Shot\" image stabilization mode, and then on my laptop at home, opening up each photo in \"iPhoto Plus 4.0\"  -or any photo manipulation software, and electronically enhancing the sharpness by only one increment. \"IrfanView\" will also do this, and will even batch process the sharpness of all of the photos in one sweep, if needed. The photo resolution is not changed by this, but the image really \"pops out\" and appears clearer and sharper. I uploaded some of these \"sharpened\" photos, for you to judge, but you'll have to scroll down the web page to find them.As I usually shoot XGA 1024x768 jpeg photos, in fine mode. The 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette has the capacity for 6 photos per 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette, and is perfect for my requirements.VGA (640x480) jpeg photos, set on fine mode, provide a 13-photo limitation per 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette. Typical 640x480 fine-option jpegs can range from about 51KB to 147KB in size.Note: While capable of saving a bitmap photo, the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette only has the capacity for one such photo.I've applied a 2.75\" x 2.125\" label to each 1.44MB 3.5\" formatted diskette, for special notes  -a definite plus for organizing photo-shoots.For quality ambient-light photos, I find that a sturdy, retractable mono-pod is essential in any less-than-bright sunlight situations, as the 1/3\" CCD (0.8 megapixel) sensor seems to exhibit a true ISO rating of only about 50 (although Sony optimistically specs a ISO value of 100). So, especially for those long-telephoto shots, the use of a mono-pod is mandatory, for image sharpness.Featuring a 14x optical zoom (5.2mm to 72.8mm) lens with auto-focus option (equivalent to a 37 to 518mm zoom lens on the old 35mm film cameras), the camera has a f/1.8 to f/11 aperture range.Exposure range is 1/60 to 1/4000 of a second, for ambient light, and 1/60 to 1/1500 of a second, in flash mode.The OEM Sony NP-F330 (7.2V, 5.0Wh, Li-ion) InfoLithium battery has adequate power to handle only one 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette, before a mandatory recharge. Attempting to load and shoot a second diskette may produce corrupted image files that are not obvious until uploaded and viewed in your home desktop computer. And don't forget that erasing images in the field still drains the NP-F330 battery, sometimes shutting down the camera before the 1.44MB 3.5\" diskette is completely filled with photos.But I have since purchased a generic NP-F550 (7.2V, 18.5Wh, Li-ion) battery, for all-day shoots, on multiple diskettes.And, as another reviewer noted: This old camera will NEVER be stolen. And I also feel that it's just too big to ever be misplaced or lost.And, at a market value of $ 5.00, I won't hesitate to put it in harm's way, for those demanding shots.I gave this camera a 3-star rating, simply because it's just too out-dated to seriously endorse. But if I had done this review back in 1999, I would have most certainly given it a 5-star rating.","Date":"July 10, 2013"}

{"Title":"The 450Z could be the best digital camera for the money.","Author":"shiltone \"shiltone\"","ReviewID":"RHYGNX61FX76M","Overall":"good","Content":"I started out thinking I was still a year away from affording a new digital camera with the features I wanted.  I decided to hold out for a zoom lens and at least 1024 x 768 resolution, or wait.  After a lot of  research, I knew I wanted an Olympus, because of their excellent optics and  their camera-first, digital-device-second approach, and because my Olympus  35mm point-and-shoot had served me well.I thought my best deal would be  on a used or discontinued model; however, because the original price of the  500L, 600L, and 400Z had been so high (in the $800-1200 range), the asking  prices for these had not come down as much as I'd hoped, and what I had to  be willing to pay had crept up as I shopped.  When I saw what the 450Z was  going for, I whipped out my credit card.  Now that I've played around with  it for a few weeks, I can't imagine there's a better digital camera for the  money right now.  I've compared with a couple of friends that have Nikon  CoolPix cameras, and I suppose there's something that's better about them,  but I can't honestly tell you what that would be, and the Nikon is twice  the money!The 450Z is an improved version of the well-received 400Z, but  at a radically lower street price.  Some of this is due to the packaging --  the 450Z leaves out the FlashPath floppy adapter (typically $70-90 alone)  that was standard in the 400Z -- but clearly the manufacturing costs are  coming down rapidly.This camera performs incredibly well on the  bottom-line measurement:  It takes stunningly detailed and accurate  pictures under a wide variety of conditions.We've gotten used to  accepting less than perfection for pictures taken in other than bright  sunlight at normal distances.  The 450Z adds several categories of  picture-taking where you can now get predictable results:  Flash, macro  (including with flash), indoor lighting, low light, etc.  There are just  enough features to make the camera useful over the range of conditions, but  not so many as to intimidate the snap-shooter.  Because of the intelligence  of the autofocus, exposure control, and white balance, it is still a great  point-and-shoot camera.Many features are related to getting the picture  right at the right resolution, such as spot metering, exposure override,  mode (resolution), different flash modes, macro, etc.  Other features are  related to viewing and managing the pictures you've taken.  You can plug  the camera into a VCR or TV monitor (RCA video jack) and give a quick  slideshow of what's in memory.  You can get around the small size of the  LCD display (and this is one of the better ones) by zooming in on one  segment (out of a 3 x 3 grid) of an image, to make sure the detail is  there.One other feature that other reviewers have found important:  The  450Z will store images uncompressed, if you choose (the file size is huge);  most other cameras up to this point perform at least some compression, even  on high-quality settings.The only thing I couldn't do well -- and this  may just take some practice -- is action shots.  All digital cameras have  some lag between the time you decide to pull the trigger and the time the  image is committed to memory, and this takes some getting used to, but the  450Z is quicker in this respect than its earlier counterparts.  One  significant feature is the \"burst mode\", which allows you to keep  capturing images (about 1-2 a second) as long as the shutter button is  pressed, and until the buffer fills up (seems to be about 6-10  images).Most of us get into digital because of the cost and overhead of  dealing with film and processing, only to have to scan prints or pay extra  to the processor for digital images from film.  Depending on resolution,  you can get up to 122 images onto the standard 8MB memory card before  unloading, and that's very liberating -- no more agonizing over whether to  take another shot!  However, once you play around with it a while, the mind  starts to boggle at the possibilities, and film cameras seem like Stone-Age  technology (especially since we are approaching the resolution of film with  the million-plus pixels you can store in an image now).The 450Z is a  milestone in the improvement of digital cameras, a quantum leap in value  vs. features and quality, even compared to other Olympus cameras.  You  won't believe how easy it is to get breath-taking digital photos.  Get one!","Date":"November 2, 1999"}
{"Title":"Photo-Snappin' Grandma","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1FKQAQG4WVOEZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Purchased the 450Z after a lot of research, have had it for a couple months now and absolutely LOVE it.  Agree with other comments on slow (frustrating) D/L speed using the serial cable, and definitely recommend  the FlashPath reader.  Before you jump to buy a cheaper camera, take into  consideration the features that the 450Z offers that, even if you're a  novice, you'll probably not want to live without, i.e., optical zoom, 8MB  memory card included, and photo settings usually found only on high-end  cameras (overcast conditions, fluorescent lighting, etc.)  One of the best  features I used this week was the ability to take great photos of my  newborn grandson on the delivery table with the flash OFF!  Auto  shutter-speed compensated for the flash off and produced extraordinary  photos!  All digicams are battery hogs, but I was able to take about 120  photos (med res) before replacing them (I rarely use the LCD monitor, and  never use battery power for D/L'ing pics).  You MUST read the manual from  cover to cover before using the camera for the first time, but now I only  refer to it when using a setting I don't normally use.  AC/DC port is not  standard and I was forced to get a converter from Radio Shack that has  several different adapter plugs (cheap).  PhotoShop Home Deluxe s/w  included, but BEWARE -- make sure your PC video card drivers are  up-to-date.  Go to your PC-makers website and D/L the latest updates before  installing this s/w.  I had major conflicts with the video drivers req'd by  PhotoShop and the 18-month old drivers on my Gateway.  All in all, I am  extremely satisfied with the 450Z.  The only improvements I'd recommend to  Olympus is replacing the serial D/L connection with a USB compatible one,  making the camera a little more user-friendly so the manual is not so  indispensable, changing the AC/DC input to something more standard, and  include a FlashPath adapter with the camera.  Unless you abhor reading  manuals and instructions, you won't go wrong with this camera.","Date":"December 10, 1999"}

I have been holding off on a digital camera purchase for more of a value reason than anything else.

I was still slightly fearful that the process from taking shot to  downloading it to my harddrive would be cumbersome; however, this was not  true. The software that comes with this camera is powerful yet straight  foward and easy to use.  The images are great and a lot of fun to have  instantly.  IT WORKS JUST LIKE A GOOD AUTO FOCUS 35MM.Cons:  Uses  batteries quick if you use the LCD and during the download to PC process.  It takes a long time to download a 8mb smartmedia card (30-40 pics @ medium  quality).  It does not come with a case.  The LCD is just below the optical  eye opening so your fat nose smudges the LCD screen everytime you take a  picture.FINAL WORD:  BUY IT  --- IT'S GREAT along with:  1.  Case  2.

{"Title":"Solid Product","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RQ45W9JQVJ6Q0","Overall":"good","Content":"I am very pleased with this camera.  I purchased it because itis more like a \"real\" camera than other digicams I haveseen.  I like being able to choose \"film speeds\" and aperature settings as on a 35 mm.  This is my first digital camera, so it took a couple days to get used to all the controls.  However, the camera takes great pictures on fully-automatic mode, so you can start taking snapshots right away.  I also found that pictures in daylight turn out much sharper than night-time flash photos.  Maybe I just need more practice with the flash settings.I would recommend rechargeable batteries (I purchased the less-expensive Kodak NiMH batteries instead of the Olympus brand).  I would also highly recommend a USB SmartMedia card reader (if you have a Mac or Windows 98).  I bought a Fuji USB reader, and it makes transferring your photos to your PC a snap.  It was easy to install, and it appears as a removable drive in Windows Explorer.  So I just use Explorer to cut and paste from the card to my hard drive.The software is also pretty good.  The panorama stitching software looks pretty cool, but I have yet to test it out.\"Every time you close the lens cover, it hits the lens.\" Not so.  You close the lens cover to the half-way point, the lens will retract, and then you fully close the cover.  Second, \"You have to turn the camera off in order to preview your pictures on the LCD.\" Again, not true. You can leave the lens cover open, and \"double-click\" on the display button.  This allows you to preview your pics on the LCD.","Date":"December 20, 1999"}

We used only the automatic setting and it produced outstanding results without flash.  This has turned into an outstanding camera for my wife, who refused to focus a 35mm.  Since  initial use we continue to be impressed with the features and flexibility  this camera gives us.  We have been able to produce great shots, and with  the ability to edit, enlarge etc. Several observations and  comments:This camera will eat batteries.  We purchased nicad  rechargeable, and are getting similar life compared to Alkaline.  Save some  money here.Purchase additional smart cards, (memory).  We purchased two  additional 16MB and have found that SHQ is the only way to go.  You can't  improve the quality once a picture is taken, but you sure can regret a poor  quality photo.We purchased Flashpath, and really don't use it.  We found  that the serial download is adequate.  NO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO VIEW IN 5  MINUTES, but how many times will you need to?  A 16 MB (full of SHQ) takes  15-20 minutes to download.  I set it up, leave it and come back.  We are  blessed with extra drive space and have started designating a separate file  for each photo set. You can do this with Windows Explorer before  downloading.  You can delete the ones you don't like, and by naming the sub  files you create make it easy to locate and use pictures later.We  purchased Microsoft picture it 4.0.  For most purposes we find it much  easier to use than Adobe, and for the price very useful.  To sum up, my  wife originally told me,\" you take the pictures, I'll just tell you which  ones I want you to print\", BOY HAS THIS CHANGED.  The camera and software  are so easy to use that she is taking pictures, downloading, editing,  printing, AND TRANSMITTING FILES OVER THE INTERNET.  She was telling a  friend about an item she saw in a newspaper ad, She took a picture of the  AD, downloaded the picture, and sent it, all in less than 5 minutes.  We  have only touched the surface of what we can accomplish with this camera.  WE WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO WHATS GOOD PHOTOS WITHOUT HAVING TO  WORK AT IT!","Date":"February 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Good Decision -- Finally","Author":"K. Rice \"kmrice2803\"","ReviewID":"R3G5LSZGAMPF33","Overall":"good","Content":"I joined the digital parade after an agonizing 6 months of comparison and indecision.  I liked the Sony Mavica features, especially the floppy disk method of storing images.  I've used my work's Mavica 91 and loved its  simplicity and great ability to take indoor pictures without a flash.  I  also loved the rechargeable 'smart' battery which Sony sells with its  product; it actually tells you how much time you have remaining before a  battery change is required.  It could also do short MPEG motion pictures -  with sound. The big negative:  it's huge and weighed a ton.  It's  resolution wasn't sufficient either.I finally ended up with the Olympus  450z because of its high resolution, its available floppy adapter, its many  features for the price, and its compact size -- its virtually identical to  my old 35MM model.  It takes great pictures, but isn't as capable in low  light conditions as the Mavica 91.The Panaroma picture capability was a  feature which I never thought of using -- until I saw the software demo  which was included with the camera.  It's like magic -- it puts together a  panarama of pictures into a single composite image.  Truly amazing.In  summary, the 450 is a great camera, albeit only slightly better than the  400 - and doesn't include the floppy adapter as the 400 did.  Great - yes,  but the price really hasn't dropped as I had hoped.  Finally, if you're  thinking ahead, you'll order 8 or 12 NiMH batteries and a recharger, a 16  or 32 meg SMART Card, and the Floppy adapter.  You've suddenly got yourself  a $700-$800 camera outfit.

I shoot mostly slides, adore my zoom and macro lenses and expect a lot from my images.  I was looking at the high end prosumer Olympus (C2000) and Nikon (950).  Drooling is more  like it.  Then I started reading reviews of the D450Z on  [...] and others.  Sounded like a near perfect  compromise.  While the images won't stand up to extreme enlargement, how  often do we really do that with our pictures.  I got the camera a couple  days before heading out on a trip and was delighted with how easy it was to  carry and use.  No more rolls of film to manage.  The images were sharp,  good color balance and I took night time images, hand held, without flash  that would stand up against commercial postcards.  The zoom isn't as long  as I'd like but you can't expect that of a point and shoot.  Get an extra  smartmedia card, NIMH batteries (though I did 56 pics on just over one set  of batteries - with the LCD on).  Olympus' new Smartmedia reader rocks.  Downloads become a matter of seconds.  I couldn't expect more from this  camera.

Camera does eats its four AA alkaline batteries quickly,  especially if you use the LCD a lot. THE FIX: I purchased rechargeable 1400  mv NiMH Nexcells and a Maha C204F charger for under $40 online and neatly  solved this problem.2. Not the most intuitive menu and button system.  THE FIX: reading the manual before trying to use does help. A *quick guide*  sheet comes with the camera...keep it handy to figure out those features  you don't use often. Now I know how to use the features that are important  to me and don't have to refer to the manual any longer.2. Manual is  confusing with three languages/page. THE FIX: English is primarily on the  left-hand pages so look there first. Dog-ear the content index page so it's  easier to find what you are looking for later, and keep the one-page  \"quick guide\" that comes with the camera handy.4. If you are  going to take panoramic photos, ONLY THE ***OLYMPUS*** SmartMedia CARDS  WILL SUPPORT THIS FEATURE! If you purchase less-expensive brands like  SanDisk, you won't be able to take panoramas. THE FIX: Purchase Olympus  SmartMedia cards on auction sites or at bidding sites online...I bought my  Olympus 32 mb card for $45 under the Olympus website price.5. Slow photo  download rate. First of all, I didn't find the serial port download overly  slow, especially compared to other digital cameras. However, since camera  has to be on during the download, I recommend purchasing an AC Adapter  (doesn't have to be Olympus brand) to save on batteries. But if you're a  speed freak, then THE FIX: Purchase either the USB or FlashPath Floppy Disk  Adapter....either will speed up download time considerably.

I received this a xmas present, and have not stopped telling people about this amazing product. My mom, who is not very techy, loved taking pictures and found it very easy to use, but left the  processing to me. The 3x Optical Zoom gives you great close-ups. The camera  is very easy to use, once you figure out the menus. the flash is very  powerful, can make a dark room at night look like a daytime picture. The  video-out allows you to give friends and family a slide show of your  favorite pictures. Color is superior to any other camera I have seen. I  took pictures and printed on Epson 740 with Epson Photo Paper, my mom was  amazed, she thought I had got my pictures developed at the store. The photo  quality was fantastic.

This camera is light and small enough and has all the functionality you would want (except if you're a professional photographer). Once you get familiar with the icons, the camera is pretty  staright-forward. And if you're looking to buy rechargable batteries along  with this camera, do not buy the Olympus ones. I bought the Kodak  recharagble batteries and charger and they work fine. Another tip, get the PCMCIA card for  faster uploads if you have the slot and get the Delkin Devices one, it is  cheaper yet just as good. I saved myself quite a bit of money this way.I  also purchased an additonal 16 Mb NewMedia film card but you can buy other  brands for cheaper.

{"Title":"The D-450 - Probably The Best In It's Class!","Author":"CyberDude","ReviewID":"R128KGV9M1NLB3","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is simply awesome. Take it from me, I'm no stranger to digital photography. I was using my Sharp digital camcorder to take digital still pictures but I was not very impressed with the results. Moreover, a camcorder is too bulky to haul around. So I decided to go with a smaller camera. I did a lot of research before settling on the D-450 camera from Olympus. It is feature rich, looks very cute, and delivers pictures with a punch. It works effortlessly on my Windows XP. My favorite feature is the 3X optical zoom (digital zooms are generally useless). The LCD screen is crisp and clear, although it's use should be limited to preserve battery life (Use the LCD only to review already taken shots. Do not use it for taking pictures - use the viewfinder). The video output works great. I could go on and on. It's comnpatible with SmartMedia which, in my humble opinion, is the better storage medium.Overall, I am quite impressed with the D-450 Zoom. It's simply a wonderful camera. I wouldn't expect less from Olympus. Regarding complaints about lack of a USB port for downloading: Just get a SmartMedia card reader. A good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot. I personally use PNY SmartMedia card reader but any good card reader should do. Not only does a card reader download your pictures at blazingly fast speeds, you also save your batteries by not using your camera to download the pictures.PS: If you are looking to save money, consider getting a refurbished camera. They come with a 90-day manufacturer's warranty and in most cases are essentially brand new cameras. I should know. I got mine refurbished :-)","Date":"June 23, 2002"}

You can use up 4  penlites in an hour of heavy use (especially if you use the view-screen on  the back - that is what really uses the power up).  (Not any different from  other digital cameras from what I read.) 3 Very little documentation, not a  problem for me, since I wouldn't read anyway, but others may want to read  more about it.NOTE: I searched around and other online retailers had  lower prices up front, but after you add shipping and taxes (yes taxes on  some sites) you end up paying more than on Amazon.

SMITH","ReviewID":"R3IH637LDYK668","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the PDC 700 with all kinds of limitations in mind, first and foremost being cost.  I was not going to pay over $300 for a digital camera and I wanted the highest resolution for the least amount of money.  I found exactly that with the PDC 700.  I also bought three Sandisk 16 mb flash  cards, a 32 mb flash card, a battery charger and sufficient nimh batteries,  and a Datafab compact flash reader (parallel).  This last weekend, I  started taking pictures of everything around my house and office.  EVERY  picture I took on medium resolution far surpasses the picture quality I  ever had with 35mm SLR cameras.  The printed pictures were also fantastic  on my Lexmark Z11 printer....  Bottom line, I can take an  infinite number of pictures at a wonderful resolution, crop them if  necessary using the Photoshop LE look-alike software included with the  camera, and print great pictures the quality of which I have never seen  before at a wonderfully low price.  This camera is indeed a quality  product.  The only drawback is the case - it is too small for anything but  the camera, so I bought a larger camera bag that holds all the accessories.","Date":"June 19, 2000"}
{"Title":"A few improvements and it'd be excellent!","Author":"Sneaky","ReviewID":"R2JE197KSI7HF3","Overall":"good","Content":"Polaroid did a pretty good job on this camera. Let's break it down step by step:ADVANTAGES:1) 4 MB built-in memory - this is a fair amount compared to other comparable cameras.2) Compact Flash compatible for  adding more memory - Compact Flash cards are relatively inexpensive - it's  like film you can use forever! Just drop it in, take the pictures, and when  the card fills up, replace it (or use the 4 MB built-in).3) The LCD  display is great. Not choppy - you can even adjust the brightness. It can  be turned off to decrease battery drain. Also, immediately after you take a  picture, it will display the picture on the LCD (whether you have it on or  off) and ask if you want to delete it now? This is great when you take a  picture and look at it and immediately know you don't want it.4) Menu  functions. Once you figure it out, the menu is really cool. You change what  type of light you will be taking pictures in, you can format the memory,  erase all or one picture in the camera, etc.5) The software is great.  You can actually hook your camera up to your computer, and from the  software you can change the camera settings without ever touching the  camera (you can take a picture, turn on/off the lcd display, change flash  formats and picture quality, etc.).6) Accessories. The kit comes with a  TV cable, a nice camera case, a wrist strap, a serial (RS-232) cable for  camera-computer connection, BRAND-NAME batteries (that's a shocker - I got  Duracell ULTRA with mine), AC Adapter, and software. There is also a USB  port as well - I'm going to look into this because serial transfer is  SLOW....DISADVANTAGES:1) Slow downloads. I have a PII-400 w/ 128MB  RAM. Still, I downloaded 15 1024x768 (Fine quality mode - read more about  quality modes further down) pictures that I took, and it took almost a  minute per picture.2) There are 2 settings: 1024x768 (they call this  XGA), and 640x480 (they call this VGA). Each of these settings also has 3  quality modes (SuperFine, Fine, and Normal). SuperFine is the only one  worth taking pictures with. Other modes are grainy.3) Battery Life.  Actually, every digital camera on the face of the earth drains batteries  almost instantly - so this really is just a disadvantage among ALL digital  cameras. That's why I'm glad this thing came with an AC Adapter. Just be  sure to use the AC Adapter whenever you can (especially when you are first  playing with it and fooling around with the LCD - that thing REALLY drains  batteries!).4) I wish this thing came with a USB cable. It has a USB OUT  on the camera, but it's a tiny little connector and I have no idea what  type USB cable to buy for it. Yeah, it comes with a serial cable, but that  is SLOW. USB has GOT to be faster.5) As everyone else has said, NO  documentation whatsoever. Just get on the Polaroid website and pull off the  product manual - that. Strangely enough, the product manual doesn't come  with the camera!All in all, a GREAT camera. Buy it and you won't be  disappointed.","Date":"May 25, 2000"}

We used to take multiple 35mm photos,  trying to capture that perfect print - now we stand back a little further,  take ONE wider image and crop it as required. Lighting is no longer a  problem - we can take an image on any of Cleveland's many overcast days and  make it a good image, again, using image inhancing software. The standard  4MB RAM will hold 12 high res images or 25 medium res images. We convert  the original JPG to a TIF, do our enhancements, then convert back to a  72dpi JPG for images that are posted to our Web site ([...]  Inkjet inside handouts look great as long as you use quality paper.

I sent the camera back to Polaroid and they replaced it with  no questions asked. The new one does the same. We still believe that the  PDC-700 provides us with \"the most digital bang for the buck.\"","Date":"August 17, 2000"}

{"Title":"Bad Investment","Author":"A. Gray","ReviewID":"RMOIOM1GHPGPM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned the PDC-700 for about a year and a half. I would highly recomend not purchasing this camera. I have to admit that I bought it on a whim and the price was right. It's no secret that this is entry level, low priced digital camera so I'll try to present both the pros and cons with that in mind.PROS *Feels really nice in the hands. *Perfect size for me *Great LCD... crisp *Very easy to use *location of buttons, controls, CF slot all well thought outCONS *Picture quality is almost always terrible *If there's an eyeball in the picture... it's red *BATTERY LIFE - don't plan on getting more than 20 or so shots from a high quality set of alkalines using LCD. 25-30 without. *Upload speed very slow. My 700 DID NOT come with USB. The USB  whole was plugged. I understand that the new units come with USB so it may not be an issue... but geez... very slow to upload. If you don't have a USB 700 make sure you use an external CF card reader that utilizes USB. *The camera doesn't seem to remember the settings you provide very well. It likes to change from XGA to VGA etc.. *The battery charge indicator is very inconsistent. One or two shots into new batterys and the indicator shows a dead battery... then it bounces up and down.... usually you don't really have any idea when your batterys have drained until the camera just rolls over and dies.I took tons of pictures with this camera and every time I look at them I cringe thinking of all the memories that were captured with such poor image quality. Please consider spending a little bit more money if you are a sucker for family pictures and such. When it comes right down to it... picture quality is everything and this camera just doesn't hit the mark. I don't really regret having the camera because of the low price and the fun I had screwing around with it.... but I really get bummed looking at the crummy picture quality now. Also, for all the money that you'll spend on duracells and energizers you could buy a much better camera. By the way... you have to use good alkalines.. you can't cheat and use NIMH recharables with this camera.. it only uses about 50% of the batteries before the camera dies. So, if you're like me it means $5 in batteries each time you want to use the camera. Well... the good news is I've just ordered a Canon G1. Life is good.","Date":"June 24, 2001"}

When we got it, the software and all the extra cables etc. that came with it, have made it a pleasure! The PhotoMax software works great and you can do some fun stuff, like put peoples' heads on other bodies! It works great and I haven't had one ounce of problems with it. I recommend it highly.

Keep this in mind when comparing to  cameras that come with battery packs.  -- It is ONLY downloadable on  windows 95/98. Not on the Mac, not on NT and certainly not on Linux.  -- If  you lose the CD-Rom that comes with it, forget about getting the software  you need on the web. As far as i can tell if you lose that CD, you are  [in trouble].  -- You lose the time/date info every time the batteries die,  which is all the time.  -- There is no way (that i can find, admittedly i  haven't downloaded the user's manual from the website...please!), to save  the settings that you prefer.

(even a 20 meg flash card gives you hundreds of pictures at the best resolution and the card reader makes getting your pictures just like grabbing them from a floppy disc.) you probably want to factor that into the price. overall, i think it's a great first digital!","Date":"February 6, 2002"}

You get 4 batteries,  AC adaptor, Serial Cable, USB cable(it does have USB), wrist strap and software.. most other cameras in this range you have to buy these things seperate.  Out of the box it is ready to use..It has 4MB built in memory not much.. maybe 40 pics at its default setting which is very good for 4x6 and 5x7.  I usually download pics to my old pentium 100 laptop via serial right away when its full. But I just got a 32mb Compact flash card(price) which upped it to 300 pics!  The lower settings from 600 to more than 1000 640x480 pics!  Other stuff... It has a timer and is tripod mountable.. most other cams dont have that..  Can record live action onto VHS recorder via TV cable.The BAD: Im really irritated with the waitng time between pics which didnt occur with the PDC-640..  you wait a full 10 seconds between clicks to take another pic, even if you delete the picture right away.

This camera great. The pictures are clear, and the LCD view finder is sharp. It DOES come with a USB cable for faster download time.

Everything works great with the camera, lots of options and once again, great looking photos. I have not yet tried to download the photos and play with them in the software provided, so I didn't give it 5 stars. But I am sure it will work great, along with everything that came with the camera. It is also smaller than I thougth it would be. Very compact but heavy enough to feel strudy.

Windows  95/98\", too bad, the recipient of the gift has a Macintosh.I went  to Polaroid's web site to download a Mac friendly utility for the camera,  but there isn't one. The only suggestion offered by either their on-line  FAQ's or Tech support was to run a window's emulator on the Macintosh, but  they do not offer any support if you choose to go that route.The first  Digital Camera I bought came with support for quite a few operating  systems, and there was no mentions of system requirements in the on-line  camera info (at the time, hopefully that will change) so I really didn't  question it when I ordered this camera. Now, I will be returning the  camera.So, I suggest you look a little deeper when going to purchase a  digital camera, especially if you, like a lot of  \"digital  artists\", use Macintosh's systems and not PC-Window's systems.

Afraid the same thing will happen and I certainly can't afford that.  The store where I bought it doesn't even handle the product three months later.

{"Title":"A great amateur digital camera!","Author":"Jonason Keeton \"Jonason!!\"","ReviewID":"R3L9ZIZOZ4PPFJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I must admit that I like having new electronic toys when they come out.  I purchased a digital camera in 1997 and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then.  However, 3 years later, I stumbled upon the Nikon  Coolpix 800 at a great price and took another shot at digital  imaging.PICTURES: The pictures it takes are fantastic!  The 1600x1200  resolution really makes a difference when making prints.  They look like  they were taken with a 35mm.  This is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality Nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not.  Another feature that impressed me was the fact I could  add additional lenses to it (and Nikon has 3 designed specifically for the  Coolpix 800/950/990).FEATURES: It has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed TIFF format, ability to take B&W pictures,  and adjustable metering.  However, for a non-professional photographer, I  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away.  I now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture, but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box.  Unlike other reviewers, mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a CD-ROM that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic ones.This is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn't want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used.  Otherwise, the CP990 and the  D1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control.  I do  recommend getting an extra Flash card since 8 MB does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in FINE or NORMAL mode.  Getting a USB SanDisk  CompactFlash reader was also a big help since the built-in connection is  serial and can take a LONG time to download pictures if you have a lot of  them.","Date":"April 15, 2000"}

I was looking for a camera that was above 2 mega pixels and $500 or below.  I have read some of the reviews about the low quality of pictures in a dark room, but after playing with the light meter adjustment I did not have any problems with the quality of brightness of the photo.  I even went to the extreme and took some close up photos, outside, in total darkness of a Hybiscus bush.  The photo showed incredible detail and deep rich color from the flowers. I also read some of the complaints about the auto focus always being on and drawing on battery power.  This is only the case if you leave it on this setting.  You can set it to only auto focus when you press the shutter half way.The pros for this camera are: It's easy to figure out.  Takes great pictures. Has lots of features for manual and automatic photos.  You can even take black and white photos. Different lens settings like fisheye and wide angle. Manual and Auto settings.  LCD screen is incredible.  It does have a lens cover. and it is fairly compact.  It's a lot of fun shooting pictures just to see what kind of results you get with the manual settings.  I was able to have fun with this camera right out of the box.  My only complaints are that I wish it came with a power supply, the battery cover is a little flimsy, and the software that comes with the camera isn't anything to get all excited over.  Bottom line is if I had to buy it again I would do it gladly and without hesitation.Hope this makes your descision a little easier.","Date":"December 4, 2000"}

Yeah, they eat batteries like candy, but so do most cameras with any kahonna's. Buy rechargable! The biggest drawback to this  camera is the serial port issue. There's a way around that, though. Buy a  SanDisk (they manufacture Nikon memory cards) drive and USB...uploadin'  quicker than spit. Well, now that we've bought a CompactFlash drive, some  Nickle Metal-Hydride rechargable batteries, an AC adapter, and another 48mb  of memory(or you'll be reminded of that time when you ran out of film),  we've just added about $250 to an already pricey camera. Not to fear folks.  If your reading this review, that means you have internet access. Shop  around for the best price. On-line prices will, without a doubt, beat the  human factor. Try,  Buy .com  for the camera and Spotshop.com  for the  other goodies. I saved a couple hundred easily. Oh and lastly, I wouldn't  have a digital camera without at least 2 megapixels, built in flash,  optical and LCD viewfinder, and CompactFlash(most common). There's lots of  other goodies with this one, and that's why I think this is the most camera  for it's price range.","Date":"January 4, 2000"}

There are a few minor issues that I wish I had known when I was shopping for digital cameras.  I would like to have a little more zoom capability than the 2x lens provides, as well as better macro capability (or any macro at all).  I understand  that the Coolpix 950 has both.  A flashcard disk drive is a neccessity as  battery life is very short (4 AABatteries last maybe an hour). For example,  taking and uploading 14 photos will zap 4 brand new Duracell Ultras.  I did  purchase 4 Nickel Metal rechargeable AA's and that helps ease the pain of  replacing batteries.  It would be nice if they included the AC  adapter, no question this is a must for this camera.  Uploading pictures  from the camera to PC is easy but slow with the provided software.  An  additional photo editor other that the one provided will be neccessary to  do any creative editing.On the bright side, the camera has an  outstanding compact flash and is loaded with nice features that I have not  taken the time to figure out.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this  camera as the quality of photos can help me overlook some of it's  shortcomings.  I am however considering an upgrade to the Coolpix 950.","Date":"December 18, 1999"}

But the reason because I am writting, this new review is to give some advices to those with the same camera: 1- Buy a battery recharger ( a 2 Hours one is great) 2- Buy 8 rechargables AA Niquel-Metal hydraide (choose a good ones, the cheaper don't last) 3- Buy a USB compact flash card reader ( The best investment! ) 4- Buy a 64 Mb compact Flash Card ( It is in most of the cases enough for a short trip) 5- Think before taking a picture, and use the features of the camera, it is so versatile that will allows you to have that great picture,  whatever the conditions, but need some practics. 6 With good illumination use the automatic setting (A)it always get the better picture. 7- With Poor condition use always Manual. set for 200 ASA or 400 ASA depending on the condition, you can even increase the apperture of the objetive manually, do so if you think is needed 8- Finally you need a good software to retouch the pictures they always need to increase the brightness, and sometimes also the gamma. I am using  CamediaMaster from Olympus and I am very happy, it is not the best for retouching, but it the best to managing  and organizing your pictures, besides you can play a slide show without need of create any album, just play the file.  Enjoy your Coolpix and play with it for as while before judging it. ...","Date":"September 25, 2000"}
{"Title":"Superb Images","Author":"Larry Vevig","ReviewID":"R3D0QI1V9XXRDL","Overall":"good","Content":"The images that this camera is capable of producing will be hard to duplicate in any other digital camera that can be purchased for under $600.  Previous reviews have mentioned size, controls, and rudimentary software  as problems.  I don't believe Nikon or anyone else bills this camera as  a 'pocket' camera.  If size is a big criteria, consider the Canon S10. The  CP800 is easy to hold and is not so small that it is hard for someone with  larger hands to manipulate.I find the controls about average for a  digital camera.  Digital cameras don't work like film cameras and require  that you develope new skills.  No matter what camera you purchase there  will always be a learning curve involved.  Most of the controls seem quite  logical and once you are used to them, cease to be a problem.The Nikon  View software is simply a means of getting the images from the camera to  the computer.  From there you can use the image editing program of your  choice to modify or print your pictures.  One of the great things about a  digital camera is the fact that you CAN adjust and retouch your photos.  Many cameras download their pictures via a serial cable and they are all  slow.  USB card readers are inexpensive (around $50) and GREATLY speed up  the process.One big plus is the availability of additional lenses and  filters, another feature not generally found in cameras of this price  range.No one camera is a good 'fit' for every user but if what you are  looking for is great film-quality images, you won't be dissapointed with  the CP800.","Date":"January 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera, minor annoyances","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RCEJ2X48HEXMJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my CoolPix 800 since November and for the most part, I am very pleased with it.  The pictures are great and there are a fair amount of features that the advanced amateur will find useful.  Two major  disappointments however are the inability to control the shutter speed and  aperature, and the battery life.  Nikon's web site will lead you to believe  that you can control the shutter speed and aperature (such as when you are  taking fast action shots or photos at night), but this is not true.  Shutter speed and aperature are automatically controlled no matter what you  are shooting.  To get that kind of control, you need to be purchasing the  CoolPix 950.  Amazon's review that \"battery life is a winner\" is  a crock.  The camera eats battries at an alarming rate even with the LCD  screen switched off.  I have considered purchasing a rechargeable set, but  my solution is to buy the battries in bulk at Costco.  You can get a brick  of 48 AA Kirkland battries for about $12.  These battries are almost as  highly rated (according to Consumer Reports) as regular Duracell's and a  whole lot less expensive.  Unfortunately, not using rechargeables is not  the most environmentally friendly option.  By the way, the owners manual on  CD.  Get a clue Nikon, that one's a real pain!","Date":"January 26, 2000"}

I have had my Nikon 800 for 6 weeks now and doubt I will ever use film again.  The photo quality is fantastic.  Using the normal setting, about 500kb/photo(the high res is about twice the size), the 4x6 prints are indistinguishable from 35mm and are comparable at 8x10.  The ability to image both the light and dark portions (ie the shaddowed areas in a bright sunshine shot) of a photo are far superior to film.  My prints on an HP 862 printer using \"best print quality\" and Kodak glossy premium picture paper are photo shop quality.It is very easy to use. I have spent less than 5 minutes with the manual.  I have shot almost everything on auto exposure with great results. I have had no problem with exposures too dark.Three small negatives (pun intended),  the cycle time between exposures can exceed 2 seconds, the flash is weak, and the Pictureworks/HotShots software included is cumbersome.  The exposure speed, iso 100 equivilent, can be frustrating in low light situations, but this is common to all digital cameras.  You do need to buy a 36 or 64mb... flash card to hold 60 to 120 photos until you can download to yourcomputer.  The 8mb that comes with this (and most other) camera only holds 8 to 16 images.  A SanDisk USB flash card reader...  will quicken the transfer to your computer and save batteries.","Date":"December 9, 2000"}

The extra money is well spent on accessory  lenses, rechargable NiMH batteries, memory cards and reader. The 2X  optical zoom is not a big issue if you add on a telephoto lens -- the  current Nikons all support add on lenses with their threaded barrel, using  the properly sized adapter rings.  Keep in mind that the digital zoom on  the 800, and most digital cameras, results in severe noise and distortion.  I doubt I'll ever use the digital zoom.Image quality is superb, and I  have found myself marvelling at the sharpness of pics shot at full res  (1600x1200) in fine mode, even at fully automatic settings.  Color and  white balance seem very natural, and of course are user-settable in manual  mode. Nikon's expertise in quality optics and metering is very evident  here.Minor concerns are that the battery cover area seems flimsy, and  also the optical viewfinder must be used with the right-eye to avoid severe  nose-smudging of the large LCD, which is flush with the rear case and dead  center so right in nose territory!User interface is quite friendly and  easily mastered with a bit of experimentation on the menus.You WILL want  a USB or PC-card CompactFlash reader as the camera does not include USB  support natively. Serial port transfers are a joke with files this big  (600-900K per pic)!I highly recommend this camera to intermediate  photographers who want more resolution, manual control, and lens options  than a low-end device, but do not need all the bells and whistles of the  $800+ 3-megapixel \"big guns\".","Date":"June 1, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent camera for an excellent price","Author":"Richard Maher","ReviewID":"R2LDZP39RLSRN7","Overall":"good","Content":"If your thinking about buying a digital camera for this price definitely buy this Nikon 800. The 2.1 megpixels far outshine any 1.3 mega pixels cameras. The LCD monitor is like a tv. The battery life is also excellent I  get about 1.5 hours on my rechargeables. Its completely worth the extra few  bucks, why settle for less, as they say.I love this camera ive played  with some similarly priced ones(EG Canon powershot s100) but i still love  the Nikon 800. But so as to help you I'll tell you some points to note  about the camera that some people may not like.1. Rechargeable batteries  are a must,eventhough the battery life is one of the longest around its  pretty much a necessity for any digital camera. Batteries + recharger cost  me 17 dollars.2. The zooming capabilities on digital cameras are not  very good. However for the Nikon you can buy a telefoto lens. 3. The  memory card supplied with digital cameras is always the most basic. The  Nikon comes with an 8MB card which with the settings(picture quality,  picture size) that I have selected gets me about 50 pics. However at the  best pic qualtiy and largest photo size, this card can only store one  photo. However my photos show no adverse degradation in quality or size, so  I do not feel the need to buy more memory.4. There are loads of manual  functions that you may never use, or use only sometimes. But it means that  everybody is happy.  5. It's takes alot of practice(a few days) to  capture moving objects and ensure to get the object at the precise moment  you want it.  6. It comes with a soft, flimsy case , you want to buy  more protection. 7. Downloading photos using the serial port is ok for  an 8MB card. Anything higher than 16MB may become annoying. Certainly if  your impatient get the usb card reader...I would  be willing to pay a 100 bucks more for this camera its seriously that good.  The pictures produced are just of such good quality.Suffice to say Im very  happy with my purchase.","Date":"August 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"A Pretty Good Camera For Your Money","Author":"Christopher Sheppard","ReviewID":"RF8S5VSKCK7B2","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera having never used digital, and I must say I was stunned! It is VERY easily used, and even if you're not electronically inclined, you'll figure it out in about 15 with the help of the QuickStart  guide that comes with it. I will say that for a more advanced  user/experienced photographer, it may seem a little elementary; you can't  change shutter speed (this is automatic), F-stop has very limited  variability, zoom is so-so (though there are a variety of accessory lenses  you can purchase).As for batteries, do yourself a favor and buy some  NiMH rechargeable batteries (takes 4 AA) at radio shack, where a set of  four plus the charger is only 19.99. This Camera is a ravenous,  battery-devouring beast, and you will have to change batteries after 45  mins if you use alkaline. With the NiMH, I have yet to kill them- they last  forever.The auto mode is very user friendly, and does just about  everything for you. The manual mose allows you to change around things a  bit (but does limit you, for example the shutter I mentioned)There are  several different resolutions you can use (the default is 1600x1200, but  you can shoot 640x480 or smaller), and also several shooting options like  16-shot which takes 16 shots over the course of about 5-8 secs, bestshot  which will take 10 and the camera decides which is the best. Or you can  take up to 40 frames per second.You might want to get an extra or larger  memory card because even though they say it holds 200 pictures, this is a  bit stretched. It will hold about 30 basic quality, 16 normal quality, 8  fine quality or 1 high quality in the 1600x1200 mode, and about 200, 100,  50, 5 in the 640x480 mode. Though I WILL say that the 640x480 VGA mode is a  good mode because even a 19\" monitor cannot display a 1600x1200 shot,  and part of it will always be off screen, whereas the 640x480 almost  perfectly fits the screen (I use the 640x480 VGA mode myself). Plus the  1600x1200 shoty takes quite a qhile to upload.Summing it up, if you have  never used a digital before, you will be surprised off you A-- at how easy  it is to use and take good photos. If you are a professional or have  experience, you might want to go with the 900, 950, or 990.I give it 4.5  stars","Date":"June 28, 2000"}

My first model was a 640x480, which looked good in emails, but was really lacking when I tried to print my pictures out.  Next came a megapixel model, which was better,  because it made prints look good, but I couldn't zoom or crop much before  my pictures started looking fuzzy.  It was time for a 2 megapixel model.  I  looked at the Coolpix 950, but it was too big and too expensive.  I looked  at the Canon digital elph too.  It's small and cute, but in my opinion  isn't worth the extra money. I looked at a few other models too,  but I kept coming back to the Nikon.  I think that most people agree that  Nikon optics are about the best available, and they have a good track  record with previous models of film and digital cameras...Good stuff: GREAT pictures; Nikon lens; optical (not digital)  zoom (though not quite as powerful as some); Compact Flash (personal  preference, maybe, but available in bigger capacities); Much more compact  than the 950, with most of the features and the same resolution.Not as  good: have almost lost the lens cap several times already; batteries don't  last too long with lcd on; get rechargeables! Unless you're a hardcore  photographer, this should have all of the manual abilities and photo  quality you need.  If you are a hardcore photographer, you probably want  one of the 3 megapixel models instead...For me, the Coolpix 800 is 80%  of a new Olympus 3030 or a Coolpix 990, but for less than half the price.

Be warned though that you should prepare to spend quite a  bit more than the cost of the camera. 2 sets of batteries and a recharger  are a neccessity and maybe an AC adapter as well. Nikon should try to  include a recharger, nothing kills the digital camera experience more than  realizing that your camera lasts for about 30 minutes before you need to  put in new batteries. Also the 8 MB card is useless. You can only take 1  (!) high quality uncompressed image. Factor in...for a 64 MB  Compact Flash. Likewise I havent found any image editing software (also a  negative with Nikon is you get no printed manual and the basic software is  VERY basic) so you will need to purchase some editing software.","Date":"August 11, 2000"}

{"Title":"Only the pictures are good","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3W260XMFNAVDX","Overall":"good","Content":"I have virtually no digital camera experience and bought this camera about a week ago.  I did extensive on-line research and the reviews were outstanding concerning picture quality.  In this regard the reviews were  accurate. However, I mistakenly thought that picture quality was the only  necessary feature in a digital camera.  Wrong.  I have found many  disaapointing features in this camera.  First, that the camera's manual is  on disk rather than paper is LAME!  How are you supposed to read how to  download and process pictures when your computer screen is tied up reading  the manual. Second, the camera's controls are very confusing.  Many buttons  serve dual (sometimes three) functins which of course you have to memorize  because the manual is only on disk.  (There is a printed pocket guide but  it is an abbreviated version.) By the way, I printed the entire manual and  it is still the worst written electronic manual I have ever read. More  experienced digital photographers may not mind this. Third, the camera has  a cheap feel to it.  After buying it I went to a few stores to see some  others and realized how cheap the feel of this camera was.  Fourth, the  camera is an odd shape and size making it difficult to put it in your  pocket and go.  Fifth, the serial cable provided is a slow method of  transfer.  Purchase of a card reader is a must.  Sixth,  the Nikon View  software is very basic.  Thus, a photo editing program will be necessary.  Finally, the lens cap is not tethered to the camera.  While this is not a  big deal, it is inconvienant, but more importantly highlights the many  shortcomings of the camera's design.  Again, although I have many  complaints I have to admit the picture quality is exceptional.  The  question is would I buy this camera again.  Probably not.  I would trade a  slight reduction in picture quality for a better thought out camera which  is easier to use.  By the way, I have since discovered that the place I  bought it has a 30% restocking charge precluding return of the camera.  I  strongly suggest that anyone contemplating the purchase of a digetla camera  on-line go to a local store first just to handle a few diffrent models and  then check the rules regarding on-line returns.","Date":"December 27, 1999"}

So, running around like that for a while, eats up batteries even more. If you don't want to use the monitor, you have to turn it off when you switch the camera on.Summary: great pictures for a decent price, if you can live with the above.","Date":"October 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix == Slowpix","Author":"\"akyol\"","ReviewID":"RA7SM9IUYOHF2","Overall":"bad","Content":"Nikon Coolpix 800 has two shortcomings:1. The flash is terrible. Almost always, the flash shots come out with the subject bright in the center and the backround completely dark. It looks like a metering/exposure  problem.2. The camera is slow. I take a lot of pictures of moving  objects, my kids etc. Almost all moving shots, the camera takes the picture  a second or so later than the actual shot which means I missed the  shot.If you don't take a lot of pictures with flash or moving objects,  this is a great camera. For me, I went and bought an Olympus C2000Z. Works  great, and has 3x zoom to boot.","Date":"June 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"Bang For Your Buck!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3QKCDY9ATQA5M","Overall":"good","Content":"Wow!  What a bargain!  At a price less than most of the competition (cameras w/ at least 2 megapixels), the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a steal.  This camera has many advanced features, many found on higher-end cameras, although it's still simple enough for novice users, like me, to handle.  With a quick skim the manual you will be off and running.  The layout of the camera is very logical and easy to navigate.  Most people will probably use the autofocus although a manual focus mode is avaliable for more \"advanced\" options for photo-taking.  The autofocus is terrific and allows the user to have a \"point-and-click\" attitude to digital photo imaging while encompassing the advantages of the incoming \"digital age.\"  The TFT LCD screen allows you to have a great view of pictures you have taken and stored on the compact flash card.  The LCD on-screen menu is extremely easy to operate.  It produces superb pictures rivaling many higher resolution cameras.  With a decent printer, you could produce photos detailed enough to rival that of regular 35mm \"professional\" development. The print quality is great and it is enhanced by high quality photo paper.  It is a good idea to do plenty of research on the digital camera topic before you purchase one since it is quite an investment even for the \"cheaper\" cameras.  The included 8mb compact flash card is decent, holding 16 \"normal\" detail 1600X1200 photos, although I would recomend purchasing a larger capacity one (i.e. 16mb+).  Another additional bonus would be to purchase a compact flash reader to download the images.  They are relatively cheap and reduce the download time.  Rechargeable batteries would be an added plus since the LCD display is a battery drainer.  Another important accessory would be a high-quality carring case considering the amount of money put into the camera.  Overall the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a great camera at a bargain price.","Date":"January 6, 2001"}

A USB flashcard reader it is a must, the batteries last enough to shoot at least 100 pictures using th LCD to review the shots, no complains here. Now the down side, the metering system is always taken dark pictures that are too bad on artificial illumination, when you shoot with the flash, only the closer ( I ment 3 foot) is iluminated the rest is too dark and unreadable, only way to overcame the problem, set the ASA to 400, you will get a litle more blurry picture, but at least you will be able to see something. I do not understand why Nikon has not fixed this problem yet. I am a fan of Nikon, but something is wrong in this model, that posible could be corrected with a sofware modification. I have requested to change this unit for other to see if it is a unique problem of this one.  One advice......, ! My (other camera) makes very good pictures, always well illuminated!

Sharp pictures, excellent focusing & light weight.Here are some negative points if that's what you are looking for -1. It is a battery hogger. The 4 energizer (alkaline) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about 20 pictures. You NEED rechargeable NiMH battery. .... Andthe charger is [even more money]. You don't really need the optional AC adapter. It is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the PC.2. The 8MB CompactFlash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default. At normal compression, you can have only 16 pictures. I feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default. 640x480 is only available in advanced options. At 640x480, the 8MB card can hold 102 pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me. But if you want to stick to 1600x1200, you may be better off considering a card with more capacity.I decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable (as in the case of battery usage) or not applicable to all (as in the case of resolution & storage size).I had been using Nikon N50 (non-digital) for years and had fallen love with that camera.

{"Title":"Better than my friend's Kodak 280 -- and cheaper, too!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RUBXFHLSSUJQR","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm always the last guy in my group of friends to do something.  They all  graduated college before I did.  They all got married before I did.  They  all had kids before I did.  And they all bought digital cameras before I  did.  Being the last digital camera purchaser had its advantages, though.  I got to learn from all of their mistakes!  I have a friend with the  Olympus 460, one with a Nikon Coolpix 950 (the fancier version of the 800),  and one with a Kodak 280.  They all bring their cameras along on hikes and  camping trips, so I was able to see all of the pros and cons to help me  make my own purchase.  I decided that I wanted 2 mega-pixels and optical  zoom.  I also didn't want to spend more than $500.  I ruled out the Olympus  right away, because it only has a 1.2 mega-pixel image size and I want at  least 2 mega-pixels so I can make 5x7s or even 8x10s.  Of course, after I  bought my Coolpix 800, I learned that Olympus is coming out with a 2  mega-pixel version of the 460, so if I were buying it today, I'd have to  reconsider. After ruling out the Olympus, I was left with the Kodak DC280  and the Coolpix.  My friend's 950 was outside of my budget, but that's OK,  because I didn't like the shape of the 950 (weird twisty thing) or its  size.  The 800 is smaller and looks and feels like a normal camera.  If you  compare the 800 to the Kodak DC280, they basically look identical.  2x  optical zoom, 3x digital zoom, Compact Flash card, AA batteries, optical  viewfinder, LCD display, etc...they're nearly identical.  In the end, I  figured \"Kodak mostly makes instamatics, and Nikon makes lots of  high-quality 35mm cameras\".  I've heard lots of great things about  Nikon film cameras, and figured that this technology would carry over to  their digital cameras.  Besides, with the rebate, the Nikon is  cheaper!I'm totally thrilled with my decision.  The pictures are  fantastic, and the camera never fails to amaze me with its flexibility.  Though it's not as fancy as the 950, it's LOTS cheaper and is easier to  carry.  Look around: if you want a 2 mega-pixel camera with an optical  zoom, you can count on spending $500 or $550.  This camera has all the  features I need with an awesome price!  Definitely happy with my purchase,  and happy with the quick painless service I received from Amazon.  I can  recommend this camera without reservations.  You won't outgrow it any time  soon, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon lens.","Date":"August 8, 2000"}

{"Title":"Good camera, but go for the Nikon Coolpix 880","Author":"ira_nyc","ReviewID":"R1V0CYCM3LW8JN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Skip this digital camera and go directly to the Coolpix 880 by Nikon (also on Amazon). Why, you ask? Well, this Coolpix is quite old (in terms of digital) and you'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera. Here are the details why:Megapixels. The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures, but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel.  (More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality. ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference!)Zoom. The 800 has a 2x optical, plus 2.5 digital zoom lens; however, the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom.  You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy!Memory. Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash, but most people would agree that this isn't enough.  Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you'll be happy you did.Downloading. The 800 only connects via serial port, but the 880 connects via serial OR USB. THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer, but the serial (800's only method) is horrendously slow.Batteries.  THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries, but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries. The 880's batteries also weigh less.Price. This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ($499) over the 880 ($699).  But let's face it, if you have $499 for the 800, you should fork over the extra $200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year. The 800 is being phased out by Nikon. RUN to the 880 today! :)","Date":"April 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great picture quality!","Author":"David J. Grant","ReviewID":"R3L2NQIHPIFJ3W","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for just over 1 year.  Picture quality out of the camera is phenomenal.  With a high quality printer I get better pictures than I ever did with my 35mm.  I would suggest a minimum of 32 MB compact flash card, but they're cheap now.The serial connection is the biggest problem with this camera.  It can take an hour or more to download 32 MB of pictures and you have to use the Nikon software which doesn't always like W2k.  But a card reader is relatively cheap and does the job quickly without draining the batteries.The optical zoom went out after about 5 months and Nikon quickly repaired it.  I've heard this is not an uncommon problem though.  It's worked great since then though.  We always use the LCD screen and haven't run into a problem with guzzling battery power since we started using the card reader, even with normal batteries.Although I haven't seen better pictures from any other camera in the 2 MP range, the red-eye flash on this one doesn't seem to do much good, and most of the photos with people in them need to be edited if a flash was used.  The menu on the camera does allow you a lot of options and control when taking pictures though.  In fact the camera has two modes - one where more control is permitted and one where most of it is automatic.  Nice if you know what you're doing.All in all it takes great pictures, but doesn't have many bells & whistles for the price and you'll need to buy a USB card reader.","Date":"November 26, 2001"}

I was kinda shocked by how small it was when I first opened it but it's compact size betrays the many features hidden within it's frame.  However, this may be a downfall to someone with  big hands so if you do you may want to find one at a camera or electronics  store before you buy. There was one thing that I did find annoying and  that was the online manual.  The manual is pretty informative but if you  are like me and are outdoors a bit...well the online manual won't do you  anygood, so read up before you try and leave home with it.Other than  those two very minor features this camera more than does the job.  It is  very lightweight and compact yet it has the ability to add various other  lenses from fisheye, macro, and a telephoto.  The flash is powerful enough  to handle most any shot and you have the option to change the film speeds  to compensate even further.  It shoots in standard form at 1600x1200 but  can be reduced to 640x480.  If you want to take high speed pictures, you  have the option from single, continuous, up to an amazing 40 continuous  shots.  This is my first digital camera so I don't know if others have  these features but for the price and the size I can almost bet you are not  going to find one that rivals this little Nikon in quality.

{"Title":"Great camera and GREAT tech support","Author":"Eileen Galen","ReviewID":"RU8DDQ10JEOEF","Overall":"good","Content":"I wanted a digital camera for all the usual reasons. In addition to its usefulness for emailing, my second reason is that I take hundreds of snapshots yearly that I throw out as soon as I get home - sometimes, while still at Kinko's.  It seemed like such a great idea to be able to delete all my duds - before any tree ever has to die for them, or (gasp) any photo lab worker has to see them. This is a great little camera. It is truly a simple-to-use, lightweight thing. I agree with all the praise.  I wish I had known at the outset (if only to spare myself the headache) that the instruction manual - the good, big, complete one that I wanted to read cover-to-cover - is on a CD rom.  Don't plan on reading it in bed, unless you want to first print all 54 pages. The little \"quick\" booklet (missing much material)  that comes in the package has a loosely organized table of contents to the CD, but, inexplicably, no page numbers that would correspond to the topics in the printed material, so you must search. You must buy separate photo-editing software, unless you want to send your nice little photos only to have your recipient download them in in that ridiculous huge size we've all seen.  In addition you will not be able to modify your photos in any way without the software.Four double A batteries were used up in an hour of snapping, viewing, deleting, snapping. When the batteries begin to wear out, the camera gets sluggish, and then it's time. A  rechargeable battery pack (or two) is a must.An excellent feature of any Nikon camera is that the Nikon tech support line is a twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week operation. This is incredible.  I had a few glitches with the Nikon software, and phoned several times. I was helped right away - efficiently and well. That alone is a fantastic plus, especially for someone who is not particularly good with new gadgetry. Terrific.","Date":"February 21, 2001"}

I took it to the dinner that evening and took pictures of the kids and other congregants.  I also took it home and took some great close-up shots.  You can't necessarily tell how the picture will come out just from looking at the LCD screen, but when the pictures were viewed on my computer, they were really nice.  The pictures were clear.  Even though the room wasn't that light, the pictures were fairly bright.  I forgot to change the focus to distance for one picture of the kids on the stage, so it didn't come out that great--oops.  Also, the close-up shots were really nice--even in darkness or low light, when the LCD screen won't show anything, the pictures come out clear and bright.  I noticed two things I thought were unusual.  The first is that the pictures seem to be better when the zoom lens is low or zoomed-out.  If I used the close zoom as opposed to simply moving closer, the picture seemed darker and less clear.  The second--the batteries did start to go low later in the evening.  So, I plugged in the A/C adapter.  I forgot to unplug it, and the batteries were fully-charged in the AM.  I don't think I was sent rechargeable batteries, but having the A/C adapter seems to extend the battery life, so, though I saw the low battery light in the evening on the first night I started taking pictures.  I have used the camera with and without the A/C adapter, and I am still on the first set three days and 40 pictures later. I also do recommend having the USB CompactFlash system to download pictures--it takes seconds to download about 8MB.  I bought a larger disk (32MB) and have used over a quarter of the pictures, and it takes less than 30 seconds to download all of the pictures--they appear quickly and clearly.  I am considering keeping the disks and just buying more like I would buy film for negatives, as the picture quality decreases when I put them into programs on my computer.","Date":"December 25, 2000"}

This camera is my second digital camera, replacing a 640 x 480 clunker.  My choice was based on determining that 1600 x 1200 resolution would be sufficient for my needs, and the Nikon seeming to give the best pictures in that resolution range on the review sites (epinion.com, megapixel.net, etc.).  So far, this camera has not disappointed me.  The picture quality is excellent.  The quality is as good as, or better than anything I have ever gotten with a 35mm SLR.  I have gotten great compliments from photographic friends for the quality of pictures that I have emailed them that were taken with this camera.  The camera does lack aperture- or shutter-priority options, but you can finesse around that with the EV control.  I am also pleased with the black and white and VGA options.  The VGA setting is 640 x 480 resolution, but still better quality than my old one.  This is good if you only plan to email a picture to someone or use it on a web site.

And I've got a new beef:  Due to the small size of the camera,  it is nearly impossible to use it without getting thumb prints all over the LCD screen.  But these notwithstanding, it is a great camera that takes good, well exposed crisp pictures, and that's the bottom line.","Date":"March 17, 2001"}

Apart from that it takes good pictures and at the price it's selling for now it's a good entry into digital photography. The optional lenses are great and will transfer to other Nikon models later if you upgrade.I prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger, because of the way the body twists. This makes it so you can see the LCD when you're holding the camera over your head pointing down, or down by your knees pointing up.

{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 800","Author":"L. Long \"Lisa K\"","ReviewID":"R137KG3A9GXZAD","Overall":"good","Content":"I am really enjoying this camera. It is very easy to use as a point and shoot camera as well as having the manual mode for the more advanced user. I am the in between user. I have been enjoying learning how to take great shots with this camera. The paper book manual is very basic and will get you started right away. It is really easy to get started. It also has a little \"quick guide\" pamphlet so you can find basic functions fast. Then it comes with an in-depth reference manual on a CD-ROM. This I felt was a little inconvenient. I'd rather be able to page through a book quickly to find what I need, but others may like the CD-ROM manual. But I would not let that deter you from buying this camera.I bought this camera because of the higher resolution (the 2.11 megapixels) to be able to print quality photos. I plan on using Amazon's Ofoto site to have them printed as well as printing them on my Epson. Of course I love to email my photos to everyone as well. But so far the picture quality is great. Especially outdoor shots. The flash for indoor shots could be stronger. This seems to be the norm with digicams having a harder time indoors. Up close is fine but the back of the room is dark. There are ways around that using the manual mode. The software that came with the camera was very generic. So if you are very into editing, I would buy additional photo editing software.Additional things that I bought were rechargeable batteries and a charger. I drained the batteries that came with the camera in one day of usage. The LCD really drains the batteries. I also bought a 64mb compactflash card from Lexar. The 8mb is just not enough. Especially if you were to go on vacation. The Lexar card came with a jumpshot cable (a memory reader). It was very reasonabley priced. You just plug the cable into the USB port in your computer. Then you take the memory card out of the camera and put it into the reader. This helps out because you don't have to plug your camera in all the time to download your photos and it won't waste the batteries. Plus it is faster than the serial cable that comes with the camera. One thing I might mention about Lexar's jumpshot cables is that they will only read Lexar cards. But for the price of the card that included the jumpshot cable it was well worth it. And it was so easy to use.I still plan on getting a nicer case for my camera. One with more padding. And if you were go on vacation, you would need a spot for the batteries, the charger and also the software if you need to download it to a computer.All in all I am very happy with my purchase. I had been researching it more months on sites like Megapixel.net and ZDNET as well as other camera reviewing sites. The price was exceptional for the quality of this camera and I would highly recommend it.","Date":"January 27, 2001"}

{"Title":"Possibly an unfortunate fluke","Author":"Hans Kreigsman","ReviewID":"R2RKF26VY7H2A5","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 800 sounded like a great buy in a full-featured digital camera. Unfortunately, when mine arrived at my doorstep, after unpacking it and following the quick-start instructions to the letter, I took one test  photo, and the camera began to buzz and an ominous statement \"system  error\" flashed on the LCD screen. The only way I could even shut off  the camera was to open the battery bay. The comprehensive manual on CD said  that if this message appeared and a restart didn't fix the problem (it  didn't), the only action was to phone Nikon. Since this was a new camera,  right out of the box, I didn't bother, but packed it back up and returned  it the following day.  There are many good things about the camera, but in  my short time with it, other than the obvious fatal flaw, I noticed that  the battery compartment cover and smartcard cover were both very flimsy  (noted in other reviews). I feel that both of these will get extensive use  during the life of the camera and are prone to failure. Perhaps the major  fault was a fluke, but I won't be replacing this with another coolpix, or  probably with another Nikon.","Date":"March 29, 2000"}

{"Title":"Excellent Color and Detail","Author":"James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"","ReviewID":"R1PHEUOBVS5JV4","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  & small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.  JLW/991203.","Date":"December 3, 1999"}

The software is easy to  install, and only has about a one hour learning curve to master.  Very good  and fast usb connection.

{"Title":"Better than I expected!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R226K61WJPEXOJ","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall, this is an excellent camera and I've had nothing but great luck with it.  The pictures are terrific.I had heard a lot about the DC280  and similar digital cameras chewing up batteries, so I bought an extra set  of rechargable NiMH batteries -- in addition to the set that comes with the  camera.  While this is still a good idea, I didn't find that the battery  life was particularly bad.  On a recent trip overseas, I shot over 150  pictures (many with flash) and still had good battery life when I got home  -- enough for another 75 pictures.  Just don't use the LCD preview screen  for every shot -- that's not what it's intended for, and it WILL kill your  batteries pretty quickly.The real limitation is the Compact Flash  memory.  If you shoot the highest resolution possible, the camera will fill  a 8mb card (which is what is supplied) with only 9-12 pictures.  I  typically get 32 hi-res pictures from a 16mb card.  (The number of pictures  you get will vary depending on the complexity of the images you shoot.)  So, in addition to an extra set of rechargable batteries, think about  buying the highest capacity Compact Flash card you can afford!If you're  thinking about getting a higher resolution camera than the DC280, keep in  mind that you'll get even fewer pictures per megabyte on your Compact Flash  cards.  Personally, I found enlargements up to 5x7 printed by Ofoto nearly  impossible to tell from film pictures.  I'd only recommend a 3 megapixel  camera if you intend to print 8x10s regularly.A USB Compact Flash card  reader is a great option, too.  It saves the camera battery and allows you  to quickly download your pictures without tying up the camera.","Date":"July 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great for Web images","Author":"John Harris Stevenson \"tranquileye\"","ReviewID":"R274RKHULC4IZG","Overall":"good","Content":"Although it sometimes feels like we're all still beta testing various digital imaging technologies, including digital cameras, products like the Kodak DC280 make me believe the \"dark ages\" might be coming to an  end.This is a good mid-range digital camera, perfect for those who want  to capture images that will look very good on the Web. The biggest plus of  the camera is image quality; this is the best camera in this price range  that I tested, with two-megapixel resolution. Having quite a bit of  hands-on experience with various Sony cameras, I and my partner were  actually stunned by how clear the DC280's images were in a variety of  lighting conditions.There is very little to complain about in terms of  interface and usability. I scanned the manual, and then just started using  the DC280. The menu system and buttons are quite intuitive. One minor  quibble is that one is pretty much forced to use the DC280's viewfinder  left-eyed; otherwise the LCD screen smudge factor so common to digital  camera will rear its ugly head. However, I use the LCD for the majority of  my shooting, so this isn't a huge factor.The DC280 uses a USB connection  to transfer images to your computer. The camera mounts as if it were a hard  drive, and one can preview large thumbnails of images before copying them  over to your hard drive. While I was able to open the images directly into  Photoshop, Fireworks couldn't get into the camera; this may have been a  problem with how I have my file associations set up, however.The camera  comes with a number of features and extras. The bundled software, Adobe's  PhotoDeluxe and Pagemill, are more than adequate for editing images and  creating Web pages. Various simple visual effects and borders can be  applied in-camera, and you can run a slide-show right out of the camera  using the supplied video cable.The DC280 includes four rechargeable AA  batteries, a recharger, and four AA alkaline batteries. You can get started  right out of the box. My camera sucked the alkalines dry after about 50  photos and a couple of downloads; I would suggest buying an extra set of  rechargeables to carry around with you, and an AC adaptor.This is not  the perfect camera for all applications. For one thing, there are few  manual controls on the camera for focus, aperture or shutter priority, and  the optical zoom limited to 2X.  This will mean that photo enthusiasts  might want to look at something the next step up, such as the wacky-looking  Nikon Coolpix 950. As others have reported, low-light shooting is not at  the quality that one would hope for from a camera at this level.All-in-all, the DC280 is an excellent camera for the price, perfect for  Web photos.","Date":"May 17, 2000"}

I tryed the same picture with the three different qualities and with all I got excellent pictures.  It has all the basic features you might need in any camera.  It has a good zoom, the 'physical zoom' is not that good, then I discovered the digital zoom which is great.It consumes a lot of batteries, but you have more than enough with the rechargable batteries and of course, the battery charger included in the camera.  I bought an additional charger because I never found that the camera came with its own,  so don't buy another charger.I'm more than satisfied with the 8MB flash card.  It is true that you can only take 12 pictures with the highest resolution (1800x1600) and higest quality, but with standard resolution(800x600) and the medium quality you still have very good pictures and can get about 52 pictures, which is good for a weekend.  If you have a long trip and don't have a pc to download the pictures, then you might consider another flash card.BAD THINGS:  It weights a little bit more than a traditional camera of the same size, but still, it's much better that other big cameras. It doesn't come with a camera bag.  You have to buy it appart.In summary,  a great camera.","Date":"October 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent, all-around - but tough for action shots","Author":"A. Switzer","ReviewID":"RZNQ2D914YXT5","Overall":"good","Content":"I finally upgraded from my original 2 year old Digital Camera - a Casio 5000SX that was great except for a poorly designed battery door. The Kodak DC280 Zoom is better in every category - clarity, features, memory capability, analog zoom, except for one - the delay in the time from pressing the shutter until it snaps the picture. Keep in mind, that the processing time is quite fast - the Kodak is ready to take your next picture quite quickly, thanks to some in-memory processing, but the delay from when you click the button until the action is captured is quite lengthy. I find it nearly impossible to get good action shots with this camera. For example, I take quite a few pictures of sand volleyball on my weekends. Only the highest flyers - the guys that can jump out of the sand and hang like Vince Carter were captured in the air, and only with me clicking the shutter button at least 2-3 seconds *before* they jumped. However, if you don't have to take a lot of action shots, well this this is an excellent camera for the money - for both amateur and professional alike.","Date":"September 26, 2000"}

The reason I ultimately bought it was because it was a great value--including many extra items ( both 4 alkaline and 4 NiH rechargeable batteries, battery recharger, Adobe software, UBC Cord, etc.)that the others did not.  However, I was concerned because there were reviews that mentioned that the Adobe software was difficult to use and you could not e-mail pictures using it. Both negative comments were dead wrong.First, I must say that the camera takes truely OUTSTANDING pictures.  It is also relatively easy to use.  The manual that comes with it is well written and easy to understand.  It comes with a quick-guide and you can literally be taking pictures within minutes.The Adobe software is truely outstanding too.  Its only negative is it does not come with a manual so you have to plow through the instructions on the computer and very often use the help screen. However, you can make all kinds of adjustments to your pictures and come out with a first rate pictures.  I like to save the pictures to my hard drive in the JEP format. If I want to e-mail them, I simply  send the pictures as attachments from there.  No problem.Regardless, the pictures and the software are great and any negative comments you may read from others probably are from first time buyers like myself who got frustrated with the learning curve and time it takes to get to know a new camera, new technology, how to use the software and how to print photographs.  For a novice, it takes considerable time to learn.  There are no shortcuts. However, once you get the hang of it, you get  fantastic results!!!One mistake I made was buying a card reader.  I have a 800mh processor and the USB cable that comes with the camera literally takes seconds to transfer.  If you have a slow processor, you may need a card reader.One thing  I definitely advise you to get is an AC adaptor.  It is a must or you will drain the batteries.  If you are going to go for a long weekend or plan to take a considerable number of pictures, you may want to buy both extra rechargeable batteries and an extra picture card.Ihave a HP deskjet 952 printer.  I have found some Kodak 4X6 borderless print paper.  It comes with one or two pictures per page.  For the single page, I turn it upside down in my tray (with the Kodak name up) and locate it all the way to the far right.  I set the settings just the way the instructions say and I get the most unbelieveable pictures you can imagine.  Once I got the hang of it, people in my office asked me where I was getting them developed! Another major positive is that Kodak has a \"technical help desk.\" I called them a couple of times regarding how to use the new paper with my particular printer.  They have an 800 number,answered right away, and were incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  This was a major plus and helped me over several frustrating humps.Regardless, this camera is a great value since it inclues many extras and provides outstanding quality pictures.  Beginers do need to invest time--and be forewarned it can get very frustrating but it all falls into place with time.  If you are on the fence, buy it.  You will love it!Enjoy!!","Date":"November 22, 2000"}
{"Title":"Overpriced but very good photos","Author":"rna","ReviewID":"R2SJRXYECQ4OHU","Overall":"good","Content":"Digital cameras are here to stay. As much as I'd like to stay with my old SLR, it's time to move from film to disk. I've had the Kodak 280 for 3 months and I'll say that it was a good buy. The pictures are very good,  it's easy to use - just point and click. As with any automatic camera, you  don't have great control over exposure and lens settings, but for indoor  and typical outdoor shots, its fine. The USB downloads fast compared to  serial. The rechargeable batteries dye after about 30 downloaded pictures  to your PC... get the optional AC cable (I think 39$). Everything digital  is overpriced for what it is. My camera does sometimes act quirky; but I  think it always has to do with low batteries. You'll have to get another  set of the rechargeable nickel metal hybrid batteries if you go on the road  with your camera. And the software is ok. The downloading should be easier  when you don't want to touch up your photos.I'll keep my 35 mm SLR for  those vacation trips where I'll take 10 rolls of film and I want more  camera control, but if you want instant, good quality pictures in an  everyday, take it anywhere camera (as long as you don't need more than 35  pictures before downloading), this is the camera.

Some of these, I've taken duplicate pictures with 35mm or APS, and the colors on this camera (DC280) comes out way ahead.A case in point, one ocean picture by the DC280 showed detail in the distant fog, along with varying reflections (of the fog) on the water. Dark blue sky filled in behind and above the fog.  The APS picture was all washed out - you could hardly tell the difference between the fog and sky. Both were taken with automatic exposure settings, and taken within 1 minute of each other.Down side to this camera is that 1) It eats through baterries (common problem to these types of cameas - fortunately Koday supplies NiMH rechargable batteries); 2) Limited zoom range; and 3) LCD display gets washed out in the sunlight.Up side to this camera are 1) Excellent sharpness in prints up to 5x7 - okay in 8x10; 2) Colors that will knock your socks off (much better than the Nikon Coolpix 950 that I use at work); 3) It acts and feels like a real camera; 4) Software and Camera operations are very natural and easy to learn (I'm still stuggling with the Nikon, and I'm a computer engineer!)Bottom line: This is an excellent entry into the digital world. It outperforms cameras that cost much more. If you can live with the limited zoom range for now, you won't be disappointed.","Date":"January 9, 2000"}

Let me begin by saying there is no better camera package out there for the price.Best features:  The picture color is excellent; camera controls are very logical and easy to use; uploading to a computer is a breeze: 4x6 prints look like 35mm prints but 5x7 start to get grainy.Okay features:  Zoom is decent, nothing a few steps forward can't cure; and battery life is short so keep an extra set around and buy the optional A/C adapter for uploading.Needs improvement:  The picture size is too long or too short which ever way you want to look at it.  I end up having to cut off the ends to make a printable 4x6, so the picture is actually 1.7 mega pixels instead of 2.0; the auto flash gets confused easily and I find myself having to use the manual flash and risking red-eye;  the software needs a lot of improvement, it's not user friendly and crashes my computer now and then... but it's free; action pictures come out fuzzy and many great shots have been lost becasue they were out of focus.This camera has been great and I would recommend it to anyone.

Before I go on, let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the Kodak 3400.  However, I see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the 3400 (no rechargeable battreries).Let me talk about the camera.  It is very simple to use, yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers.  The annoying feature that makes me give this a 4 star rating is the location of the LCD screen - I found that if I use my right eye (which is my dominant eye) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the LCD screen and smudges it.  Come on Kodak, that was a goof.  This does not effect the quality of piuctures, its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the LCD clean.Other than that, it is terrific.  I immediately purchased a Sandisk 32 meg compactflash card, and have since ordered a 128 mb card ....  Battery life is long (I do use the power save mode, which is not on by default).A few tips.  Once you experience digital photography you'll discover that, just like videos, things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it.  Also, this does have a limited telephoto power with just a 2x optical lens - not a problem for me, but you need to know what you want (if you want much more than 2X, I think you should look at an SLR model).Buy this one, its a great value.","Date":"October 22, 2000"}

But after receiving it, I realise that I would have gone with the Fuji  Finepix had I seen the Kodak in person. The Kodak is much bulkier, and the  lens cap has to be manually replaced and is easily knocked off the minute  you put it in your backpack (actually the stupid thing is always falling  off!).

In fact, when I try to transfer to email, the program locks up and so does my computer, which was 192 megs of RAM and Pentium II at 350.

{"Title":"This is by far the best digital camera out there.","Author":"\"johnrocker74\"","ReviewID":"R2C8K86GKTK7YR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just got mine in the mail on Friday and I must have taken about 300 pictures already (mostly of my cat who now feels like Cindy Crawford).  The pictures (mostly indoors) look spectacular.  I love the fact that I can  preview and chose the pictures I like.  I have been a long time 35 mm user  but I think my Canon EOS will now have to retire for good.The camera is  very easy to figure out. I have never even picked up a digital camera  before this one, but it only took me 20 minutes to figure everything out.  The controls are clear and easy to understand.  I was amazed by the quality  of pictures (both indoors and outdoors).  The camera winds into place ready  to take another picture within seconds (I understand this is a big problem  with some other digital cameras, even the KodaK 290 which is far more  expensive, that take forever to get ready for the next picture).  Focusing  is as easy as with my Canon and I was able to preview the pictures right  away, first on the camera, then on my computer and finally as a slide show  on my TV (great feature for family gatherings). You can also see what a  picture would look like before you even take it. I also managed to use the  framing feature for some cool effects, as well as the B&W feature to  make some of my cat's picture look very \"astistic\".  There are  several other features (like the ability to record date and time on the  Picture)  but it would take too much time and space to mention.Now the  bad things.  Battery life is miserably short, and if you plan to use the  screen in the back of the camera to review your pics, then good luck. You  definetely need to get an AC adapter  so when you are reviewing your  pictures at home, you don't waste batteries.  And when you go out take at  least 2 set of baterries with you.  The software that came with the camera  crashed my computer a few times (and I have a 600Mhz Pentium III).  I  understand there are some downloads that I need to get, so maybe that will  fix the problem.  And my big complaint, I payed so much money for camera,  but all I got with it was a measly 8mb card that holds less than 20  pictures. I had to shell another $140 for a 64 Mb flash card so I can take  as many pictures as I want (well, not really, I think it is about  100)Overall though, this camera is perfect for beginners (who never used  a digital camera before) and experts.

Sell you film developing stock, because at the rate these cameras are improving, film will shortly go the way of the Victorola and the telegraph. The DC280  is small, fits well in your hand, does EVERYTHING film point-and-shoot  cameras do, including a modest zoom capability (for framing), and much  more.  You can preview your pictures and discard them on the spot, thus  saving room for more pictures.  You can get a 96MB Compact flash memory  card (think of it as the \"film\" of a digital camera) which will  hold hundreds of pictures, (great for vacations when you don't take your  computer).  The flash recharges quickly, the LCD lets you frame the actual  picture, the viewfinder works well when you want to conserve your  batteries, and the auto focus is flawless.  Kodak maintains a web page and  I have already upgraded the \"firmware\" (the cameras operating  system).  The pictures, even at the large 8\" x 10\" are stunning.  If you can't get great pictures with this camera, stick to buying  postcards.It comes with everything you need to get going, including  alkaline batteries to start you snapping, while the included rechargeables  are charging in the included charger.

Considering the huge difference in  price, the Olympus is a bargain. Of course it does not zoom, but you can  hardly call the 60mm of the Kodak a real zoom. Having used zoom lenses on  35mm SLRs for years I can testify that the 30 to 60 zoom is more like  medium wide angle to normal view, rather than true zoom. You will have to  buy an accessory 2X lens and adapter to get true + zoom. If you want a less  expensive, good performing, zoom camera, check out the Olympus D450 Zoom.","Date":"January 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"digital kodachrome","Author":"Nick \"ndoble\"","ReviewID":"RVELR0HC5962G","Overall":"good","Content":"Have you ever taken Kodachrome slides - the color saturation is upped a little, as is the contrast; everything is a little realer than real.  And why not. Kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color,  and they have applied it to their new-fangled digital cameras.  You will  not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor - can a  digital camera really be this good?  It looks like a Kodachrome slide -  heck, it looks better!Printing is another thing.  The reason pro  photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the  range of contrast is much greater than prints - prints can only reflect  light, not generate it, as can a slide projector or computer monitor.  So a  great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light; and as even your  basic printer can print at 300 dpi, the lower resolution of the digital  camera makes its effects felt.  However, I find 8x10 prints at the highest  resolution of the DC280 quite acceptable (using a HP832c).  But the camera  cannot make uncompressed files - all files are JPEG compressed to some  extent, and the artifacts may show.  This is a point and shoot camera;  no control of focus, shutter speed, or aperture is possible. The camera is  a little heavy, and you wish for hooks for a neck strap. You wish for more  buttons on the body of the camera, rather than having to go through levels  of menus.  The lens front is very vulnerable (and the lens cap is not  automatic) - it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding  metal or plastic guard, as some of Kodak's competitors do.I find the  battery life using Kodak's supplied metal hydride batteries quite  acceptable, particularly if you buy a second set; but the supplied  alkalines lasted only through the evening I bought the camera.I am a  wide angle person rather than a telephoto person, but in an ideal world, a  3x rather than a 2x would be welcome - 60mm (equiv.) is hardly telephoto.  This is basically a wide angle to normal lens.I've been a darkroom  photographer since 1952, and a sometime professional since 1959 - I am  delighted to see the end of chemical photography, with its dangerous  chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results  in color.  Now all you need is a digital camera and an ink-jet printer.  Prices are falling - give it a try!","Date":"June 15, 2000"}

The only negatives I can think of is: 1) the battery life  is short and 2) while running high resolution you will only get about 12  frames with the included 8mb card. If you purchase this camera I would  recommend a higher capacity card and an extra set of rechargable batteries.  I have connected this camera to a Windows 98 machine (a snap) and to a  Windows NT machine (not recommended because NT doesn't support USB) and to  a Windows 2000 machine.  On Windows 98, the installation was a breeze and I  was up and running in no time.  On Windows 2000, I had a bit of trouble  getting the camera to work properly.  It will not work out of the box but  once you install the necessary patch from Kodak it works fine.  To Kodak's  credit they don't advertise the camera as 2000 compatible but it would be  nice if they would update their software or instructions for folks that  need to use the camera with a 2000 machine.

The Sony is the only one with no Zoom, but has the best picture quality and the best  lowlight exposure. There is also the DSCF505 which has the huge 3xzoom  lens, but it is too big to be nice. The Sony is also the smallest and the  easiest to use. The operating system is similar to the DV camcorders. The  second best is the Olympus C-2020 due to its zoom lens, the viewfinder and  just weaker in low light conditions. The 130 pictures will fit onto a 64MB  Smartmedia in HQ, a little more than with Sony. The Kodak I liked the  least, mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors  (in comparison).

All of the  reviews I read spoke of the wonderful resolution (that's what made me  decide on this camera) and they were right!!!  The photos download quickly  (via USB).  The camera controls are a snap to use.  The instruction manual  is easy to read.  I alternate between two sets of rechargeable batteries  and have no 'battery life problems.'  The DC280 is similar in size and  weight to my regular (35 mm) camera.  So far, the only 'negative' thing I  can say about this camera is that the LCD window does get constantly  smudged by my nose when looking through the viewfinder -- but it's really  no big deal.  Bottom line, it's a terrific camera!  I have a lot of fun  with it!  If you're looking for a moderately-priced digital camera, look  into the DC280.  I think you'll be glad you did!","Date":"August 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Happy happy joy joy","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1OTAUXW1G45SK","Overall":"good","Content":"Within 10 minutes (thanks to the included batteries) I was taking photos.  The camera's interface is clear and understandable.  I suppose if you're challenged by a disposable camera, you might not get it, but if you are a  normal human, you can do this.  On the PC side, if you can open a file in  Word/Wordperfect, you can get to your photos.  With the USB interface, it  was more plug-and-play (emphasis on play) that I'd expected.  I expected an  hour or two to learn the \"how to's\", but hey, this is easy.  I'm  a LAN manager and ex-semi pro photographer in college, so I was less than  enthusiastic when my wife said we should get one.  But now that we have it,  I love the instant gratification that the DC 280 has.  Yes, the resolution  is not as good as film, but unless you're a real pro or have a need for  prints larger than 8x10, who cares?  I'm filling up my digital photo album  so quickly that I'm gonna need a CD burner.  Ok, bad stuff: your nose (if  you're right eye'd like most) smudges the LCD.  If you use it a lot, you'll  need more batteries but so do other cameras.  Hmm.. that's about it.  Last  words-I have no hesitation giving this camera a \"buy\"  recommendation.  Or in the words of the stock market gurus: \"Market  outperform\".","Date":"May 16, 2000"}

The camera arrived two days before the birth of my grandson so I had very little time to learn how to use it before I started taking pictures in the hospital. It didn't matter. The camera was really easy to use and the results were amazing. The pictures actually seem sharper than ordinary film photgraphs. I've been using the medium quality, high resolution mode which gives me seventeen pictures on the 8MB card. So far I've blown the pictures up to 5X7 and they have great detail. When my grandson was 4 days old, I took some more pictures and used the built-in \"new baby\" frame feature. People could not believe the professional quality of the prints. By the way, I am using an HP 932C DeskJet printer with HP glossy paper with excellent results. I do find the HP Photo Printing software easier to use than the Adobe Photo Deluxe software that came with the camera. In net, the Kodak DC280 is a great bargain.","Date":"November 2, 2000"}

{"Title":"One of our most terrific decisions ever","Author":"C. Antonsen","ReviewID":"RRTZS6P72YVGJ","Overall":"good","Content":"was to purchase the Kodak DC280.  We did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera, including reading reviews of many different digitals from customers on Amazon and other sites.  We quickly learned what the major issues of importance to us would be:  (1) picture quality; (2) battery life; (3) convenience/ease of use; and (4) overall value, considering 1-3.  We decided on the DC280 because of the features, above average customer reviews, and the price.That said, we remained a bit concerned about battery life and convenience.  As you can see from all the reviews, digital cameras (this one included) have the reputation for eating batteries and we didn't want to trade film and development costs for battery expense and the hassle of always changing and buying them.  Take this as gospel:  if you do not use the LCD screen as a viewer to set up your shots, you will enjoy surprisingly long battery life.  We regularly snap more than 100 shots (a week's worth or more) and then pass the camera around to let everyone review them on the LCD screen.  The batteries last if you just take reasonable, minimal care, and with an extra set of rechargables you will probably never feel the crunch, even as snap-happy tourists on vacation somewhere.Second, we had read that upper-end cameras (in the $600-1,000 range) could snap pictures rapidly one after another but that cameras such as the DC280 had an infuriatingly long lag time from one shot to the next--up to 12 to 15 seconds--while the camera processed and saved the data.  We braced ourselves for this inconvenience.  STUPID US!  It took two weeks before we realized by accident that you can take up to four or five pictures in very rapid succession before finding the need to cool it for a few seconds.  That is fine, and since we're not professionals needing to do rapid bursts for sports shots all day, we find no difference compared with how strenuously we used our film cameras (in fact, we get a whole lot more out of this one than our film cameras).There is a lot more I could go on about, but the short of it is that this camera is amazing and has itself dispelled many falsehoods we read about cameras in its price range (and higher).  We have two little children and buying film, developing it, making duplicates, and mailing them out to family everywhere had become a real financial burden and hassle.  Consequently, we barely took any pictures anymore.  With the DC280 now, we have snapped more than 600 pictures in 5 weeks (the equivalent of 25 rolls, $250 for film and development).  Everyone in our family already has a CD with 500 pictures on it, with more on the way.  And we now have photos for our own collection that we otherwise would never have had.If you have any doubts about which digital camera to choose anywhere near this price range, jump at this one before you miss out.  You'll love it.","Date":"November 28, 2000"}

Buy this camera!","Author":"Caldwell","ReviewID":"R2GFPQQJ5EHWW8","Overall":"good","Content":"I have taken over 200 pictures so far and I have only had this camera for a few days!  The pictures are unbelievably clear, sharp and of course Kodak colors!  I am using the standard resolution (896x592) with the best  quality setting, I am able to store 32 pictures on the included 8MB compact  flash card. I haven't experienced the battery drain as other users have  mentioned; I am even using the LCD extensively to compose the picture.  I  enjoy the fact Kodak has included 4 AA alkalines(to get you started) and 4  AA nimh rechargeables plus charger with the camera, in comparison - the  Canon S10...you have to spend an additional $90-$100 to get the  rechargeable proprietary battery and charger.This is a outstanding  camera for the money and Amazon has the best price I have found (and I  searched a long time) on the DC280!","Date":"July 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera at a great price.","Author":"Frederick A Schreur","ReviewID":"R3SEBK70T8XY68","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for about two months and have taken over  500  pictures and couldn't be happier with its performance. Pictures taken  outdoors were exceptional in all respects (color, clarity and detail).  Pictures taken indoors are always more challenging due to lighting  conditions,  but the DC-280 has more than enough exposure compensation  adjustments for your use that there is  really no reason for bad picture  quality.  It does take a little practice to take consistently good indoor  pictures,  but it has a great owners/instruction manual that is very easy  to read and follow.The rechargable batteries are a must with digital  cameras as these cameras draw a lot of current with the LCD monitor  activated.  I would also recommend purchasing a larger Compact  Flash Card,  as the one sold with the camera is only 8Mb.  I purchased an additional  32Mb card which now gives me enough capicity for many pictures (over 200 at  a medium resolution).I have taken a number of pictures at the highest  resolution setting and proceeded to print them on my HP Photo quality  printer using Photo quality paper and have been delighted  with the  results.  I print most of them in the 5\" X 7\" format size and the  results have been amazing with virtually no  visable pixellation.  It is  very hard to tell these photos  from conventional film photography.  I have  also printed a  number 8\" X 10\" pictures with great results.This is a great camera for a great price and it has my hearty  recommendation.","Date":"August 15, 2000"}

While I'm not quite ready to retire a couple thousand dollars worth of Nikon Equipment, you can bet my wife's point-and-shoot days are over. The image quality for this  price is outstanding (kudo's to Amazon for blowing away the competition on  price). I added a 48 MB CF memory card, enough for about 70 shots at the  highest resolution. You'll want to do the same since the 8 MB included  isn't nearly enough.  I've tried transfers via both USB to Win 98 (cable  included) or serial to Win NT (ditto). USB is obviously the way to go, but  serial is tolerable.Then I use any editing software (a version of Adobe  Photo Deluxe is included and not bad, but I like MS PhotoDraw 2000) to  resize, color-fix, etc. You can go nuts manipulating the pictures, but odds  are you won't need to. I've used the camera in bright sun, low-light and  everything in between and haven't been able to fool it yet.Cool nifty  feature - the self running slide show. Hook it up to your PC, or even a TV  or VCR (again, cable included), and you can let the camera scroll through  all the shots on your memory card. My 2 year old loves watching it, and it  beats Barney, right? One tip - get an AC adapter if you plan to spend much  time hooked up to your PC/MAC or TV. No sense wasting precious battery  juice when you don't have to.Complaints? The flash, viewfinder, and  light sensors all line up right where I want to put my fingers, so I'm  re-learning how to hold a camera. Also, there's a brightness dial on the  bottom of the camera for the LCD display. I always seem to slide it  accidentally. The result looks like a thermo-scan of Junior and Fluffy in  the back yard, but it's only the LCD. The image itself is still fine.For the price of a good 35 MM camera body, get yourself a great digital  companion or primary camera. Now if we could just get Nikon to make a  digital camera that takes all my old lenses for under $1,000...","Date":"June 27, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great Camera for the First Time Digital Camera User/Buyer","Author":"The Shealy's","ReviewID":"R3VMH1RQ55P1XR","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased and with so many choices on the market I was very concerned about deciding which camera was the best for me.  After reading all the reviews on Amazon.com I decided on the Kodak DC 280 and what a GREAT choice.The camera is VERY easy to use.  I am digital camera stupid and even I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening the box.MEMORY.  I took the advice of most reviewers and bought a 32MB flash card.  A very good decision which I highly recommend.  What none of the reviews told me was that the 32MB card holds about 50 pictures when you have the camera on the highest reslution.  If you go for medium or lower resolution you of course get a lot more. I just use my camera for everyday pictures and the 32 MB card is just fine.SOFTWARE.  You must have software to download the pictures from the camera.  The DC 280 comes with Kodak's camera control software, a very simple picture manipulation software called Arcsoft, and Adobe's photodeluxe 2.0 and Adobe pageMill 3.0.  The Arcsoft program is baby simple and I was using it with no problem to do my first picture downloads.  It even lets you do basic picture manipulation.  If you just want to take pictures for everyday memories or internet postings then this is all the software you will ever need.  I was a little scared that the PhotoDeluxe software would be to complicated to use so I didn't download it till last week.  Turns out It too is a piece of cake to operate and its much more powerful than the Arcsoft software. I now use the Photodeluxe software over the Arcsoft. Bottomline, the software that comes with the camera is VERY easy to use and unless you are a big time or serious photographer its all the software you need.DONLOADING PICTURES.  I download pictures directly from the camera to the computer and its doable but slow, especially if you downloading the entire memory card.  My next purchase is to buy one of those flash card readers which other reveiwers recommend.BATTERIES.  The camera comes with one set (4) rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  I would definately get a second set of rechargeable batteries, but not another recharger.  As long as you have one set of batteries ready to go you will be fine.  And if you don't have any batteries recharged ready to go you can always use regular batteries.  If you take pictures using the normal and recommended \"Capture\" mode the batteries will last through an entire 32MB memory card - no problem. Plus they only take a couple of hours to recharge.CHARGER.  If you do not get one of those flash card readers I would difinately buy the AC/DC adapter.  When you download pictures directly from the camea you are using up battery power.  It would be much easier to plug the adapter into the camera instead of having to change out batteries which typically happens to me somewhere in the middle of downloading my pictures.CASE.  The camera doesn't come with a case and I wish I had one.  I would recommend you buy one.BOTTOMLINE.  I recommend you buy this camera, a 32 MB memory card, a memory card reader, an extra set of rechargeable batteries, an AC/DC adapter, and a case.","Date":"January 1, 2001"}

This camera gave me good results on a recent trip to Europe.* the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera.  I took over 80 photos before I needed to change the batteries, and was not too stingy with the review mode.  That is not great but certainly not as bad as I was led to beleive.*  the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot, unless you are super careful.  Get used to it.* The software isn't that great, but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with.* The camera is not very good for action shots, but that was not a major issue with me.* the camera is a little bit big, compared to say the Canon Elph, but not really too big or heavy.This camera is very good value for the money, I might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras.

Halff","ReviewID":"R20KSSY95YLJ86","Overall":"good","Content":"The camera produces excellent pictures, but has some usability problems. For a two-megapixel camera, the price is excellent. The usability problems vary in seriousness. The power switch has only one resting position and  hence doesn't indicate the power-up status of the camera. There is a  power-saving mode, but no power-down after a period of inactivity. The lens  cap is an old fashioned plastic disk that must be manually placed over the  lens; even my old QuickTake 150 had an integrated power switch and lens  cap. The unit also struck me as being rather heavy. The interface to  Windows computers is excellent. Retrieving photos is as easy as opening a  volume that automatically mounts on the computer. Particularly useful is a  camera control application that makes for easy adjustment of all the  camera's settings. Mac users are not so fortunate. Pictures must be  retrieved with a special Picture Transfer Application with an exceptionally  bad interface and inexcusably slow operation. There is no camera control  application for the Macintosh. The camera has some formatting features such  as borders and special effects. It also provides for video output. I  haven't tested these features and can't comment on their usefulness.","Date":"June 26, 2000"}

There are very few good digital cameras in this price range...that have the features that I need. It has a 2 megapixel resolution, easy to use LCD display, and it uses a Compact Flash card. It's also fairly easy to use.Did I mention the pictures? Wow. I used to have a Pansonic digital camera and it wasn't as good as this DC280, (okay, so it was only a 1.3 megapixel). The picture quality is excellent. I really don't have to modify the images, sharpen them, or adjust the lighting within Photoshop. I basically crop the pictures, and send them out.A really nice add on was the rechargeable batteries and recharger that were included with the DC280. Of course, it came with 4 AA standard batteries, too. :-) You can also buy a lens adapter so you can add on different lenses, such as super wide angle and telephoto lenses.A reviewer did mention that the LCD screen is in an awkward place, so your nose does smudge it quite a bit. Also, sometimes the lens cap falls off the camera lens, but it is attached to the camera at least, so at least you won't lose it.I purchased a 64 MB compactflash card to replace the 8 MB card that came with it. You should try to purchase it on-line... Amazon had it cheaper. I also bought a USB Compactflash card reader which was so much easier and faster to use than downloading the images from the camera (the DC280 also supports USB).If Amazon doesn't have the camera in stock, you can find it at Buy.com--it'll take a few days to get it. I believe it's the previous model before the DC3400, so it might be difficult to find now...You're better off buying this on-line instead.","Date":"December 12, 2000"}

I simply read in the instructions which slot the USB plug went into on the camera -- I had already plugged it into my computer -- turned the camera mode to \"connect\" and flipped it on. Windows recognized the camera, and the photo wizard in XP allows very easy transfer into a folder of your choosing. You can also get the photos directly from the camera and bypass the wizard, but I haven't felt the need to do that.The photos themselves have pretty good color -- I do have to up the contrast more often than not in Paint Shop Pro, but that's not a big deal. The colors, if the light isn't that great, tend to be a little washed out, just like a regular camera.Overall, I love my new camera and have found nothing to complain about. It has performed beautifully and it's easy to use. I recommend this camera to any newbie who wants a middle-of-the-line machine.","Date":"March 21, 2003"}
{"Title":"First Digital Camera","Author":"Joseph Fitzgerald","ReviewID":"RT1GP7FWKQTHB","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera and I am very pleased. I alsobought a H.P. printer for under ($). You loose some resolution with digital , but the color is astounding. More importantly you can crop and fix up pictures so that the photos you do print ( I do 2 on an 8 1/2 by 11) are perfect for a photo album. I also get clear plastic sleeves ( Office Max) that have holes for binder and protect picture.Also there is an abundance of on-line storage sites to park pictures you don't print ( Freedrive.com is one site). There is a learning curve with the software ( must save photos in jpeg format to e-mail), but it is not that difficult. The USB download capability is very important and makes downloading get done in under a minute. I had some fear after I bought it that I wouldn't be able to figure everything out, but I am very pleased one month into my ownership. You will need battery recharger and 4 extra batteries to rotate into camera, but this is not a significant cost. Again, the color resolution is outstanding and the ability to edit the photos ( crop, enhance, lighten or darken) allows for a lot of creativity. I am having a great time with it.","Date":"November 10, 2000"}

Produces excellent quality  pictures, the one flaw however that I've noticed is that when taking  pictures in doors in a low light level *without* the flash, it tends to  blur the image if it's either a motion picture or you move it before it's  finished. This only seems to occur without the flash (I was taking horse  action pictures and didn't want to scare them) and this seems to dissapear  at around 1/90 of a second exposure time.

I have ordered prints online  from my digital pictures, and they look great, even the 5x7.The zoom is  a little lacking, so if you use a zoom lens all the time, this may not be  the camera for you, but Kodak does make an adaptor to go to 4x.I am very  pleased with my purchase here on Amazon.com.","Date":"June 22, 2000"}

It takes wonderful pictures, even on the lowest resolution settings. It's very easy to use and compact. I had a USB conflict with the camera but Kodak Tech. Support resolved it expeditiously. The only drawbacks are minor.. Kodak could have spent a little more time on the lense cap design, as it comes off easily and a regular neck strap would be better than the hand strap. My recommendations are to upgrade to at least an additional 20mb flash card, consider an extra set of rechargeable batteries and possibly a card reader. Even without the above, the camera functions solidly. You can even view your photos on your TV in a slide show with the provided cable! I would not hesitate to recommend this camera to anyone.","Date":"November 2, 2000"}

It is very user friendly and consistently takes good pictures, no matter who is taking them (Unlike several Sony's I tried before settling on this one).Their are several features on this camera that make it particularly appealing to me.* Accepts any type of AA battery and comes with rechargeable ones* Transfers pictures through USB (can also get a compact flash card reader, I highly reccommend).* Has a Video patch cord that allows you to preview pictures on any TV or VCR with an RCA input.* Accepts Flash Memory of any brand up of 196 MB+ (alot of pictures).* Border software allows you to import different borders for your shots, such as birthdays and weddings.Although the camera is only a 2.0 megapixel, I've learned megapixels don't tell the whole story for the quality of a picture. They only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above 5x7 (8x10 takes a dip in quality).Overall a very good camera for an enry level to average user.If you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs, you might checkout the Nikon coolpix 900 series, a very good camera, though it is twice the price of the Kodak 280 zoom.","Date":"January 11, 2002"}

It's been bumped, knocked, and dropped and still takes pictures as good as when it came out of the box.The use is simple enough for even a manager (like myself) to use. Most of the time I just point and shoot and the pictures come out just fine. I like being able to manually adjust the exposure because I find myself inside and not allowed to use the flash. Most of these indoor pic's come out fine.I'm about to graduate to a higher pixel camera but will pass my faithful Kodak onto my son.

{"Title":"More Than Meets The Eye","Author":"Anthony Harmon \"HarmMac\"","ReviewID":"R31XSFCFXHEPWY","Overall":"good","Content":"The Kodak DC280 is exactly what a serious SOHO user or amateur photographer should be looking at as their bottom-line diigital camera. I researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and  price to come available. When I saw the DC280 for $447.00 (compared to the  near-$700 it was a few months ago), I knew the time was right and pulled  the trigger...Everything I need in a personal/professional camera is  basically here. The photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything  you'd expect. When people see a photo from the DC280 printed on the HP970C,  they are taken aback at how good it really looks. One of the greatest  sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the  quality of the paper that was used. I have hundreds of family photographs  from the 1940's to 1999, which vary widely in how clear they look. But no  matter how good the best studio photographer's shot looks, it cannot  surpass the clarity of the DC280's best pictures.The DC280 is not a  perfect camera. There are saturation problems, as well its greedy use of  batteries. The 8MB FlashCard that comes included has to be one of the  reasons the camera is so inexpensive, along with there not being any AC  adapter included.The Kodak software works perfectly in Windows 2000, but  is flakey in Windows 98 SE. However, one hidden bonanza came to light when  I used ThumbsPlus 4.1 to acquire the images off the camera; you can save  them as lossless TIFF files instead of the default JPEG files that the  camera uses.This camera will help my business and will help me be as  creative as I want to be. It was worth every penny I spent. You should give  it a try as well...","Date":"July 3, 2000"}

This camera is special. I have tried many other cameras & though this is not a high resolution camera, the photos come out great, at times even better than high megapixel cameras.

The 280 has a more limited zoom (2x as opposed to a 3x), but the picture quality is amazing.  You cannot buy a 2MP camera that takes sharper and more realistic pictures than the 280.  The new Kodak series with the docking ports are made differently and they are not as good about focusing or sharpness of image.  The 280 is a great investment!!

I have enjoyed it much and definitely like it better than my wife's 35mm camera.You can develop hardcopy photos 4X6's through Kodak for $ each and they have looked great for me so far.  Mostly though I just keep the photos on my computer or send them in emails to friends.  2 Megapixels makes for great looking photos and allows me to crop or re-size them to make jpeg files that fit my 19 inch monitor's resolution and that still look very good.I like it that you can see your photo instantly on the small display screen, although it is pretty small and still hard to see if you caught that smile.Also there are no processing costs or time spent waiting for processing as you can use your USB port.  It takes about a second per photo to download to your computer.  I did have problems with the USB with my old computer that would cause it to reboot and then work, but now my new Windows2000 PC works excellent with the Kodak camera and USB.The 8MB card that comes with it is too small in storage capacity, and I am planning to get a 32MB very soon. The 8MB card holds at minimum 12 high res photos.There is about a one second delay between when you push the button and when the camera flashes the photo, so you have to wait and hold the camera still so it is not so good for moving objects or sports events.Also the zoom is good but not good enought for the sports events I go to for great distant shots.  The zoom lenses broke on my first Kodak 280 and they sent me a new one the same day I sent they old one back.So overall the experience has been very good with this camera and I have alot of great photos to prove it.","Date":"March 30, 2001"}

I inherited it in like new condition. I'm a \"moderate-advanced amateur\" photographer, own several cameras including a Sony/Minolta DSLR. This camera, as others have noted, takes VERY good pictures and is well made and easy to operate. Many times higher resolution just isn't needed, especially if you do a lot of web photography like I do. Put an upgraded CF card in it (a CF slot instead of SD/XD/whatever are another sign of quality) and you're good for hundreds or even thousands of shots!The only down side is that it *is* slow by today's standards. Its highest ISO is only 200 if I remember correctly (maybe not even that high), and CF write times are a bit on the long side. The proprietary USB/Serial connector is annoying in 2011, the original cable for mine is long gone and you can't use a standard USB cable - which isn't a real big problem since I generally use a card reader anyway.I'd say this camera is much better built, and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 \"blister pack\" cameras out there - as long as 2MP is enough resolution.","Date":"November 22, 2011"}

There are more up-to-date cameras out there with a lot more goodies if you are going to put out that kind of money for a digital point and shot.","Date":"March 19, 2002"}

The detail in the photos along with the color are excellent.  Its alse easy enough to use that you don't have to read the booklet.  The little LCD sreen is not great but it is useful.  It will also print out an impressive 8X10 even though 5x7 is where it really shines.It also does a good job with photos to put on the web whether you are trading pics with distant friends/family or selling items on the net or auctions.  The close-up feature is really great to show detail when selling items as detail helps bring more money when selling/auctioning.This is just a great camera and now there are many opportunities to get it for a lot less than cameras that don't really do much more for the simple photographer.","Date":"November 28, 2001"}

Taken in mind the stunning results this camera is capable of producing, its ease of use, and its usable range of features Im sure it can be a great asset to any first timer digi-cam user. Not only does this camera look good but so do the prints. O.K the feartures are a bit limited, and the zoom could be more powerfull, but consdering the price, this camera offers a lot. Unlike some cameras you dont need to go out and buy loads of accersories, the 8mb picture card included is enough to get the snap happy photographer started, and rechargable battries and charger are also included.

That makes the 280 a remarkable camera, because the output is truly remarkable.  With a good printer, the photos from the Kodak DC280 rival those of the finest 35 mm cameras. If I wanted to be \"picky,\" I could fault this camera for short battery life, but I don't.  The answer to that criticism is simple.

{"Title":"Great product ? but beware Windows NT/Dell glitches","Author":"Vincent Toolan","ReviewID":"R10QXNPLQ7Z35Y","Overall":"good","Content":"Not much to add to the very favorable reviews here: as a novice photographer, I'm delighted with my new 280. Take it out of the box, scan  through the instructions, point, zoom and shoot. The digital zoom works  fine, and the special effects (especially black and white) are fun.Two  features of digital photography are an absolute joy: first, the ability to  review your shot right away, and discard it if it's not perfect (leading to  much higher quality end results without wasting lots of money on film); and  second, the way to drop the flashcard from the camera straight into a PDA  (I have an HP Jornada running Pocket PC) for an instant pocket photo  collection. This passes the stringent test of \"would have been science  fiction just a little while ago\".Here's the word of warning: I have a  Dell laptop running Windows NT. The connection from the camera to the PC is  very erratic. Kodak's helpline support was very good - they advise lowering  the transfer rate on the COM1 port by forcing it not to find the camera (ie  disconnecting it and waiting for the dialog box). This does work, but means  you have to wait a long time for your photos. NT does not support USB, so  investing in a card reader is one solution; another is to drop the  flashcard into the PDA and transfer from the PDA to the PC. Hardly  satisfactory - a shame to let down such a great product this way.","Date":"August 9, 2000"}

My wife normally will behead anyone she attempts to photograph, but after a week with her family, she came back with a card full of wonderful pictures!  She flipped through the manual and  took of with it.  Setting up the software was a breeze.  (Even if you  don't buy this one, get one with USB support.)  The camera shows up as a  device in Explorer, so you can look at the pictures instantly, only  downloading the ones you want. The pictures print at 5 x 7 with crisp  resolution.  We were replacing a well-loved Yashica 35mm that was stolen,  and thought a digital would be nice. I researched different models, picking  this one based on the CNET reviews and desired features.  After a month, I  could not be more pleased!  The one I bought was advertised on the web  with a 20MB flashcard.  It arrived with an 8 MB card.  I phoned the vendor,  they said their website was incorrect, but they sent me the 20 mb card  anyway.  I do recommend that you purchase a card with more capacity than  the 8 MB that is now standard.  A PCMCIA flashcard interface is nice if  you use a notebook PC that doesn't have a USB port.  An AC adapter is  vital.  I notice that the price is dropping almost daily, so the Bang for  the Buck is improving.  Based upon my experience, this camera is a definite  winner.","Date":"May 15, 2000"}

One major problem is with downloading into the computer with this; It ususlly takes several tries and many times just hangs up after a few pictures when it does down load. There are usually errors like no pictures in camera when the flashcard is full. The problem seems to be with the \"twain\"transferring pictures,That is the only way. No one can figure what the problem is but it seems to be the software that came with the camera and the Kodak software that is needed no matter what digital imaging software is used. (I tried 6 different types with all the same problems). Out of frustration I bought an HP photosmart 1250 photo printer that I just plug the flashcard into. With that I usually get outstanding results; the pictures look just like I took them with a Nikon SL 35mm camera.If I could only get the computer download to work as well I could not ask for more.

{"Title":"another perspective","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RT78JTBX8Z5D6","Overall":"good","Content":"As a former pro-photogrpher and now web/graphics developer, I had heard the usual negative comments about digital cameras.  And I am, to say the least, a fanatic about quality.  However, when I saw this camera (looks alone) I had to have it.  The response from other digital camera owners is generally raised eyebrows.  Other reviews here reflect those concerns: \"It's a great camera, but no optical viewfinder?\"  Yes, I thought so myself at first.  But consider the following:  The lens rotates vertically 180 degrees on the camera body allowing the photographer to hold the camera directly overhead - or anywhere down below - yet still see the LCD pefectly.  The advantage?  Complete mastery of that universally dogging fact of photo-life, PERSPECTIVE - the single most important factor in any good photograph's composition.  To my knowledge, the F505 is the very first hand-held camera in the history of photography to accomplish this.  So whatever is lost by the lack of a viewfinder is compensated ten thousand times by this magnificent fact.  Further, when I took my first photo (indoor with flash), my jaw dropped to the floor.  I could read the cover notes on CD cases across the room.  Color?  Absolutely precise.  Frankly, I had never seen anything quite like it.  The new version - the F505v - adds the TIFF format for pros, which places this camera precisely at the pinnacle of its class.  Drawbacks?  There is a slightly noticeable lack of extremely tiny detail in certain type of outdoor images.  And, as with all digital cameras, dynamic range could be improved. But all-in-all, the F505 is, in my view, the hands-down, all around winner.","Date":"October 12, 2000"}

One of the best features is the ability to take pictures which are saved in two resolutions, high res plus a smaller format for emailing.  The memory stick technology is very cool.

Downloading is a snap with  USB connection to the camera, plugging into your pc's serial port, or my  personal favorite, purchase the optional pcmcia card into which you can  plug the memory stick -- similar to using USB.

The included memory stick is a  little small but Sony sells memory sticks as large as 64 meg, which will  hold 110 images at the camera's best quality, and 200+ images at  \"average\" quality. A couple of memory sticks and an extra battery  make a good kit to travel with. I recently spent a week in Paris and London  and took 700 pictures, offloading them each night to a laptop.

The picture quality is excellent, and it supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200.  The image sizes range from approximately 100KB/picture at 640x480 up to approximately 400KB/picture at  1600x1200.  The majority of the photos I have taken have been approximately  200KB/picture at 1024x768.  As a result of the relatively large image  sizes, I highly recommend using the USB interface to the camera.  Image  transfers from the Memory Stick are much faster via USB as compared to a  serial connection.  You can also capture MPEG video at resolutions of  160x112 and 320x240.  The unit takes a little getting used to in terms of  holding it comfortably while taking pictures or shooting video, but other  than that it is nearly perfect.

The resolution and features are truly incredible for a camera in this price range. The software installs easily and has good  help information to guide you through the image editing process.The  camera comes loaded with many nice features. About the only thing lacking  is an optical zoom. I'm a frugal consumer and decided that the added cost  of an optical zoom wasn't justified for my intended use of the camera. Most  features have been covered in other reviews but one nice feature that I  haven't seen mentioned much is the video out jack and cable (included) that  allows you to view your photos on a television. My parents are in their  80's and don't have excellent vision, so the television connector lets me  share photos with them without them having to peer at the tiny LCD  screen.Accessories add a substantial amount to the cost of your camera  outfit. Expect to pay an extra $100 to $250 above and beyond the camera  price for them. I bought a SanDisk SmartMedia 32MB memory card, a DigiPower  Solutions 12X rechargeable power pack, and a SanDisk SmartMedia USB  external drive for downloading onto my PC. The only problem I encountered  was with the Sandisk SmartMedia USB external drive. The install software  had trouble locating a device driver, but I was able to locate the correct  driver at the Sandisk web site and get things working properly.

I spent some time comparing the features of different brands and  models in the $300 to $800 range.  Dollar for dollar this camerea is very  hard (impossible?) to beat.  What you get for twice the price isn't that  much more with the exception of a zoom.  Zooms are a mixed blessing anyway  because so often you get blurry pictures (because you don't use a tripod).  Plus, you usually give up some close-up ability when you have a zoom.  The  zoom might be more important if you don't have some photo editor software  to crop, enlarge, or otherwise manipulate your digital pictures.  Some  minor concerns.  I find the look and feel a little \"clunky\"  compared to other Olympus cameras and other brands.  Also, the new models  are less iMac friendly.  So, I bought an Olumpus SmartMedia Reader which  added to the cost but is a very cool device.  And battery life?

I've been very happy with it so far--used it as my only  camera on my trip to Hawaii with great results.  Be warned, it goes through  batteries quickly--we got some rechargeables that helped.","Date":"March 15, 2000"}

I had been reading the customer reviews for several days on  Amazon, and was very much prepared for the short battery life, only 30 good  quality photos with a 8 mb smartmedia card etc. BUT, was i surprised !  Not only does a set of 4 AA batteries (good quality, i.e. Duracell or Sony)  last for the entire 8 MB shoot, but it also allows for a full /  unrestricted use of the flash. To make matters even more impressive, you  can take as much as 122 pictures (standard setup) and the quality of these  photos is amazing. Only if you download these photos and zoom in 2-3 times  into the photo will you feel the 'mosaic', but for ordinary folks like you  and me, we dont need to zoom in that much, and standard photos itself is  extremely good. Furthermore, if you view the photos on TV the clarity is  even more amazing. One thing though ... viewing 'portrait' pictures on TV  is a strain on the neck and the camera does not have any builtin feature  which could switch 'portrait' pictures to 'landscape'.  For usd 299 .. this  camera is a steal !","Date":"April 30, 2000"}
{"Title":"D360-L vs. D460-Z","Author":"Robert Hastings","ReviewID":"R2UWJZ4FTEQ10L","Overall":"good","Content":"I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","Date":"June 17, 2000"}

It has thousands of options, great image quality, and, of course, it's digital!  Now you can take all those embarrassing photos of yourself without being afraid of the CVS guy laughing at you.If you lower the image quality you can take 122 pictures on the ultra-small disk provided.  However, the quality is really, really bad (640x480 highly-distorted JPEG).  But on good quality you can take 36, which is enough for one session (you can delete the images from the camera after you download them to your hard drive.)  There's a super-high quality option which makes TIFFs, but I never use it.A few drawbacks:the graphics-editing program that comes with the camera SUCKS.  If you plan to do major photo-editing you should get ahold of Paint Shop Pro (jasc.com) or Adobe Photoshop (adobe.com).  Another problem is that the batteries run out very fast.  It uses four AA batteries every time, which last me about two weeks.  If you want to save on battery life, try not to use the LCD screen and instead take pictures the \"normal\" way.  Also, try not to view the photos on the camera and instead download them to your computer first and view them from the hard drive.Despite these problems, it's the best deal you can find for so little money.  Unless you can afford to spend 800 bucks on something better, this is definitely the way to go.  Anything cheaper probably sucks.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Impressive and Fun.","Author":"Gib","ReviewID":"R3TQMZI0V43DWN","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera, although I've used them before. After getting to know it and adding some much needed accessories, I can say it really is a great camera, at a reasonable price. The quality of the pictures is astounding considering it is a relatively basic model. The first thing I would recommend ordering with it is a Sandisk reader. This is cheap and a must have; it downloads all your pictures in an instant and thus saves the clumsy,time,and battery-consuming process of loading them by direct camera-to-computer method. If you've read about the battery life problem you'll be prepared for burying the included batteries on the first day. Others recommend rechargeables, but I've always hated them. They don't last long, and I don't like the hassle. I put in new lithium batteries and they really last. As far as actual picture taking, the only two negatives I see are problems with blurry images of moving subjects and  the lack of a real zoom feature. The zoom feature on this camera merely crops in on your existing image. However I see these  points as minor as the beauty of the picture quality, and sheer fun in using this camera make it a winner. Besides, if you want to zoom in on a shot, just take three or four steps in, and you'll be saving yourself about ... bucks. Out of all the regrettable purchases I've made in my life, I can say this is not one of them. Be careful though, being able to erase and retake shots may lead to severe camera addiction.","Date":"November 22, 2000"}

The instructions aren't anything to write home about, but they suffice.  The included software takes a little getting used to but it does do the job, just not as easily as some of the aftermarket stuff. The most  amazing thing about this camera (compared to both 35's and other digital  cameras I have used) is that it is almost impossible to take anything but a  high res. perfect picture. The macro mode is fun too, and good for online  auctions or any application where a detailed closeup is needed.  I am very  pleased with my purchase. The only negative is that the batteries do not  last that long and either rechargeables or a transformer are needed.","Date":"April 4, 2000"}

I also bought the standalone mediacard reader; it installed on my PC like a champ  with absolutely no problems.  Together the two components make for a great  experience!  Even the 8meg card that comes with the camera seems roomy  enough for the kinds of web images that I want to mostly make.  My only  criticism is that there is a considerable delay from when you push the  button until the picture is actually taken -- but I see this same phenomena  with other cameras (both film and digital); it seems to have more to do  with focusing and red-eye reduction than anything else.

The picture quality is much better than I expected it to be, and it is very easy to use.  I was also impressed with the software that comes with the camera and what I was able to do with  pictures after I took them.  Its amazing how good pictures come out in low  light with no flash.  Since it is so much less expensive than the 450 Zoom,  it doesn't have a traditional zoom, it has a digital zoom, which functions  like a traditiional telephoto lens.  So when I want a zoom, I walk closer  to the subject.  The camera lets you take perfect pictures only 4 inches  away from your subject, and that is pretty cool.  My advice:  If you have  $500, get the 450 zoom, if you don't want to spend that much, the D360L is  a great camera and I'm very satisified with it.","Date":"March 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"excellent camera","Author":"Giuseppe A. Paleologo \"gappy\"","ReviewID":"R2JVPIGO9M70AJ","Overall":"good","Content":"The little Olympus is an excellent digital camera for photo amateurs (like me and 99.99% of you). It's rightly considered excellent value for the price, for a number of reasons.Images: the quality of images ranges from  very good to acceptable. The resolution is high enough for album-size  prints, and for web posting. As far as I could tell, the optical group is  good (no distorsions and luminosity gaps).Usability: shooting commands  are very easy, although exposure correction and \"film\"  sensibility can take some time to set up. Nice features are the ability to  shoot sequences and to have wide/spot exposure meter. The \"macro\"  option works fine, but the \"2x\" option is almost worthless to me.  It's better to magnify the section of interest in the editing  phase.Built-in editing: the camera commands are also very easy to use  (you just have to keep the shutter closed). You can view your pictures on a  TV without needing a computer. You can zoom over a picture section. More  important, you can easily store/access/erase pictures, and the quality of  the LCD screen is good (brightness can be adjusted). Downoading images on a  PC/Mac is straightforward too. Overall, it took me less than one hour to  become aquainted with the camera proper.Now with the downsides. The  plastic case has a fragile silver finish which can be scratched too easily.  The camera consumes a lot of power, but life can be extended by keeping the  LCD off, although it is tempting not to. Finally, for a total extra cost of  $50, I would advise you to buy a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a  charger (NOT Olympus: too expensive) and an additional 16Mb+ smartmedia  card (also usable of Rio and other MP3 players).","Date":"June 2, 2000"}

{"Title":"Don't wait... Buy it now!","Author":"\"mattz\"","ReviewID":"R3234E4H1RAZT","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an excellent camera!  The image quality is astonishing for a product of this price range and the generated files are small, ideal for the web or e-mail. You can apply lots of zoom without pixelation. It's very easy to use. The manual is comprehensive and user-friendly. Buy a  protective case, because the camera doesn't include one and is fragile. You  can carry the SmartMedia cards in it, too. It's worth the money. We have  two of this toys (my father's and mine) and we are very pleased. Don't  forget that Olympus is an excellent brand. The bundled software is fine for  most purposes, but if you want more tweaking on the images, you can use  Corel, PhotoShop, etc. The ideal complement for this camera is a 16 Mb.  SmartMedia card. Don't rush buying it (the memory card) because the prices  are very unstable ... My advice: compare before  you buy. You don't need to buy Olympus-brand memory cards. They are  expensive (Look for other brands like SanDisk), and the only advantage that  they have over the generic cards is the Panorama function (the ability to  take 3 or 4 photos and link them) The camera price is very stable, online  or at a retail store. Consider buying a battery charger, because if you use  the screen too much to take photos, it will drain the batteries quickly.  (Use instead the optical viewer to take photos and the LCD screen to review  them). I have a Kodak charger with NiMH batteries and it works really nice.  Don't use alkaline batteries, because they don't last for long. If you buy  the D360L at some stores, you will be offered with a 4-year full-protection  program. It's worth considering. We are really happy with the camera. One  drawback: The downloading time is long via serial port, specially if you  have a big SmartMedia card with many images. If you are in a rush, buy an  USB adapter. For me, the speed is ok!","Date":"June 12, 2000"}

Thought enough of  the camera to purchase one (D-360L) for one son and will buy another for  the other son.  Just came back from a 2 week stay in Hawaii where I took  the 340R and my Canon A1 as a back up.  Took 350 pictures with the D-340R  and did not take the A1 out of the bag.  Have all the Hawaiian pictures on  a zip disk.  Pictures are easy to download.  Bought rechargable batteries  and three extra Smartmedia chips.

{"Title":"Highly Recommended, but not yet 35 mm","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RDL96Q78EYMHE","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought the camera a couple of months ago, as we wanted a camera that our 9  year old son could use to learn to take pictures, and we were wincing at  the $7-10/roll cost of 35 mm film, including developing.  Very good camera,  with some limitationsPros:  - Excellent images within the 1.3  Megpixel limits  - Very good sensitivity in dark/ shadowed areas -- but  contrast can swamp subtle shadings.  - Easy to use for most settings.  I had it up and taking pictures within about 5 minutes, although figuring  out all the bells& whistles took a while.  Panoramic pictures are very  nice, although you have to be careful in how you compose the set of  pictures to get good splicing in the computer.  - Camedia software is  pretty good, although there are better image processing software available.  - Downloading is easy although somewhat slow with the serial  connection.Cons  - Eats batteries.  Buy some rechargable NiMH  batteries and a charger on your way home from the store.  I keep a set  charged at all times and swap them out every time I take the camera out.  Works great that way.  Very very seldom run out of power when using the  camera.  LCD works very well, but will drain your batteries.  -  Viewfinder does *NOT* show accurate depiction of what the image to be  captured.  Use the LCD for proper image composition (but doesn't work in  direct sunlight), or be willing to crop the pictures on the computer  -  At low light levels is very sensitive to movement and blurring of images  (not unexpected).  - It's not 35 mm resolution;  there are limits on  enlarging pictures before running into pixel limitations.  For point and  shoot though, it's great.  - 2x digital zoom is a feature of very  limited usage. Figure you're buying a camera without zoom, and you won't  come in with adverse expectations.  Almost never used.Tips &  Comments  - We're getting almost 35 mm photo quality outputs from a HP  Inkjet printer (PSC 500) and HP premium photo paper.  The pictures look  good on white bond paper, but the difference with high quality photo paper  is amazing.  - We've only filled the 8 MB card a couple of times and  wished we could download the pictures to take more.  A few minutes editing  using the thumbnail display on the LCD can delete bad pictures and reduce  the number of images on the card to take more pictures.  We do download the  camera every night and clean the images off the card.  - Our breakeven  was an estimated 30 rolls of film -- if we used the camera more than 1000  images we would have found it worth it.  We took 400+ pictures alone on a  cruise to Alaska, and then listened to a friend complain about the $150  developing cost they had from their 35 mm film rolls.  - We had the  policy of not taking \"scenery\" shots with the 35 mm since we  didn't want to waste money taking pictures without a person in the picture.  With the digital camera we just take pictures.  The change in attitude to  taking pictures is striking.  We find the marginal cost per picture is near  zero -- unless you print them out.  That cost is around $0.10-0.25 per 1/4  page picture.Overall  - Very happy with this camera, once we've  learned its foibles.  Its not perfect, but very good.  When we're going out  on a family outing, we now just slip the camera in a pocket and take it  along.  We take 10x as many pictures due to the simplicity of digital  imaging and the quality of this camera.  - We highly recommend it.","Date":"September 6, 2000"}

In testing the camera, I choose the worst  scenario: me facing the sun taking a picture of a person.  The sun was  setting, putting it just of the subjects shoulder.  With the camera set on  automatic, the result was very acceptable. Face was recognizable.  It was  almost \"arty\" because of the suns rays. The next test was in  extremely low light.  The results were great.  A little washed out on close  subjects as you would expect, but overall picture quality was very, very  good. This is a great point and shoot camera with enough variable settings  to provide some great shots for someone who wants to experiment with low  light, action, sequences, etc. Downloading was a snap.

If you are going to turn on the LCD monitor and stare at photos every five minutes then it is going to eat batteries. First of all, get an Energizer ACCU rechargable for NiMH AA batteries. Do NOT get NiCads!  If you don't overwork the LCD monitor, batteries are NOT a problem. I took about 40-42 HQ (1280x960)shots on one fully charged set of NiMH's. About fifteen of those were with flash. I took my new toy to London where my charger would not work so I took a bunch AA Alkelines as back up. They are still in the unopened package. I highly recommend the purchase of a FlashPath Floppy Disk Adaptor...  It was shipped the next day. They include an 8mb smartmedia card which is good for another 36 HQ shots. An 8mb card comes with the camera. The only difficulty I had was taking panorama shots in bright sunlight.  It is difficult to see the monitor but would have been better had I turned up the brightness to \"high\". The 360L has lots of nice features that I had not even known about.

{"Title":"TERRIFIC PRODUCT - NO regrets","Author":"Suzanne","ReviewID":"R1EOV909LKETG2","Overall":"good","Content":"WONDERFUL product. Selection of this camera was not arbitrary - I spent a LOT of time researching and reading reviews of different cameras before deciding on this one.  I think my satisfaction was GREATLY increased by  purchase of 2 additional things: a card reader (I bought a Lexar USB ...  USB is worth the extra cost) and a 16MB card). I've never used the cable to  upload photos.  The reader uploads to computer are a no-brainer snap, you  can even move the photos via Windows Explorer if you don't want to use the  software that comes with the camera.  Battery time is very good based on  recent experience.  I was in Belgium for a week and never had to change  batteries.  Bear in mind that's by using the card reader for uploads and  without using the AC adapter! Good manual comes with the camera. I'm still  learning the icons on the readout, but that's a very minor thing for me.  I  use the camera for website photos and for insertion into PowerPoint  presentations.  It's superb for both.  I have no regrets and am  exceptionally pleased with the product.  It's a wonderful product for the  price. If you're on a tight budget, don't get the AC adapter until you see  if you really need it, but the card reader is really worth the money  (particularly after reading reviews by those who use the cable transfer).","Date":"July 9, 2000"}

Only $300 and it does everything a normal person would want.  It's a sturdy camera you can take everywhere.  Digital photography is  great.  Download to you PC quickly.  I started uploading my pics to a site  called [...] where you can share pics with friends and order kodak  prints of the digital images and they look just like regular film prints.One thing you MUST DO though, is buy 4 doubleA rechargable batteries for  it.  That will usually run you about $20, but it's worth it.  The digital  cam's viewer and flash can kill your batteries in one day of heavy use.Perfect starter digital cam.  But, for me, it's all I'm gonna need for a  few years.

{"Title":"Excellent Digicam","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2IENA6JAHBFKD","Overall":"good","Content":"I did a lot of research on lower cost digicams (<$400) and decided on the 360L since it was the update to the overwhelming popular 340R, and am more than happy with it(was considering the Fuji mx1200 too). The pictures  are of great quality & the features are very useful. Multiple settings  for ISO, flash, spot are great, and if you rather point & shoot it does  a great job there too! Extras such as the autofiring action mode (takes  rapid shots, one every half a second for up to 10 secs) are good for casual  fun as well. The software suits its purpose. I agree the battery life is  not the best, but all digicams will drain AA's very quickly, I invested in  Ni-metal rechargeables and seem to be doing fine with those. So far I've  been using the serial port download, it's fairly slow, but I can live  instead of shelling out for a USB adaptor. 8MB can fit lots of standard  quality, but I really preferred the super-high quality shots where you'll  only be able to squeeze 18 shots onto the 8 MB smart media.","Date":"March 30, 2000"}

{"Title":"Good pictures, Good size, Great memory, Battery hog!","Author":"J \"tech head dc\"","ReviewID":"RBAGJL4Y6GRG5","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, buy several rechargeable batteries when you get this camera! As  soon as I got mine, we played around with it off-n-on for no more than 3 or  4 hours before the brand-new alkaline batteries were useless. Flashes and  the built-in monitor really suck 'em dry.Now, besides that, the Olympus  D-360L is my first digital camera. Now I'm not really great at taking  pictures, so I put most of the settings on \"auto\" and hope that I  can Photoshop them into looking better later on. The picture quality is  good overall, but if you want any sort of details captured, you'll have to  use the largest pixel size available, and zoom in, too. So forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from 25 rows back. Most of my work  is on the internet, so it's great for web publishing, but I doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out -- but I haven't  really tried yet, either.The compact design is quite good, so I can't  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week. I  know I've carried mine around in my rough-n-tumble book bag for weeks on  end, and it hardly has a scratch on it. If you want to change the camera's  settings, there's a lot of button pushing to change the shutter,  white-balance, and image file size options. My friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes, or to  zoom in, or to take the picture over again because I flashed when I didn't  want to. And there's a slight delay between when I've pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic. \"Capturing the moment\" often takes  a couple mintues to prepare. Also, the pictures I've taken often look  fantastic on the LCD monitor, but are fuzzy when I download  them.Downloading is a snap ... sort of. Just install the software once,  then hook the cable up to your serial port and ... wait. It takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures. Heck, it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor. The editing software included is  okay, but it's no Photoshop.The very first weekend I had it, I went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze. Surprisingly, most of the photos came out great -- very  fun and colorful -- except when the flash goes off, people often have red  eye (which is fixable through adjustments) or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts. And if I didn't use the  flash, then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light. It definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the fly.In comparison, though, for  the price you pay here, you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device. The low-light photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black. I haven't yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose; it always seems to automatically compensate.  Also, the multi-photo \"panoramic\" option and the \"action  sequence\" modes are fun to play with, but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run. On one 8mb card, you can fit about 16 big  files, but tons of little photos. And remember, rechargeables,  rechargeables, rechargeables!","Date":"September 7, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great entry-level digital camera, but room for improvement!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2RXNXKN7UMLPB","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera as a gift for a friend, and it's great for taking casual, everyday pictures.  It's versatile and easy to use, with fairly good picture quality.  Initially I thought the 8MB SmartMedia card was a  bit on the small side, but it's a fair amount of storage space.  But since  I'm used to 35mm, I think there are a few shortcomings:  First, the CCD is  weak in the blue channel.  This means that reds and greens are accurately  recorded but there's a lot of graininess/noise in the blues.  This is a  common problem in all CCD-based devices, including scanners, and when  determining imaging quality, the blue channel is very revealing.  Under  most circumstances, though, you get an acceptable image.  Second, the user  interface is a little clumsy; you have to close the cover to review images.  The buttons do different things in different modes, and sometimes it's  hard to remember which is which.  Finally, I think it should've come with a  USB cable as well as a 9-pin serial.  (The HP line of cameras include a USB  cable for faster upload.)

We were definitely not disappointed.The D-360L was  the next step up from the D-340R. Then and today you cannot find a better  quality camera at this price, outside of the Olympus family.  The 360 has  all the same features of the 340-R, but adds capabilities to adjust white  balance, and tinker with spot metering, ISO and exposure settings.  It also  adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen, as well as  multiple flash and file compression settings.If you want additional zoom  power you'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $100 more.  It  adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview  screen.  If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try  looking for a D-340R.  They are still around at onine shops andit is a  great camera on the cheap!  All three of the camera have the same lens,  megapixel size etc.Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days  owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and  Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home. The camera  performed marvelously. We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more  than adequate for our needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into  our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? The 360 will  use up to a 32MB smart media card, enough for 400+ shots at low resolution.","Date":"September 5, 2000"}

{"Title":"It is a nice one at this price, but...","Author":"Sheng YANG","ReviewID":"R1YA77MMY6FXEP","Overall":"good","Content":"I read all reviews here and then  bought one from Amazon.com and took many photos using this camera. I thought the picture quality is very nice. But one important function is missing: after I download the photo images to my  PC using the CAMEDIA Master 1.2 software, I found that the date can not be  imprinted automatically on the right down corner of each picture. I read  carefully the camera manual and the software help documents, but no any  answer there, so I called the Olympus tech support hot line (1-8885534448).  the person there told me both the camera and the software can not  automatically add the date on a picture,  but if I buy a speicific Olympus  printer for printing, the date can be there,  or I can manually insert a  text box on each picture, I tried but the effect is bad because  the date  font is not quartz font so it does not like a phote picture. if any body  knows how to solve this problem, pls let us know. BTW, I think this  function should be very easily realized in a digital camera, but I am  really wondering why the Olympus company does not include it in this model.","Date":"May 2, 2000"}

{"Title":"Tens of thousands of pictures and still going strong!","Author":"Sean Cowen \"Sean Cowen\"","ReviewID":"RRWAD03FRRCR3","Overall":"good","Content":"We are an EBAY Powerseller bookstore and I have run our auctions for two years. I have taken thousands of pictures EACH WEEK with this camera and it is a true workhorse. It is my personal camera as well. So I tend to hook-up and unhook-up this camera daily - and I've experienced zero problems.I download pictures at a high speed using a ZIO card reader and it's always flawless. I use an iMac at home and a normal PC at work - and it works great with both. I use a 64mb Viking Components SmartMedia card and it can hold 292 high quality, under 350k pictures. We actually have a different company's 5.0 mp camera at work - and it is imposible to learn and use. We gave up. But you can learn this camera in under a minute and you'll be taking great pictures instantly. We're on eBay under the seller name bookman21century - see for yourself.This camera has been dropped numerous times, kicked around, loaded and unloaded daily - it has literally gone through the fires of Mt. Doom - and yet is still performs brilliantly. Sure the battery life is poor, but we use a power cord at work at that works great. And sure these newer cameras have many more mega-pixels - but this camera at 1.3 has worked so fine that it's all we need, or will need, for our home and business. So, I'd recommend this for any high-volume auction user. You open the shutter, aim, and press the button. I will always, always, always stick to Olympus for its ease of use, its durable quality, its toughness, and its adaptability. If you are taking 10,000 or 100,000 pictures - this workhorse is more than up to the task!","Date":"November 15, 2003"}

It's  almost impossible to take a bad photo with it, and it's great not having to  wait for a photo-processing lab before seeing the photos.I'm an American  currently living and working in London, England. I bought an Olympus  Camedia D-360L before I left home, and I've been sending photos of my  adventures along with a daily email newsletter to my friends, family, and  co-workers back at the US office.Nearly everyone has commented on the  clarity and sharpness of the photo attachments, and at work, the number of  subscribers to my Daily UK Newsletter list has swelled.I just love this  camera!!!! It's small enough to slip in a jacket pocket and take  sightseeing, and the photo editing software features help turn even  mediocre shots into good photos.My only criticism is that the included  Camedia photo-editing software is pretty unstable on Windows 98. I'm  running a laptop with 96 MB of memory, and find that the Camedia program  crashes frequently while using the Rotate and Filter->Brightness  features, leaving an alert dialog that won't go away unless I reboot.","Date":"August 8, 2000"}

First, it eat batteries, forcing you to ...rechargeable bateries and a adapter for use when downloading images. 2nd, the camera has no optical zoom, forcing you to use the digital (and the LCD screen which drains batteries.) My third gripe about the camera is that the button for the LCD screen is resecced so it won't get turned on accidentaly, but the button makes it very, very, very dificult to turn on. I reapeatadly find my self stuggling to turn on the LCD screen. My 4th and final gripe is that it has no USB connection with the package. With the serial connection, it can take me 3 or 4 hours to donwload 20 or so pictures. I would suggest buying a memory card reader....

I have even received reasonable battery life by using the view finder exclusively.  A major problem was downloading via the serial port on my PC.  I have the Palm V software on board and the Palm V synchronization software kicks in whenever the PC is turned on.  This in turn made it impossible for the computer to find the camera and download pictures. The solution was very simple but was not to be found in any printed matter available from Olympus or Palm.  I found the solution in an \"oh by the way\" comment in a product review magazine.  Simply select from the Palm synchro menu the option that requires synchronization to be manually activated.

I looked at the new top-of-the-line \"prosumer\" models (Canon G1, Nikon 990, etc.) and came to the conclusion that they had a lot of features I would never use.

I get a good 8 x 10 print at this setting.Another thing I bought is a Sandisk external USB Smartcard reader (about $50). Downloading photos from the camera using the serial port is very slow, and eats up batteris.

Looking through the stores I was dismayed at how high prices for a decent digital camera were, but then I found this one online and WOW, was it worth the price.  I was truly astounded by the quality of the pictures it took, and especially the  compression - I had guess that the included 8 MB cartridge would hold about  20 pictures, but it actually holds 36 HiRes photos! If you buy a 32 MB  cartridge to go along with it (as did I), then you can hold a whopping 180  pics total - plus the ability to delete the ones you don't want as you go  means those 180 last even longer.  The only qualm I had with this camera  was the batteries. After one day of use, they were running low.

{"Title":"This Camera is a Winner!","Author":"Mary","ReviewID":"RVQ2CVEP20YJ6","Overall":"good","Content":"When one is considering an important purchase like this one, \"ease of use\" comes to mind.  After much research through the internet,  newspaper and magazines, I found only the Olympus D-360L meets the  \"ease of use\" criteria.  First, the camera itself is small enough  to fit into one's pocketbook or a small bag making it easy to carry.  Second, the many picture-quality settings are good for amateur  photographers looking for the perfect shot or the more skilled photographer  with specific shots in mind.  Third, the LCD Monitor is useful not only for  taking wide panorama shots, but serves as a viewer to delete unwanted  pictures.  Lastly, uploading pictures into the Camedia software is simple.  Just plug the 9-prong cable from the back of the PC into the camera, turn  the camera on and click on the my camera icon in the software and voila!  the pictures are ready to view.  The software also lets you size, enhance  and remove red-eye from photos.  When you are through adjusting your  photos, you can save them to your favorite file or print them.  With the  push of a button through the software or the camera itself, the original  picture can be discarded.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.  Olympus is known for quality products and it hits that mark again.","Date":"August 7, 2000"}
{"Title":"my first digicam","Author":"Sci-Boy","ReviewID":"RU8XAJXIXQ6YK","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought mine just before summer 2000, and I haven't used my old 35 mm since then.  I immediately purchased a 16 MB smart media card and 4xAA NiMH w/ charger.  Downloading pix via the RS232 cable averaged about 30 s each -- painfully slow for a full memory card.  An internal card reader helped out a great deal when I upgraded to a new PC.Image quality is good but not great, as I always have to tweak colors with PhotoShop.  You can squeeze out decent 5x7's from the pix if you set up your shots right (can't crop them or you'll lose too much resolution); 4x6's are no problem.There's a bit of a learning curve to the menu, but since it's digital photography, you can practice lots and delete what you don't want.  I use mine constantly, and I even try to fill up both of my memory cards whenever I'm at a family gathering or camping or whatever holiday.Finally, I take all my pix at the highest JPG setting and ignore the lower resolutions; sort of a waste of time to get 1000 pix if you don't have any detail.","Date":"December 9, 2004"}

{"Title":"A review from a Macintosh user","Author":"Shelley Gammon \"Geek\"","ReviewID":"R1TTEOU4GBATAI","Overall":"bad","Content":"Our IT vendor ordered this for  me 3 years ago (yes, the camera has been out that long... makes you think, doesn't it) when I told him I didn't know anything, but I needed a digital camera in a hurry.Having been new to the world of digital cameras at the time, I was easily impressed when I opened the package. They advertise the camera as being Mac compatible via a serial port.Well, Macs haven't shipped with serial ports for YEARS. Why not USB?!I had to buy a [price] adapter by Belkin (about the only one in existance that would connect this camera to my G3 at the time). The images download SLOOOOOOOW via a serial port. USB is a much faster architecture. Of course, firewire is 100 times faster than USB, but since Windows hasn't caught up to the technical advances of Mac yet, USB would have been sufficient for a cross-platform market.When you're using Olympus's proprietary software to download the images from your camera, you can't do anything else... it does not function in the background. Very sloppy programming... no need for such a simple process to take up so much of the system heap.The camera uses 4 (four) AA batteries, which add to the weight of the camera significantly. If you use the LED screen in the back of the camera, prepare to carry an additional 12 AA batteries with you for a day-long shoot, because you're going to be changing batteries at least 3 times in order to shoot a single day on a vacation... this camera eats batteries for breakfast.This also  applies if you use the flash. There is very little warning that the batteries are low... when there is almost no juice left, a pitiful battery icon will flash briefly in the view finder and then that's it.  This camera does not use rechargable batteries....About 8 months after owning this camera, I started noticing a delay in response time. I'd click on the shutter release and a full second and a half would pass before the picture would be taken. This is too much of a delay! The picture should take immediately... just like it does on a 1955 Brownie Hawkeye. If I'm trying to shoot an action shot or an animal or a child, every split second matters... when I click, the picture should be taken immediately, not a week later. Fresh batteries don't make a difference in the delay.The camera does take some half-way decent 640x480 JPEG shots, but the camera is slow in writing them to disk, which means you can't take the photos quickly in succession.  You also can't delete a bad shot on the camera, so even if a shot is awful, you're stuck with it until you load the disk into the computer to delete the shot... which means you have to wait for the ENTIRE roll of shots to load into the program and download in order to even delete them.There are some great bargains to be had in the computer world.... This is not the case with digital cameras. You truly get what you pay for. After being exposed to some very nice digital still cameras and digital camcorders, I can confidently say that this little Olympus is one of the worst I've ever used, and should definitely be a last choice for anyone using a Macintosh.","Date":"January 24, 2002"}

It takes suprisingly good pictures.  It helps to understand the weaknesses of digital photography when using any digital camera.  Digital cameras will not give great rendition in low light situations.  In fact low light settings are often best handled without using the flash to avoid adding contrast to the photo.  I've seen a number of reviews where users complained about low lighting performance using the flash.  This may indicate a lack of digital camera experience.  The average in camera flash is only good within 8 feet.  This is very critical with digitals because shadow areas are digitals weak point.  Other than that caution you'll find this camera allows you to easily take great pictures.  I've often been surprised at how good the photos come out, even with this small number of pixels.  I've printed all types of photos from this camera up to 8x10 (not a recommended size).  It easily produces very good 3x5, 4x6 and 5x7 prints.

As others have said, though, it does eat batteries!  A charger, and two sets of metal hydride rechargeable batteries, are well worth the investment, as one set of them will last about 100 pics worth.

The great price let me afford  a few accessories such as another ram chip and rechargeable batteries ---  got it all out the door for [a great price].

{"Title":"The Olympus D-360L is a Direct Hit! Excellent!","Author":"Terrance Shaw","ReviewID":"R3DNYXPLLTE8Q1","Overall":"good","Content":"Alright, I've got to say... this is perhaps the best camera that I've ever owned. A major step up from my first digital camera (a Mustek VDC-3500-which I'd highly recommend against), and even better than my Sony DCR-TRV130 Digital8 Camcorder (which isn't focused on taking photographs anyway), the Olympus D-360L is a dream come true. From the 1.8\" LCD screen to the sixty-four (64) megabyte (no, that's not a typo; the D-360L that I bought came packaged with a 64Mb SmartMedia chip in addition to the 8Mb chip packaged originally with the camera ... The photo quality of images taken with the camera is hardly anything to scoff at, and if you've got advanced image-editing software (i.e., Adobe Photoshop), then you can make an excellent image look even better!The only downside that I've managed to find to the camera, is the same problem that countless others have pointed out: the low battery life. But, as people have recommended, this problem can be overcome with nothing more than either a large pack of AA batteries, or just by buying a dozen or so rechargeable batteries and switching out between them. There are additional quirks that I've got against the camera, but nothing that can't be overcome by spending a couple dollars or so. First, it's the fact that the D-360L camera uses a serial connection for uploading images to your computer. This means that you're in for somewhat of a wait, unless you buy a SmartMedia memory reader. But no worries! You can buy an extremely affordable SmartMedia reader ...for [very little]! ... When I plugged the SmartMedia reader into my computer, it immediately picked up on what it was, and installed the drivers automatically, without any necessary disc (although a drivers disc does come with the reader), as I'm running the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. But what I found to be the most interesting thing about the reader is this: it doesn't transfer the images through a TWAIN interface, but instead, shows up as a drive in My Computer, where you can just copy, paste, and delete the file(s) right there! Now isn't that convenient?As a matter of fact, if you're a Mac user, I'd really recommend that you purchase a SmartMedia reader, because it's only an added twenty dollars, and the investment is well worth it in the long run. ... In addition to rechargeable batteries and the SmartMedia reader though, I'd recommend that you also purchase an AC adapter for the camera to save battery-life while you're transferring the images (this is of course, unnecessary if you purchase a SmartMedia reader).All in all, I'd say that the Olympus D-360L digital camera was the best [money] that I've ever spent on a computer-related gadget, and I know that, if you can see past it's few (small) flaws, you'll really love this, as it's a great product, entrance level or not. My final verdict is five out of five for the camera, and I'd encourage EVERYONE to buy one of these.Here's a bit of an update (August 04, 2002).  Recently, I went on vacation with my dad to Philadelphia.  Well, I went to visit Hershey Park to check out the Dolphin show, starring Clovis and Wee Tee.  The show was excellent, albeit rather short?weighing in at fifteen minutes, plus fifteen minutes of sea lions.  In any event, I took a LOT of pictures while I was there, and I began to notice that the camera was a bit slow with taking the pictures.  It took around perhaps two to three seconds to process each image in high-quality mode.  Although it might not seem like a lot of time in between pictures, it's an aeon, when your subjects are fast-paced Dolphins!  However, even though there is this little problem that I have with it, my review still holds at five stars.","Date":"June 25, 2002"}

Finally, I gave in, and how glad I am that I did. It has been a real winner in terms of ease of use and quality of pictures. Many look like a professional photographer took and developed them. For those who want great pictures and ease of use at a really bargain price, this is the camera for you. Most of us don't want pictures larger then 5 X 7, so why pay for more megapixels that you don't need? I also bought a 64 and a 128MB SmartCard, and have more than enough storage for vacations.

I love being able to take any and all pictures that I want, downloading to my pc, and erasing them from the disk in the camera.  It comes with an 8mb (allows 36 pics) camedia card but I did end up buying an additional 16mb (allows 72 pics)  because I just wanted an additional card in case of a big event.  The camera has probably already paid for itself because of all of the money saved in film development.  I love being able to immediately  e-mail pictures once they have been downloaded to the pc.

This camera gives a vertical green line in almost every picture which is very disturbing. I called up Olympus and asked for an exchange, but they refused to do that. Instead they said the green lines are because the batteries are left in the camera itself. They suggested to remove the batteries if camera is not in use.

{"Title":"Amazing camera for \"the price\", but some probs for Mac users","Author":"David W. Griffin","ReviewID":"R10MM8G7J8RIP3","Overall":"good","Content":"For image quality, I was quite amazed by the quality of the pictures produced by this camera. At high quality (JPEG) you can get 36 pictures on the 8MB card, and presumably, with  the 64MB card ... ... that wouldbe  288 pictures! With the LCD off, the battery usage isn't too badeither. I also find that the closeup pictures (the macro mode) is also quite good, though the flash is overpowering in these situations. I'll probably experiment with a flash diffuser, possibly something as simple as a piece of white paper over the flash in these cases.For Macs though, be prepared to work through a few problems. First of all, the cable that converts the PC serial connector to the Macintosh serial connector (for older macs like mine) isn't in the box, despite the label on the box which indicates that it's mac compatible. There's a coupon you can mail to get this connector free, but it should be in the box in my opinion. For modern macs, one would probably have to buy a USB smartmedia card reader.Knowing this however, I also bought the SanDisk FlashDisk  adapter that allows you to read smartmedia cards from your floppy disk drive (also gone in modern Macintosh computers). It too claimed to be mac compatible but it too lacked any actual support in the box. There was NO software for the mac. I had to download the drivers from the internet.Then I found the drivers claimed that OS8.6 was necessary (I was running OS 8.5.1). I was able to read single image files off the flashdisk, but not two or more. I installed 8.6 but found I had the same problem. I was subsequently able to download multiple files when I directed them to a subdirectory instead of the desktop. I can't say for sure that this alone was the cause of the problem, but at least the whole combination worked.8x10's are somewhat unsatisfying (of course) but 4x5's made with the camera are really good. It would probably make passable 5x7's. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Olympus lost a star for a somewhat complex user interface and no mac cable in the box.","Date":"February 19, 2001"}

I was a camera snob. Then had kids  and couldn't be bothered to lug around an SLR plus attachments. With the  excuse that I was buying it for my wife, I purchased one of the original  Olympus clamshell designs in 1992. Secretly I loved this little camera. Not  long after I sold the cherished Nikon. So it goes.But after 8 years, the  trusty Olympus was showing it's age. And the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times. So I was in search  of its replacement.I'm comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camera.I was intrigued  sufficiently to visit Wolf Camera and look at one.If a picture is worth  a thousand words, experiencing something must be worth at least  10,000.Unlike its 35mm cousins (Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera  comes to mind and is what I wound up buying) this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different company.It is large; won't  fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.It is heavy.It is square and  boxlike (none of the Stylus Epic's sensuous lines).If you are attracted  to one-shot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the web.","Date":"July 26, 2000"}

My criteria were picture quality, advanced features and a price under $500. After a week of  taking over a hundred pictures, I'm very impressed with both the crisp  quality and true to life colors of each picture. It automatically adjusts  to florescent, incandescent, and outdoor light. The selectable ISO settings  makes for very impressive low light pictures. The panorama stitching was  easy to use and very accurate. This will be great for taking seascapes  while on vacation. I'm still on my first set of batteries so battery life  is great. I read a lot of reviews on the D450 ZOOM before I purchased the  D460 and all the small things that owners complained about were fixed.  Olympus really must listen to customer feedback. The menus are easy to use,  it remembers settings when turned off, they even ship three manuals in each  language instead of one in three languages. I recommend picking up a USB  port SmartReader or Floppy adapter. Also get some NiMH batteries and a  charger. You're in for some great pictures with this camera.","Date":"April 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"Low price for the high quality, let me give a quality review","Author":"James E. Dimitroff","ReviewID":"R1993SG822IGIH","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been using this camera for about a month now.  I did extensive research on the internet for digital cameras $500 and under. The runners where Olympus 360L, Kodak 210, and Olympus D460Z.  And it is a very impressive camera overall.  The camera itself offers wide angle or zoom 3x shots.  It also offers a 3x cropping to bring it to 6x.  It's menu is very easy to use out of the box.  Has 2 menu modes, one with camera active, one when it's not active (setup mode.) It's auto focus is by holding the button halfway down for a sec, then clicking.  It's wide/zoom is a small lever next to shutter button for easy access.  You can use it's LCD or to save on batteries it's normal view frame for taking shots.  The smartmedia card and batteries easily installs/uninstalls.  If offers what they call a Paranormal mode which takes multiple pictures on one frame.  It offers a sequence mode that lets you take 10 pictures back to back with for a series shot.  You will need to format your SmartMedia card if it's not from Olympus, but it's fast and easy to do.  My only gripes are when closing the lens cover, you have to be careful and let the lens retrack first, so you just close it a little, then the rest of the way after lens is back in.  The flash flips up, and seems a little clumsey there, but it works fine.  You will need to purchase more than just this camera when you buy it.  What it comes with is: 2 lithium batteries, a hand strape, an 8meg smart media card.  And what else you need would be: a carrying case (est $30), a bigger smart media card (I got a 64meg est $60), NiMH Batteries w/charger(they aren't cheap but worth it est $110), a smart media reader (est $40), and maybe the power adaptor (est $60).  With a 64meg card I get 36 shots in sqhq mode.  And with my NiMH batteries, after one month of use, I still haven't had to replace them.  Normal alkline recharables last maybe 30-40 shots, the NiMH last more like 300-400 shots.  I use the lithium that came with it for backup batteries and place them in my case with 8meg memory card.  A SmartMedia reader is a must for getting the pictures to your computer.  Otherwise you will have to use the serial connection to the camera and very slowly d/l the pics.  Which means you'd have to have a power adaptor because it would drain your batteries.  With a media reader, it's like using a zip drive, and see the MediaSmart card as another drive, and you just drag and drop your pics to your drive, fast, simple, and very slick.  If you choose to purchase this camera, you will be more than pleased that you did.  But be aware, you will need to make a few more purchases in accessories to truely enjoy this camera.","Date":"September 29, 2000"}
{"Title":"The digital camera that made me take the plunge - finally","Author":"Larry J. Clark","ReviewID":"R3CGYYGL6BFLE0","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm primarily a 35mm and subminiature photographer and was waiting until digital resolution and price met at a nice point.  The D-460 did it for  me.First, a couple of warnings: 1) Batteries - Although Amazon lists 4  AA alkalines as the power source, don't count on it.  The two included  Olympus lithium batteries (which are each the same size as a pair of AAs)  are a special high output chemistry.  You will be VERY unhappy if you take  the camera to an event and only have one set of alkalines.  Digital cameras  use a lot of juice, especially when you download and when you use the LCD  screen.  The consumer problem is that the Olympus batteries (CR-V3, or p/n  LB-01E) are VERY hard to find.  I've not seen any in camera or electronics  stores, although you can purchase them for $14 ea directly from Olympus --  and Olympus says you should be able to buy them from several internet  vendors, but the only one on their list that even showed the batteries was  B&H, and they didn't have any in stock (@ $10 ea.).  The next best  thing is use rechageable NiMh cells.  You can spend a hunk of money and buy  the Olympus cell/recharger set, or can hunt around electronics stores and  buy something for about half the price -- make sure you get AA cells in the  1400 to 1500 mAh range. 2)  Price - The normal street price for this camera  is now $399. 3)  Downloading Photos - Although you can use the included  serial cable, you'll also use a lot more batteries.  If you have a USB port  on your computer, you should consider getting getting a SmartMedia external  drive.  They're inexpensive and fast and easy to use.But to the good  stuff.  Side-by-side tests against my office's Sony Mavica's give the  Olympus the edge at the same 640 x 480 resolution.  When you go to the  higher 1280 x 960 resolution, I think you'll be pleased with the results.  The optical finder makes it much easier to take snapshots, especially in  bright sunlight, where LCD only cameras leave you wondering what you're  shooting at.  The 3:1 zoom ratio is comfortable, and you can do accurate  closeups using the LCD screen for a viewfinder.  If you go ahead and buy  the SmartMedia external drive, you should consider getting an additional  8MB (one comes with the camera) or 16MB card.I think that for many  applications, including some professional use, you will find this to be a  good performing camera at a good price.  (The only reason I gave it a  4-star rating is because of the so-so availability of the lithium  batteries, and the fact that it took a little more digging than expected to  figure out what was really going on with those things.)","Date":"August 6, 2000"}

I bought this baby, and boy am I glad I did.  The pictures are remarkable, even when printed 8x10 on my printer (nothing fancy, just an HP 712C.)  I get better detail on closeups than I do using my SLR camera.  Pictures turn out great even in very low light.  Plus, if you pick up a set of rechargable batteries, this guy is practially free to use.  No more spending dough on film or developing.  I highly recomend this camera for anyone looking to jump into digital pictures.  It's well worth the money and will save you a bundle.","Date":"November 27, 2000"}
{"Title":"A Definite Winner-- BUY this camera!","Author":"Baltic Books \"Vic\"","ReviewID":"R21E3C7NTV7B0J","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading every review we could find, last year we ventured for the  first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R  digital camera. We were definitely not disappointed.  The D460 is this  year's model improving the 340-R by adding a 3x optical zoom in addition to  the 2x digital zoom. For the price you will not match the features and  quality of this camera.After just a few days the camera accompanied us  to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our  Canon SLR at home. The camera performed marvelously. We found the optional  16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs, as we easily  downloaded photos each day into our laptop. An 8MB card comes  standard.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? You can  purchase up to a 32MB smart media card which will give you more than 400  shots at 800x600!","Date":"September 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"The Olympus 460 is a good point and shoot camera.","Author":"podavis","ReviewID":"R30DOK9RY5YBXC","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the 460 because I wanted a digital camera that I could stick in my pocket but one that I could also expect to take respectable pictures.  On the first count, with the built in lense shield, the camera is easy to  'bring along'.My expectations have been generally exceeded on the second  count. The camera was purchased in time to document a fantastic mixture of  daffodils at their peak.  The camera's macro mode produces stunning  pictures, the detail and contrast of a bloom that fills the frame is  beautiful.  My guess was and is that the apparent price premium for this  camera goes towards premium optics that only a company like Olympus knows  how to engineer.Color rendition is equally impressive, only flesh tones  under flash seem to be a bit off, and fortunately in the warm direction.  Otherwise, my expectations have been exceeded, it's comparable to 35mm  negative film. And I haven't noticed any significant distortions  either.My comparison shopping indicated that the flashes of all cameras  in this range have a 13 foot range.  I was hoping that the capability to  quadruple the effective ISO to 500 would extend the usable range to 26  feet.  So far, after 250 pictures, I have found the noise in a picture  taken at ISO 500 renders low quality pictures.  I haven't experimented much  with ISO 250.The camera seems to be slow to focus, or I'm too impatient,  one must wait for the green light in the view finder to confirm focus has  been found or fuzzy pictures result.  But this is no SLR, it's a point and  shoot concept and one that, given good lighting, takes fantastic pictures.  I printed a still life on a Textronix Phaser wax printer at 8x10 and was  amazed that I got a frameable picture. I didn't expect this it at only  1.3Meg pixels!By the way, it runs just fine on AA NiMH batteries from  Target or Radio Shack.","Date":"May 12, 2000"}

I decide on this one because I had owned the similarly styled 35 mm and loved it.I like the fact that there is no lens cap to loose,  but the lens is still protected.  I use it to take promo pictures of bands,  so the location can be a bit hostile (bars and nightclubs) and I wanted  something that I felt was at least somewhat protected.I was more than  thrilled when I uploaded my pictures to a site to have 35mm quality prints  made and found that I could get exceptional 8x10 pics from just the middle  setting of the quality choices. But even in the lowest setting the pictures  are great for website postings.I bought a 16mg card to go with it and I  got 3 complete shows worth of pictures and with the Flashpath adapter, the  websites are getting updated faster than ever.I also bought 2 sets of  rechargeable batteries and have found that I can get a whole weekend of  shows (12-15 hours)on them even using the LCD panel and it's still cheaper  than buying disposable.","Date":"May 31, 2000"}

I really liked the way that the camera looked and was anxious to have one. Then I did a little research. I found out that Sony has there cameras made by an outside manufacturer. sony also does not share their technology with other manufacturers so if you want to accesorize, then you have to pay the inflated prices for \"genuine Sony parts\". Olympus has been in the camera biz for years. So I asked myself why am I going to buy a product from a company that doesn't really specialize in cameras? It is also good to know that there is only one kind of storage media that you can use with the Sony Cybershots. Conviently, Sony has also jacked the price on there \"Memory Sticks\" because it's the only thing that you can buy for it. The Olympus D460 does every thing that the Cybershot does, save for the swivel LCD display. The Olympus also uses smart card media, so you can be a little more selective in what can fit your budget. Speaking of budgets, I saved about $120.00, and still feel that I got a better camera that what Sony could ever offer. If you like affordability, convenience, and a simple camera, the Olympus D460 is the camera for you. If you like to pay for a name, then buy a SONY!","Date":"November 20, 2000"}

I originally was going to buy the 360, but I figured if I was going to spend the money for a digital camera, I might as well get the zoom.With the 460 comes some advanced photography features like spot metering, fill-in flash, etc.  Those features may seem useless to amateur photographers, but if you take  the time to learn the features, you'll end up with better pictures.  The  TV wire is pretty cool, and even the pictures with the lowest quality look  pretty good on TV.  The LCD screen on the camera is very sharp and has  amazing color.  I just wish there was some way to cover the screen to  protect it better.  A downside to the Olympus is that it doesn't come  with a lot of accessories.  I'm going to have to buy stuff like a camera  case, battery recharger, USB adapter, and a 32 MB card.  ....","Date":"June 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Superior Camera for the price","Author":"Alan K. Jeppesen \"Jepp in Tooele\"","ReviewID":"R2FKF8JE3FRC50","Overall":"good","Content":"The D460Zoom is my second Olympus Digital Camera.  My first was the D360, which was a great camera until a child put the batteries in wrong and burned it up!  I cannot say enough good things about the D460Zoom...It writes the files quickly allowing follow-up shots in 2-3 seconds. It has easily understood controls, and takes better quality photos than most digital cameras I have seen -- including my brother's large and bulky Sony.  The autofocus and zoom both work without hitch and allow a considerable amount of leaway in composing your shots.  One of the things I find especially exciting is its ability to adopt to difficult lighting situations.  You can take pictures in very difficult bright and dark shadow conditions and get excellently exposed results.  I am comfortable taking pictures in any lighting situation, indoors or out.While there is some media that hold more pictures than the smart media cards, the smart media cards are very small and easy to use.  I bought a card reader [and] it is as easy to down load pics as to read a disk--faster even.  For the money, this camera is as good or better than many costing twice as much.","Date":"October 23, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent Camera but Maybe One Problem","Author":"wcc2","ReviewID":"RX76QA33CZXSV","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall I really like my D460, but having owned it now for half a year it has one weakness: the lengthy delay between taking consecutive photos. In the medium density \"HQ\" mode, each photo takes about 2-3 seconds to write to the SmartMedia memory card. This delay can be infuriating. When photographing evolving action, sometimes I take a photo too early - the action gets more interesting and I want to take another shot. But if it is within 2-3 seconds of taking a prior shot, the D460 can't help you. Press away at the shutter button all you want (even with the flash totally off). It is not listening.Frankly, most of the time this is not a problem. But this delay bother me so much that I went out and also bought the Olympus D490 Zoom, which is almost identical to the D460 but adds a RAM memory buffer. Delay between shots is almost zero. Shoot as fast as you want. Another advantage, having tested both of my cameras side-by-side, is that the D490 \"boots-up\" more quickly and therefore is ready to use just a fraction sooner. Instead of buying two cameras like me, maybe check out the D490 as well. Currently it is... more than the D460, and maybe worth it.Otherwise, the D460 has been a work-horse. I've shot about 1,000 images and surprisingly the TFT LCD display on the back of the camera has turned out to be quite scratch-resistant. After 6 months and a trip to Italy, it looks just as pristine as the LCD display on my new D490. Both fine cameras (though wish I owned only one).","Date":"September 27, 2000"}
{"Title":"D-360 vs. D-460Z","Author":"Robert Hastings","ReviewID":"R24Y1E59YZWTOX","Overall":"good","Content":"I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","Date":"June 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Pleasing Prints!","Author":"James T. Leyden","ReviewID":"R3VF1SCCSW9PYV","Overall":"good","Content":"Consideration #1 - Why did I choose the Olympus over other \"computer\" brands? Because the Olympus line of digital cameras in general beats out any other line of cameras out there as far as picture quality, and the D460 is no exception. It is always a rule of thumb to buy cameras from a real camera company, if only because the optics will always be top notch.  Once you have taken pictures with a computer brand camera, and seen the prints, then switched to an Olympus or Nikon etc... you will definitely see the difference in quality.Consideration #2 - Why did I choose the D460 over a Nikon?The main factors were price and battery life.  The Nikon cameras take to sucking your batteries dry given even moderate use of the LCD, whereas the 400 series of Olympus cameras are quite the road warriors when it comes to batteries.  Now remember that this camera does not come with rechargeable batteries (it includes high-powered NiMH one time use batts) you should plan on spending the extra $30-50 on a set of rechargeable and a charger.  Other Points of Consideration -Also plan on getting another smart media card if you are going to take more than a few pictures in one use, because the included card (8mb SmartMedia) only holds 16 SHQ quality pictures, (the format with the best compromise between space and quality) SHQ mode uses a JPEG compression to make file size smaller. Adding a 16MB smartmedia card will get you 32 pictures at that compression, and a 32mb card will get you 64 pictures, and so on...  Also remember that you can readily exchange between cards when one gets full, so you don't loose the functionality of that original 8mb card that comes with the camera if you get another one. You can just take it out when it's full and stick in your new one. (just keep them in their case, and don't loose the little things, because boy are they expensive!)Verdict -Overall, this a really a great buy and will serve you well while on vacation, or at your kid's soccer game.  If you want to make your pictures bigger than 8x10, however, you might want to upgrade to the D490. If not, have fun with this great camera!","Date":"October 20, 2000"}

I shopped around and got a good price on the D460 (less than $499) and am very, very happy. The  batteries have also lasted longer than I expected. I've taken pictures out  doors and indoors with and without flash. The flash has several settings,  much like a good SLR camera, but the camera can also adapt to low-light  without flash and keep the warm tones.A feature not often mentioned is  the fact that the camera includes a cable to hook it up to your TV and view  pictures at a large size, give a slide show to friends-- or even take  pictures while using the tv screen as a viewer. Surprisingly fun to do.I  followed another reviewer's recommendations and bought rechargeable AA NiMH  batteries and charger (the maha 1550s in a combo kit) at Thomas  Distributing for a good price. The Olympus tech support people told me just  to make sure you buy batteries with at least 1450 mAH--higher is better for  juicing those downloads. They do not recommend using any AC adapter other  than the olympus one because it might damage the camera (and I assume it  might violate your warranty), but other sources report that the one sold at  thomas distributing is fine. One more thing--if you buy another card, get  the Olympus brand if you intend to use the panorama feature--apparently  other cards don't support this.The only reason I give this camera 4 out  of 5 stars is that it doesn't connect to USB; the cable supports serial  ports and mac adb ports, but doesn't have a usb connection. This means you  have to buy a USB reader if you have a hot new computer, although you might  want to do this anyway.","Date":"July 14, 2000"}

The overall layout is great. 3) Picture quality is very  good. 4) 3X optical zoom is fairly powerful. 5) Many useful features, such  as panorama, date imprinting, manual ISO, varies of flash modes... 6) Comes  with 3 instruction booklets of 3 different languages so you don't need to  carry a thick manual for the part that you can't read. 7) Good overall  value, quality and features.Con: 1) Hard to tell if a photo has been  taken/captured because there's no clicking sound or other indications.  There are warning beeps and orange/green warning lights, but they come on  for many different reasons. 2) the flash light does not automatically pop  open when turn on the camera, so if there is not enough light, it's really  hard to tell if the picture has been taken. So the flash light has to be  manually pop open in order for it to be automatic. Manytimes I have to read  the picture count or \"write\" indication to be sure that a picture  is indeed captured. 3) The softwere that comes with the package has limited  features. 4) No AC adaptor comes with the package (I know, asking for  SmartMedia or UBS adaptor is really too much).Note: If you have software  for other serial devices installed, make sure you exit them (modem and  serial mouse have NO problem). For example, I have PalmPilot's HotSync  software installed, and it conflicts with this photo software (The warning  messages do not help at all as in all cases).

About 15 minutes after opening the box I already had a couple pictures taken and loaded onto my computer, this included software installation and everything!!  I love how you can see the pictures on the screen immediately after you take them, so you can see if they turned out or not.Just to address a few of the problems that I read in other reviews.  One person commented on how you get drained on the batteries.  The simple solution is to buy some rechargable NiMH batteries with a charger.  The NiMH batteries last a long time to start with anyways!!  Another problem that was addressed is that it can be tedious to find your pictures on the camera if you go through them one by one.  There is a setting on the camera so that you can put 9 thumbnails of the pictures on your screen at the same time, so finding your pictures really is not a problem!!I also recommend buying a USB Smartmedia Reader.  I believe I read that they are 80 times faster than using the connection provided with the camera.  Also, if you use the USB Smartmedia Reader, you do not need to waste the camera batteries while you load pics onto your computer, since the camera isn't even involved in the loading process if you use the USB Reader.Also, just as a side note, a 16 or 32 MB smartmedia card is nice if you plan on using the high quality settings.This really doesn't have to do with the camera, but if you plan on buying these extra add-ons, I really suggest using Ebay, you can get some great deals!!  I bought all the add-ons off from Ebay and spent about 100 dollars less than I would have elsewhere.To sum it all up, I think this camera is an excellent choice whether you have no idea how to use a digital camera (such as myself) or are a pro!  The controls are extremely easy to figure out with a tad of help from the instruction manual.  Also, for such a simple and easy to use camera, it takes excellent, clear, crisp, pictures, which really surprised me when I first saw them!  I highly recommend this camera!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is I think it should come standard with the USB reader, to save us consumers a little money.  Although not at all necessary, it still would be nice!!I hope this helps you all out on your digital camera purchase!!","Date":"March 23, 2001"}

Under the D450 reviews, several users recommend getting a flashpath floppy adapter and NiMH rechargable batteries  (these accessories are also compatible with the D460). In reading the  separate reviews for the Olympus brand products, several reviewer suggest  buying non-Olympus products since they are both less expensive and have  more features. The reviewers don't mention where to find these  products.If you are considering non-Olympus products, with your favorite  search engine... for the fastpath use \"flashpath and smartmedia\"  (since there are three types of flashpath standards, \"smartmedia\"  is what Olympus uses). For the NiMH batteries use \"MAHA MH-C204F\"  (the very informative battery review had accidentially transposed the last  two digits, which yields no hits).","Date":"April 19, 2000"}

It had been my number one choice all along, but after reading it's specs, it was like icing on the cake.  Now that I have it, I can take perfect pictures that look incredible and print witht the same quality as regular film.  I strongly recomend this camera to anyone.  Not only should you purchase this camera, but I also suggest an AC Adapter and rechargeable batteries.  Both are well worth the extra money.  I also purchased a carrying case, a 16 mb memory card, and a panorama lens, but you can get along without some of these. -brett","Date":"December 1, 2000"}
{"Title":"Good product, but could be better","Author":"=CC=","ReviewID":"R3IZZZMAHJDX3","Overall":"good","Content":"After doing some research out there, my girlfriend bought this digital camera.  The performance is very good, but there are still somethings I feel quite annoying. First, we just could not ignore the noise when the len zoom in/out. Second, after taking a picture, you can just review if for about a second or two, if you want to review it again, you have to turn off the camera, and turn on the LCD display again.. very unconvenient. Third, we have to lift the flash light to make it work. well, it is not totally automatic. And last, there's no USB interface to connect to PC, and the com port interface is too slow.. nobody can tolerate this I believe.  You have to buy an extra reader.In summery, it's a good product with excellent performance, on the other hand, based on my personal experience, my advice is, go to the market, try and feel it yourself, and think twice.","Date":"November 6, 2000"}

I love it!It's a rugged camera that I use for documenting local events for publishing almost daily on the web. For my  purposes, it does a wonderful job. The pictures are excellent for  publishing on the web and are still good enough for printing out on  photographic paper.With a 16MB card (purchased separately), I get 73  pictures at High Quality mode or 218 at Standard Quality mode. With that  many shots available I feel free to take many shots knowing that I'll end  up with only a few good ones. The batteries have never run out on me  during a photo session (normally 3 or 4 hours of taking pictures and  frequently turning the camera on and off) I usually don't use the monitor  screen that much...which I've been told drains the power rather  quickly.I would recommend getting a FlashPath floppy disk adapter. It  works faster when you're uploading pictures to your computer. One thing  to note is that there is a delay of about 1 second between the time you  press the shutter button and the time the camera actually takes the  picture.One of the things that sold me on the Olympus was the built-in  lens cover. I never have to worry about losing the cover and since it is  fairly compact, I feel comfortable sliding the camera into my front pocket.","Date":"June 18, 2000"}

I wanted a megapixel device that was compact, simple to operate, but with a few advanced features (macro, timer, etc) so that I could completely replace my Olympus SLR zoom film camera. The best deal was at........ south of midtown, for the D460zoom. This camera has a nice menu-driven LCD interface in addition to the top-mount traditional LCD \"frame counter\" display, so you can use it for snapshots or serious framed-in, carefully composed recordings. I use the HiRes mode exclusively, with a 32Mb flash card. It's a dream come true -- I no longer need to use a film camera at all.

{"Title":"A sophisticated little point 'n shoot with many features","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1ZHCI7RAMOFGH","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had my Olympus D460 for about two weeks now and it is a dream come true. Simple. Easy to use. Treat it like a straight point and shoot and just click away.  The zoom feature lets you frame what you're looking at IN THE VIEWFINDER(almost like an SLR). The standard PnS green light-red light also tells you when everything's ready and then --bingo-- you've got another good picture.  The D460 also has some bells and whistles that advanced amateurs or even pros will like.  My favorite:  a white balance adjustment that lets you use the available light from fluorescents or incandescants. That's an important feature, because this camera is very sensitive in even low light, and it permits good, color balanced photos in marginal light.  My earlier digital camera experience was with a Sony Mavica MD90, a much more expensive camera.  Frankly that Sony can't hold a candle to the D460.  Accessories: I bought the SanDisk FlashPath (Floppy Disk Adapter) with the D460 to eliminate PC cable hookups.  This took some looking because many retailers are out of them. But it was worth the search, because this particular FDA comes with batteries installed and a simple no-fuss installation disk.  All in all, the Olympus D460 camera is an excellent value and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to make a quality yet low cost entry into digital photography","Date":"December 14, 2000"}
{"Title":"Awesome camera for the $$$","Author":"Mark Cumberland","ReviewID":"R1V3WUPZI64ZV","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my second digital camera, replacing a Casio QV-700. The picture quality seems excellent and I was amazed at how vivid the colors turn out  with this camera. I have taken about a hundred pictures with the camera so  far and all but a few turned out excellent, and the ones that didn't were  my fault. One big advantage this camera has over my Casio is that the LCD  monitor has it's own power switch, so you can leave it off while taking  pictures and it saves on battery power.  There are several settings  such as ISO, white balance, etc that can be manually adjusted for better  picture quality or left on automatic if you rather not mess with them (like  myself). The on-screen menus are pretty user friendly after you read the  manual.  With the included 8MB Smartmedia card, you can record from  2-122 photos, depending on which of the 5 quality settings you choose. In  the 1280x960 resolution mode, you can take 36 pics in High Quality mode  (default), 18 in Super High Quality, or 2 pics in Super High Quality-TIFF  (uncompressed). In the 640x480 resolution mode, you can take 32 pics in  High Quality mode or 122 in Normal mode. Picking up a 16, 32, or 64 MB card  will greatly increase your capacity. I plan on getting a 32 MB card myself,  which will reportedly hold 146 pics in 1280x960 High Quality mode (or up to  489 pics in 640x480 normal mode).  The 3x zoom was better than expected.  There are a few things about the camera that I don't care for, such as  the main power switch. Instead of having an actual switch, you have to open  the lens barrier, which isn't a problem, however when you go to turn the  camera off, you have to close the lens barrier part way, then wait for the  lens to retract, then close the cover completely. Also, you must manually  flip up the flash.  Although there are a few minor things I wish were  different, don't pass up this camera!","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

I was pleased when I recieved my Olympus D460 camera it was everything I expected out of a digital camera. It has great zoom features, an easy to see lcd screen(indoors), easy to follow instruction manual and the 1.31 megapix is good enough quality to make my family ooh and ahh at the photos. However, there are a few drawbacks 1.31 megapix is only good up to 8x10 enlargements before it gets very grainy, you can't see the lcd screen in bright daylight ( this would hold true for any other camrea with an lcd as well ) While it comes with 8 megs of memory I bought a 32 mb upgrade so I could hold more than 32 photos. The serial interface for downloads is agonizingly slow, so you'll need a card reader as an accessory. Overall, its the best in its class if you have a budget under 400 dollars, if you're in to spending a bit more check out the D490 ( it boasts 2 megapix and better zoom features).","Date":"January 16, 2001"}

And I've seen the difference between the 460 and ANY of the Sony junk.. no comparison.  Olympus wins on picture quality hands-down.  No contest. That Macro feature for close-ups... what a hoot!

{"Title":"Great camera with lots of features for a very good price!","Author":"Takuya Arai","ReviewID":"R3KB9NZCY9TLCO","Overall":"good","Content":"Just picked this little baby up today and I am very happy with the purchase.  I've read quite a bit of reviews, both here and elsewhere and I pretty much had it narrowed down to a few models but I'm glad I went with this one.  I've had good experiences with Olympus film cameras before and it seems their high quality transferred over to the digital scene as well.  Sure, it's only 1.3 Megapixels and it might be a bit pricy for one considering you can get a 2.0 Megapixel camera cheaper but, the user friendliness and the sheer number of features make this camera far superior to the higher megapixel cheaper models.First off the pictures are crisp and clear and with the optical veiw finder available, you don't need to mess with the LCD screen and waste batteries.  The menu screen is easy to navigate (though a bit difficult to figure out the icons...) and this is truly where this camera shines.  Not only are you able to change the picture quality from standard 640 X 480 to uncompressed TIFFs, but you have to ability to adjust white balance, and more importantly, the ISO value!  You can also adjust the exposure compensations and, if you are using an Olympus memory card, you can do panorama shots as well.  Flipping through the pictures already in the card is a breeze, especially since you can use an idex view to see up to 16 shots at one time and deleting pictures is a snap.Unfortunately this camera doesn't come with USB support (...wonder why???) but pick up a USB card reader along with the camera and the problem is solved.  I picked up a PNY USB Flash Card Reader for ... and it installed in a second and transfering 6 shots at one time to the HD was almost instantaneous.If you're going on a long trip, you might want to either buy a bigger memory card and/or bring a pocket full of AA batteries but, for all intents and purposes, this is a great camera for us \"point and shoot\" types.  If you're looking for a good camera with excellent features for a great price, this is the one you want.","Date":"February 19, 2001"}

I also have a 1 M pixel HP Photosmart C20.  The Olympus is by far the better camera.The D460 is far easier to use (no need to read the manual), and the Olympus image transfer and editing software is much better than the HP software.The D460 will take well over 100 photos on 4 AA batteries.  The C20 will only take about 10. And the C20 will not run on NiCd batteries.  I always use NiCd batteries in my D460.  I have taken over 170 photos on a single charge.In all modes of operation, I have found that the D460 produces much better results than the C20.  I regularly print great looking 8x10s from my Olympus.I have used both cameras for shooting close ups.  The Olympus works much better in macro mode.  I have even had very good luck using the flash in macro mode.  Using the macro mode in combination with the 3:1 optical zoom, I can take a full frame photo of a silver dollar.I had great fun using the D460's panorama mode on a trip to the Grand Canyon.  The Olympus software automatically stiches multiple images into a single, very high resolution, panorama.  One word of caution:  Certain features, such a the panorama mode, are only supported when you use genuine Olympus smart media cards.  Don't buy \"compatible\" smart media cards even if they are gauranteed to be 100% compatible.Like most digital cameras, the flash on the D460 is very close to the lense.  Consequently, red eye can be a problem.  The D460 is equipped with a red eye flash function which usually helps to prevent red eye.  Often, I still find that it necessary to remove red eye with the Olympus software that came with the camera.If you plan to spend less than $400, I highly recommend the D460.","Date":"December 17, 2000"}

That was taken with simply  pointing and clicking, so it would have looked even better had I changed  some settings.  This camera has plenty of more adjustments to make (and I  will love learning them).However, expect to buy a USB reader and another  card (I bought the \"Viking IntelliFlash USB Flash Memory Reader\"  and  \"SanDisk SDSM-32-490 32MB SmartMedia Card\") which will add a  little over a hundred bucks more to the price.  Also, the software  sometimes doesn't seem to recognize when the camera is plugged in (no big  deal, just turn off and on again) and with the serial connection plan on  waiting a long while!  Once I get me reader, I plan to not even use the  software provided unless I want to change some settings in the camera (like  the time), or if I want to stitch pan shot together.I do want to address  one thing a guy said about its feel.  It does NOT have a cheap feel.  YES,  it has a plastic case, but it doesn't have that cheap feel like some of  Fuji's lower end cameras (if you've held that square one they have, you'll  know what I mean).

It is my second digital camera, my first was a Fuji MX-1200, a really great little camera also.  The Olympus is not quite as easy to use as the Fuji but after my recent trip to China, I wanted something a little more capable than the Fuji.  Since I consider myself an \"advanced amateur\", I have been giving all the \"bells and whistles\" a workout since I got it.I am particularly pleased with ability to spot meter for back lit situations, shoot \"burst mode\", the zoom, and the ability to select the \"ISO\" (film speed).  The exposures I get with the Olympus are also more accurate than the Fuji.  The Fuji tended to underexpose in all but bright sunlight, forcing me to do a lot of image adjusting in Photoshop.  The Olympus is generally \"right on\".  I also really like the software bundled with the Olympus.  I purchased a USB Smartmedia reader for the Fuji because I couldn't get the Fuji software to install under Windows 2000.  The Olympus software installed fine under Win2K and works really well.  It may even cut down the time I spend with Photoshop.I really, really like the quality of the resulting images.  Olympus makes fine lenses and It's SHQ (Super High Quality) mode lets you take either uncompressed TIFF images as well as \"low compression\" JPEG's.  I have printed images suitable for framing on an HP2000 Cse and a Tektronix Phaser 850 up to 8 x 10.  They compare very favorably with images taken with my 35MM SLR and scanned on my Epson Perfection.Finally, the highest praise I can give this camera is that I am giving serious consideration to leaving my assortment of cameras, lenses, motor drives, filters etc. home on my next trip.  Hope this helps.","Date":"January 15, 2001"}

The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER! (forget about the sound).  The worst part of the camera is the battery consumption. I got tired of wasting lots of $ buying more and more batteries. It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something. Maybe you woun't take this to serious when you buy an item. But what I can tell you is that wasting 4$ (here that's what it costs 4 AA batt) for just 15 minutes is not a deal.","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

I have been very pleased with the overall performance of this camera.  You will never want to use a film camera again!  Knowing what your pictures look like while you can still retake them is great!  The LCD screen is usually enough to see what your picture will look like or you can view your pictures on the TV.  Included is a NTSC video output cable to plug the camera into the \"video in\" on your TV or VCR.  You really notice the excellent quality of the image that way, as well as a great way to share your pictures with everyone in the room. It comes with batteries, Mac/WIN serial cable, 8MB memory card, & software.  Everything you need to open the box and start clicking.The instructions included are easy to follow.  The software is limited on the editing it will do, however I have found that I don't really want to edit most pictures, because they turn out fine.  The 8MB SmartMedia card included is adequate.  I purchased a 64MB card and don't regret it!  You can take around 730 pictures on SQ-high quality, 250 pictures on HQ and 150 pictures on SHQ.  More than enough for a trip where you aren't able to upload pictures to your computer and clear your memory card. The downside, it eats batteries like all digital cameras.  Purchase the Olympus battery charger and TWO sets of batteries for it.  That way you are always covered with a spare set charged.  Remember your printer will determine the quality your prints are going to be.  A regular inkjet (like the Lexmark 3200) just doesn't have the quality that one like the HP Photosmart P1000 does.  I can print an 8x10 picture (SHQ) on the HP that is photo quality. Pick up a camera case too because it doesn't come with one.  Hint: You really don't have to buy anything extra to make this a great purchase.  The rechargeable batteries, 64MB card, and camera case are not absolutely necessary to enjoy this camera.  Just stuff that I found after using it for a year makes it a little bit nicer.","Date":"November 23, 2001"}

A word of advice that I heard from a techie friend:  Go out and buy the NiMH rechargeable batteries and recharge those before you get your camera.  Apparently the rechargeable batteries lose their power even when they are not being used (i.e.  in your camera bag), but the lithium batteries don't.  You should save the lithium batteries as backups in case you are stuck with dead rechargeables.","Date":"December 20, 2000"}

Compared to some higher end cameras it was  very reasonably priced and worth the risk.  I didn't want to buy my first  digital camera for $800. The quality of the LCD is great so you can review  your pictures immediately and clearly.  The camera is so easy to use.  I  had it figured out for the most part before opening the instructions, but I  would definitely give those a look.  The zoom is good for the price of the  camera.  The best thing about this digital camera is that it is the size of  a regular camera.  There is no extra baggage.  It fits into a regular  camera case with no problems.Downloading the pictures is really easy.  I  did purchase a reader for the Smart Media Cards (which is basically the  film) which really quickens the downloading to computer process.  It was  only like $30.  I also got some rechargeable batteries, but I didn't even  need them until 8 days into my honeymoon.  The orginal batteries lasted a  long time and through a lot of exploring.I would suggest getting a  bigger Smart Media card than the one that comes with the camera (8mb).  I  got a 32 mb card which basically gives you close to 200 pictures in the  middle range of quality.For a non-professional who just wants to capture  moments of fun and wants the ease of downloading them to the computer and  then sending them to people, this camera is perfect.  I haven't tried to  have them printed up by a website yet, but I will do that soon.  It is a  solid product and I would always side toward Olympus.","Date":"June 25, 2000"}

I've been debating for a long time whether to get a digital camera.  I use a variety of digital cameras at work and know  how useful they are.  This one had the price that I wanted to pay and the  performance of $1000+ cameras from a couple of years ago.  The colors look  great.  The software is a breeze to use.  The quality of the camera seems  to be very good so far.I would have scored this camera 5 out of 5 if it  came with a case and a USB connector.  It is slow to download with the  serial cable.

{"Title":"Still a good camera, but showing its age.","Author":"Chan Lee Meng","ReviewID":"R1JYUPWESJ0L71","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my D-460 in Sept last year. I would have given it a 4-star rating then, but now it warrants only 3 stars from me. After 10 months of steady use, I can now point out its deficiencies:1. The lack of USB connection which makes it horribly slow to download pictures. It can take up to 10 minutes to download a full card! I had to buy a SM card reader to save time, which meant more $$ required.2. A very noticeable shutter lag, i.e. there is a delay of about .5 to .75 sec between the time you press the shutter release, and when the camera actually captures the shot. This camera is definitely not suitable for capturing \"the decisive moment\". If you've previously used an anolog SLR camera (like I did), this delay is unacceptable.3. There is also noticeable barrel distortion from the lens. Basically it means the lens makes people look fat and straight lines bulge outwards. To be fair, this is a fairly common problem in consumer digicams, and you can fix the problem with good photo-editing software. 4. The \"guillotine\" lens cover. It is quite easy to bash the lens when trying to close the retractable lens cover. You're supposed to slide the cover forward SLIGHTLY (but not touch the lens), wait for the lens to completely retract into the camera, then slide the cover completely shut. Whose bright idea was that?!Don't get me wrong though. This camera still serves me well (I work for a newspaper). The D-460 has many plus points which others have covered previously, so I won't repeat them. But before you decide to buy it, consider the four drawbacks I mentioned above.","Date":"July 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"Good camera, but some noticable drawbacks","Author":"\"miklaustin\"","ReviewID":"R311Y3QWJNRX7M","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this camera for about 4 months.  Starting out, I thought wow, this camera has everything: zoom, autofocus, flash, memory cards, the whole bit.  But somethings i've noticed about it sometimes get me to worrying about it. First of all, everytime you open the screen, it takes about 3 or 4 seconds for the zoom lens to pop in and/or out.  This is bad because it wastes the batteries if you keep doing it for taking different pictures. Next, when taking the picture, you push the button, and it takes about 1 second for the shutter to actually flash.  I think this is because of all the focusing and dithering. Also, you can use the viewfinder to see pictures once you take them.  But to review them, you have to completely close the lens, wait the 3 or 4 seconds, and then hit a button to turn on the screen and wait for the picture to load.  This is not absolutely horrible, but sometimes I am in a hurry. Biggest thing:  While taking the biggest quality picture.. the camera will take like an entire minute to load the picture to the disk.  This is horrible because in a minute, the thing you may be shooting will be gone, or the group of people will become antzy. The serial port is so slow, its like having a really slow internet download.  On the plus side, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  It has 2 sizes, the larger size has 3 quality options, and the smaller has 3.  The higher quality ones look quite nice.  Very clear, very good lighting.  Everyone always complains because the pictures are so clear, you can see every blemish. Overall, great camera, but sometimes the lengthiness of the operations can be a bit overcoming.","Date":"July 11, 2001"}

It's the only digital camera I've owned and I really enjoy it.  It's been on several vacations and numerous holidays with us and I seem to learn something new about it each time I use it. Once you read the manual several times and figure out the menus, you get the hang of what settings will provide the best shot.  The Auto setting will cover most normal conditions, but special settings are required to get shots of things that are moving or have unusual lighting.  It's easy to experiment and just dispose of the bad shots.  Battery life is good, but I strongly advise two sets of rechargables to always be prepared.  The download of pictures through the provided serial cable can be slow, but just relax and have a cup of coffee.  I've used numerous Internet services to develop my digital pictures and the quality is as good as any 35mm.  The advantage here is that you get to always pick out a perfect picture.

{"Title":"It's great!  I love it! But keep the SLR...","Author":"Charles White","ReviewID":"R2QCD3E5CDGPX2","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had more photo fun and taken more pictures since buying  this camera than during the rest of my life put together.  With no film to lose I can really make sure I like a picture by doing what the pro's do: take a lot of pictures and select the best ones.  I generally run the 460 at maximum resolution since it isn't particularly endowed in the pixel area.  The color rendition is excellent as well as the autoexposures.  Basically, if you can see it, it can photograph it.  Some of the night shots are quite impressive.The 3X optical zoom is good.  I wouldn't have a digital camera without it.  The lens is prone to \"barrel distortion\" where straight line things like poles and trees at the edges of the frame appear to bend toward the center.  A little strategic framing can make that less of a problem.  The camera is rather slow when trying to do live action shots.  It takes about a second between button press and shutter release.  This is an eternity when trying to photograph my son doing a bike trick or catching a hawk on the wing.  Being an old SLR hobbyist, I miss my telephoto and my filters.  I miss an instant shutter release and other areas of total control. In fact, we're shopping for a replacement for our old Canon AT-1. An SLR digital camera with the capabilities of a film SLR is just  way too expensive for me right now.  So I will continue to have two cameras: my super fun and somewhat amazing D-460Z and my SLR. Each with its own strengths, each with its own creativity.","Date":"August 8, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great bang for the buck","Author":"S. Winder \"computer nerd\"","ReviewID":"R1JXR9JS595GLJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this camera for about a year now. It takes excellent pictures and is well-suited for producing photo-quality prints. It writes the pictures to memory at a decent speed, and has a rapid sequential mode at the lowest resolution. There is a slight delay for autofocus when you take the picture, but if you depress the button halfway while you're setting up the shot, pressing the button the rest of the way will take the picture instantly (much the same as in many autofocus 35mm cameras).Battery life with the included lithium batteries is excellent, but beware--they cost about [price]each (you need two). I have had a lot of success using rechargeable NiMH batteries; the battery life with NiMH is still decent, and it doesn't cost much more to get started with them than it does to buy a replacement lithium set.Picture quality leaves nothing to be desired. You even have the option of taking pictures in a lossless format (TIFF as opposed to JPEG). This is great for pictures that you need to enlarge. Note, though, that one or two uncompressed pictures can fill up the average-sized memory card. The special features work well and can be useful, although the default settings are good enough that the average point-and-shoot user will never need to change them. The lighting and macro features are particularly well-done; you can take close-up shots in macro mode that would typically require an SLR camera in the world of film.The camera's weakest point is in its serial link. It works fine, but you can spend a long time waiting for the pictures to transfer to your computer. It would be wise to figure the cost of a USB smartmedia reader into the total price for the camera--with my Lexar reader, the images transfer in a matter of seconds.I did a lot of research before buying this camera and can say that I was not in the least disappointed with the results. You would be hard-pressed to find a worthy competitor in this price range.","Date":"July 18, 2001"}
{"Title":"Don't get it without USB reader","Author":"Chan Lee Meng","ReviewID":"R3PXD1NG9PW3LZ","Overall":"good","Content":"A USB smartmedia reader should be mandatory, not optional with this camera. If not, you'll waste too much time downloading images. For example, an 8MB clip full of  images (about 17 at Super High Quality mode) takes about 10 minutes to download via my PowerMac's serial port. Download times thru a PC serial port are about the same. Contrast this to about 20 seconds with a ZiO USB smartmedia reader. I bought this camera about 6 months ago for ... from another vendor. And that was WITHOUT a card reader. ... current deal offers much better value.Another flaw in this model is its \"guillotine\" sliding cover feature. While the design looks elegant, it's also quite easy to bash the lens with the sliding cover (you need to push the cover halfway to trigger the lens retraction into the body).Also note that this camera doesn't come with an AC adapter (that's \"optional\"), so you'd also drain your batteries if you download pix via serial port. Did I mention that a USB smartmedia reader should be mandatory with this camera?On the plus side, this camera does takes great pictures, has a wider aperture (f2.8) than most cameras in this range, and also a great panorama feature with stitching software. There's also exposure compensation and ISO selection (125, 250, 500).I rate it a bit under 4 stars.","Date":"March 21, 2001"}

It features 'burst mode' shooting (great for sports events, etc), superior optics, a great 3x (plus 2x digital) zoom and USB transfer (though only a memory card reader will make you love the simplicity of digital cameras). The included 8 meg SmartMedia card will handle about 100 480 X 640 pics, and larger cards are easily found and reasonably priced. The 1.2 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for everything from emails to printing 5 x 7s. The flash, battery life and software are acceptable.

The controls are pretty easy to use and once I read through the manual I had no trouble. It also included a set of NiMh rechargeable batteries and a charger in addition to the disposable batteries. That was a nice perk.On the down side and the reason I did not give it a full five stars is: The front cover is a little awkward to use until you get used to it. Having to slide it partway closed, let the lense retract and the finish closing is a bit strange. The other thing and what I think is the most serious flaw is the serial cable connection. It is very slow. Olympus should have included either a USB connection instead or some kind of USB media reader or floppy adapter. I realize some people do not have a USB port which is probably why the serial connection is still in use. All-in-all, the camera is a great value and high quality for the money. If you can afford the extra money, buy the D490Z instead. But again, this camera works great. The images are generally clear and in focus and the software does a great job of removing redeye and auto adjusting the brightness and contrast. Of course, like any camera, digital or film, there will be some bad shots. The plus is you can delete these and try again.","Date":"April 7, 2001"}

I have read all the reviews on this web page before I decided to purchase one.  And was I glad that I did choose this one.  Quite a few people warned about the lid that cover the lense, they said that if you are not carefull, you could damage the lense.  But I found out that it was design so that the lid stop before the lense retract without touching the lense.  I tried about a hundred times to see if it rubbed against the lense, but fail to make the lid rub against or scratch it.  So my conclusion is that it was design with an amazing precision; to the naked eyes, it looks like the lid rub against the lense but there is always a small space between the lid and the lense to guarantee that the lid will never damage the lense.  Beside the precision design of the lid, this camera takes great pictures every time.

I am crazy about this camera, and I have convinced at least three other people to buy it.The D-460Z is lightweight, comes with a flash, digital and optical zoom, and optical and LCD viewfinders.  I generally use the LCD viewfinder because it's convenient.  The camera will take low-light shots without the flash, which has been a nice transition from the 35mm film cameras I've had in the past.  The zoom is also a very nice feature that I didn't have on my film cameras.The camera uses SmartMedia storage cards, which can be bought at Wal-Mart and Target.  They're not very expensive.  The camera came with the 8mb SmartMedia card, which holds 36 images when the pictures are stored at the default size (about twice the size that I like to send in emails).  It also only comes with the serial port connector.  Many people feel that this is too slow, but I have no problems with it.  It probably takes 5-10 minutes to download 36 images from the camera.  You can purchase a SmartMedia card reader that connects via a USB port.  That is supposed to be faster, but I haven't found it necessary.I have bought a few extra components for the camera.  It does not come with a case, but it fits normal 35mm camera cases fine.  I bought a 32mb SmartMedia storage card (holds about 144 images in default size) as well as a four-pack of NiMH batteries and a recharger.  The camera came with batteries that lasted quite a long time, but when they went out, it was nice to have the rechargeables.  The rechargeable batteries will last me about a weekend of picture-taking before requiring a night in the recharger.  The camera will use regular AA batteries, but you will have to change them at least once a day.I have been very happy with this camera and I strongly urge others to purchase one as well.  I have found the software and the LCD control panel to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.","Date":"October 11, 2001"}

One is that it eats batteries up like candy [I go through a 4 pack every 2 weeks] and that the serial download takes forever!!!  This camera is definately worth the money!

{"Title":"Great Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RCDNM0WS69DFB","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Olympus D460 because my friends have had good luck with Olympus products.  Having an iMac with only USB ports was a concern, but an Entrega USB-to-Serial converter works just fine.  Downloads are a bit slow to the computer.  The battery life is amazing in these cameras, as long as you don't use the viewing screen much (normally it is off when you're taking photos using the manual viewfinder).  I've had this camera for over a month with the same set of orginal batteries.  At 122 photos in standard quality, I've taking hundreds of photos on one set.  I have purchased a AA battery charger and a few spare sets of NiMH AA batteries (from Batteries Plus).The photo quality is amazing.  I've had some problems with the MACRO mode-- the image seems to want to be much higher than what I'm pointing at, but other than that, the camera is great.Night photos only work with a tripod... and photos of bright objects at night (such as the Moon) really do not turn out well.  So this is pretty much a daylight or flash camera.I'm not sure  you can even purchase this camera any more, but I prefer the optics to some of the newer models.It also has a cord to  hook up to your TV-- we have watched some of my photo shoots on big screen TV's.. which is just great.  At ($) this camera is a fantastic deal.","Date":"September 26, 2001"}

However I decided to spend a few more dollars and get the 460 because the zoom was more useful than just a point and shoot. I wasn't  disappointed, besides taking the same great pictures, the controls are more  ergonomically arranged, and has a few more bells and whistles.  The  only down side that I can find with the camera is turning it off. You must  be careful not to hit the lens barrel with the lens cover when sliding it  back.

If the lcd display is used you will see very short battery life.  I bought an optional ac adapter to save battery life when uploading pictures onto my computer.  I also bought a set of rechargeable NiMh batteries w/ a charger.  Both are a must!I am a resolution freak, so this camera doesnt deliver the resolution quality I hoped for.  But then again, I am a very picky person and to the \"average\" person the quality is probably fine.  Most people that see the pictures I take comment on the great quality.  I have never printed any photos out yet since my printer is archaic and I know it wouldnt do a good job.  So I cant comment on this end of things.I have had the camera in for service.  This was my fault though.  The camera took a pretty good beating on the back of my atv this spring.  Ended up costing me $108 to repair.  Quite a bit considering I paid $280 for the camera.  I found out the hard way that digital cameras are quite a bit more sensitive than your average 35 mm film camera!  And yes, I was pleased with Olympus service department.","Date":"July 31, 2001"}

The pictures are first rate.  For a \"lower\" priced camera, it is full of all of the bells and whistles you could ask for.  The  Panorama feature is my favorite.  If you're not into gizmos, just point and  shoot.  It's very simple.  I've never used one before and I was e-mailing  pictures to my family within 30 minutes after the UPS driver handed it to  me.Only two minor complaints.  The attached lens cover (which is great)  has to be closed part way until the lens retracts back into the camera.  This has to be done gingerly as it is too easy to jam it against the side  of the lens by accident.  Also, on the top of the camera is a small  electronic control panel that tells you how many pictures you have left,  picture quality etc.  The symbols across the top row are very hard to see  as they are too close to the camera body.  A slight shadow covers them  unless you have plenty of light.All things considered, I'd buy it again  in a second.","Date":"June 21, 2000"}

It has all the features and functions necessary to take quality pictures and enjoy them in digital fashion.  The camera is sturdy, lightweight, and easy to use.I'm still working with the supplied software.  All in all it was easy to install and use, although I am puzzled by its inability to allow you to edit out things like red-eye.  I'm using another piece of software for that.A couple of peeves:  Although its nice not to worry about a lense cap, the motorized sliding cover seems to inviting trouble in the long term.  Also, the LCD screen is excruciatingly slow when scrolling through previous pictures.  I haven't found a way to randomly access them on the camera, so you have to go through them one by one, which, when you have 30 or 40 stored up, is very tedious.Overall, you could spend more and get some 'extra' features, but I doubt its worth it.  This is one of the best cameras for the price, which means you won't feel so bad when the next generation of cameras come out and you want one.","Date":"January 24, 2001"}

It's extremely durable.  I've dropped it at least a dozen times, and while there are plenty of scuff marks on the exterior case, I've never had any damage to the functionality of the camera.Back in 2000, this was state of the art.  Decent quality, decent zoom, at a good value.  Today, I'd recommend spending the extra bucks to get something with a better optical zoom (you can't rely on the digital zoom for quality) and higher megapixels.  But as far as delivering what this camera advertises, it is right on.Based on my experience, I plan to buy another model from Olympus when I upgrade.  The durability factor alone makes them worth it.The Olympus cammedia software that comes for downloading your pictures does leave something to be desired.  It's a very slow interface.  For transferring pics off your memory card, I recommend investing in a stand-alone memory card reader.  It's worth it for the saved time, and you won't be draining your batteries every time you transfer pictures from your camera.","Date":"May 14, 2005"}

Its a wonderful camera but as of times today it is becoming extremely dated.  Some of its features have been improved upon in recent years.  I have a friend that has an Olympus C-5050 and viewed some of his photos that were taken.  The rich color and detail compared to my old camera can be easily seen.  The time when digital pictures will meet or exceed the detail on 35mm is almost here!  I bought this old camera for 2.5X the price it is today so that goes to show what 3 years can do to prices.  But the picture you want to take probably won't wait that long.  I would recommend the Olympus line of cameras to anyone!  They are a strong performer and reliable too!

Luckily, the design of the camera makes it rather durable. I was shocked  when I saw my new camera headed for the pavement as it slipped out of my  hand, but relieved when I found it had survived with only a few scratches  on the lens cover.

{"Title":"Solid digital camera at a decent price!","Author":"Ron Cole","ReviewID":"R2NYHBG5O0YY14","Overall":"good","Content":"I'll echo most of the other reviews here: like the D-450Z, the D-460Zis a great digital camera for the price. Though I disliked the switchto the cheaper plastic housing with this model, the increased ease of use when navigating the menus more than makes up for it. Like the previous camera, you still get high-quality digital pictures with a number of features including red-eye removing flash, television display of pictures, 3x optical (lens) and 2x digital (computer) zoom, and a host of other features which make this camera one of the best in it's class. But since the earlier releases in this line, digital camera technology has increased while price has decreased (thanks in a large part to earlier models in this line, which took the market by storm). You can now get cameras with a higher level of megapixels and resolution for about the same price as the D-460Z such as Nikon's Coolpix 800 and the Kodak DC280. You should go to your local. . . consumer electronics store and look at ALL of your choices before deciding on which model to purchase (and then purchase it on-line because it is cheaper ;). Even though the D-460Z is no longer \"cutting edge,\" I still believe it has enough features and stunning quality to let it surpass many of the other choices in its class. Accessories: Expect to spend a few hundred dollars in additional accessories for this camera. I recommend at least 8 NiMH rechargable batteries for power (which you can buy on-line or at your local supermarket), a USB Smartmedia reader if your computer supports USB (this greatly decreases SLOW picture transfer times from the camera to the computer), and a \"soft\" protective case for the camera (the Olympus soft leather case is nice but over-priced unless you get it on sale). As well, 2 additional 32 meg or a 64 meg SmartMedia card is useful, and will allow you to take a vacation's worth of pictures without have to delete any (at least at the rate I take pictures). The camera lets you take a little more than 2x the SmartCard's megs in super-high quality, compressed images. You can buy these on-line at places like amazon.com... but the Olympus-brand accessories tend to go out of stock quickly.  Note: the SmartMedia cards will eventually wear out, though you'll be able to take tens of thousand (or even hundreds of thousands) of pictures before this happens if you buy a decent-quality card.","Date":"May 19, 2000"}

It has refreshed my interest in photography and has been much fun recording all kinds of events and sharing the images with friends. The supplied \"Camedia\" software allows for a little more than just basic editing and is similiarily easy to use. I find the fold up flash inconvenient. I sometimes forget to place it in its armed position and miss an opportunity. The switch behind the sliding cover which retracts the lens and protects the camera would be better positioned to operate a bit sooner so you would not have to be so careful to avoid hitting the lens when closing the case.The light weight and smooth compact design of the camera are real high points. When closed, it fits in a pocket or pouch without ever snagging on anything and is well protected. When open, the design allows for trouble free recording without fear of damaging delicate parts.","Date":"December 30, 2001"}

Picture quality is very nice, and the camera itself is easy to use.My only gripe is the battery cover.  Because of where it is and the direction it slides (and the fact that the batteries are literally spring-loaded projectiles), it's really easy to bump or grab the camera so that the battery compartment springs open, spilling the batteries and requiring you to re-enter the time and date (if you do).  Many times I've pulled the camera out, only to fumble with getting the batteries back into it.Other than that, I love it!  Oh, and I'd recommend getting a USB reader for the memory.  I didn't think that waiting for the serial download would be that big of a deal, but it gets irksome.  A larger memory card would be a long wait.","Date":"October 8, 2001"}

It is my first digital camera. So far Its seems to be a good unit. I have found only two things to complain about; 1> - the included batteries can cause some confusion, if you follow the instruction manual, to load them. The battery polarity indicator diagram ,on the bottom of the camera, just doesn't match the polarity label on the included Olympus batteries (i.e. it looks like they load with polarity reversed..not a good thing). The manual has diagrams for loading individual AA batteries with polarity clearly indicated (which matches the diagram on the camera) but the diagram that illustrates loading the included battery packs has no polarity indicated!?!? The battery packs are 'Keyed' so you can only insert them one way. After arguing with myself over the conflicting info , I inserted the batteries, and the camera came up and works fine. Now I have to resolve this problem again when I use rechargeable individual NiMh batteries. Olympus really needs to rethink the instructions. I bet more than a few people have tried to use individual AA batteries , loaded them backwards and fried the camera. Tsk. Tsk. Major Oversight Olympus. I understand that the Olympus batteries are very expensive, perhaps Olympus concluded that a little dis-information could equal increased profits?? The Technically impaired may well resort to using only the Olympus brand in order to avoid problems??.  Compliaint #2 >It sure could use a USB port,but hey .... I guess you can't have everything.

Then the tiny Canon digital camera came out.. so I sold the D-340 and bought the Canon digital camera. While it was nice and small, it didn't take the quality of pictures that the Olympus did, nor did it fit the hand right.  I sold the Canon digital camera and bought this one in January of 2001.  I also bought some rechargeable 2AA batteries at the same time and finally had to use them.  The batteries that come with the camera (lithium, I believe) JUST died this January (2002)!  I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera! (Maybe thousands!)  Anyhow, the camera is designed to fit your hand. The size is about what a normal camera might be. If I had a bigger purse, it would probably fit.  I just bought a small digital camera bag for it. I can toss in the battery charger, etc. I like the quality of the zoom. The only thing that I don't care for is that the flash has to be flipped up in order to use it.  I guess this is good and bad.  Good because if you DON'T want to use flash for a picture, just don't flip it up (less having to do with settings, etc.). Bad, though, in case you forget to flip it up when you need the flash.  All in all, I will definitely stick with the Olympus brand for digital cameras.","Date":"February 4, 2002"}

At 1.3MP, the quality of images is much better than what I achieved on modern 10MP cameras. This was absolutely fantastic camera - the sliding door cover was extremely useful and rugged, user menues were very intuitive and responsive, the focus rocker was very precise. I dragged this camera on many outdoor trips...many times it tumbled, was dropped in sand...but in the end it always came back to life. Ultimately after the camera broke I searched for a replacement, but unfortunately Olympus never followed up with anything as good. Since then I moved on to Canon, Panasonic and Nikon cameras. I briefly went returned to Olympus for the 790 series. While I liked the rugged features, the limited photo options and poor image quality didn't impress me.

{"Title":"Great Cammera but a battery eater!","Author":"Agustin A Barrutia","ReviewID":"R29OVX43M7TCIA","Overall":"good","Content":"Well first of all I should say that this camera is perfect for the principiant or \"tourist\" photographer, that the only thing he want's to do is to capture the moment without controlling it all. The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER! (forget about the sound).  The worst part of the camera is the battery consumption. I got tired of wasting lots of $ buying more and more batteries. It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something. Maybe you woun't take this to serious when you buy an item....","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

I like that the flash is manual (it doesn't automatically pop up when it detects there isn't enough light) because it gives me a little more control. I have never had a problem with the lens cover hitting the lens when closing it. The lens cover basically is a \"two click\" close; one to activate the lens to swivel down into the base and then the next to complete the closing of the cover.

{"Title":"One camera that does it all","Author":"\"wavshrdr\"","ReviewID":"R3GQPNKDBPE5G","Overall":"good","Content":"I had the predecessor to this camera the 2020Z.  Great camera but I wanted audio capability.  Everything I liked about the 2020Z is here and more.  Its still compact (fits in pockets better than most), EASY on batteries,  excellent colors, fast lens (2020Z is faster), fast shot recovery, wireless  remote and very light weight.  The 3030Z expands on the 2020Z with one  lever zoom for both optical and digital modes, higher resolution (won't  gain you much on average size pictures), more control over power off and on  settings.  Some things that I do miss about the 2020Z are it's faster lens  and the ability to shot 30 frames per second in low resolution movie mode.  You do have a large memory buffer on the 3030Z so you can shoot 5 frames in  best resolution mode in a little over a second!  While no camera can yet do  it all this one comes very close.  I currently have an Olympus 2500L, 500L,  2020Z and Nikon Coolpix 950 and this is my favorite by far.  The only  things I would change on the 3030Z are: an incredibly close macro mode like  the 950/990 Nikon, standard NiMH batteries and charger like my 2020Z,  faster lens of the 2020Z (one of the fastest on a digital), 30 fps in all  movie modes as well as optical instead of digital zoom with movies and the  nifty little exposure histogram like on the high-end Nikons.  Those minor  quibbles aside it is an outstanding camera.  It doesn't eat batteries,  takes great pictures (not just great digital pictures) and is very fast  between shots and from the time your press the shutter to the shot is  actually taken.  If you have used a Kodak 280 or 290 you know how  aggravating it is to press the shutter and wait...wait... wait... until you  finally lose the once in a lifetime shot you actually wanted to take.It  is tough to go wrong if you buy this camera.  It is not cheap but it is an  excellent value.  The \"boot up\" time of the camera is really quick too. If  you are willing to trade off a slightly smaller memory buffer for burst  mode and slightly less recording time in movies as well the Olympus 3000Z  is a good choice and you will save about $200.  One big plus often  overlooked is the software that comes bundled with the camera.  The  software included with the Nikon's is basic at best.  If you buy the 3030Z  you get Adobe Photoshop 5 LE which is an outstanding program that gives you  a lot of control over editing your images.  It may be the \"light\" version  of Photoshop but it is still incredibly powerful. This does NOT come with  the 3000Z though!  I think that is part of the pricing difference between  the two.  One other big plus about the Olmpus \"C\" series in general is that  you rarely get \"red eye\" when using the built in flash.  I can't seem to  avoid it on my Nikon 950 and my friend has the same problem on his Nikon  990.  The 3030Z does a great job in low light conditions without the flash  too.  Buy one, it's a great camera!","Date":"June 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"IMPRESSED!","Author":"Andre L. Aragon","ReviewID":"R2NQEAVINA1H02","Overall":"good","Content":"Being a tech geek, I did a bit of research on the various websites and narrowed my choices between the Olympus 3030 and Nikon 9090.  It seemed to be a toss up depending on which features you valued most.  I chose the Olympus for a variety of reasons and haven't regretted my decision.  First of all, the picture quality exceeded my expectations from the very first picture.  I've taken a variety of shots from the different settings and even with the \"avereage\" quality setting of images, the detail the camera picked up is unbelievable.  I've even zoomed in on the images with various photo editing programs and still can't detect any distortion.  Secondly, the installation of the provided software was a easy.  A nice bonus to the software was the supplying of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE, a slimmed down version of the very popular photo editing program that sets the industry standard for professional photo editing.  Third, Olympus provided a USB cable for downloading images from the camera to the PC, which speeds up the process tremendously when comparing it to a Serial transfer.  The few complaints I have concern more of the decisions of Olympus for what they provided instead of the overall quality of the camera.  First, why in the heck didn't they provide a charger and rechargable batteries?  Sure, they upgraded to Lithium batteries but this camera eats a lot of juice when using the LCD monitor.  And how about providing an AC adaptor for those times we want to download all our images or use the camera indoors.  Second, I had to go out and purchase a little lens cap strap since the cap isn't connected to the camera.  Having to place the cap in and out of my pocket when I want to take pictures is asking for the cap to be lost (especially when making the family trips to Disneyland).Finally, the Olympus also uses the Smartmedia data storage and provides you with a 16MB card.  This isn't bad depending on what setting you have your camera on (the higher the quality, the less pictures you can take) but I would consider purchasing an additional memory card with a higher capacity.  As of this date, I believe the highest amount of MB that Smartmedia makes is 64Mb.  I know the Nikon uses the Compact Flash system and can go a as high as 128MB.  That's a feature to consider (well, the cost for a 128MB Compact Flash card runs on average is about $300).","Date":"December 8, 2000"}

I agree with Jim DuLaney on the  shutter delay of digital cameras.  I am use to the release on my Canon F-1 and A-1.  However, you can shoot again while the camera is still recording the image to the SmartMedia Card.PLEASE NOTE:  \"Slopedirk\" (see his review) must not have used the owner's manual.  You most certainly can set your own default settings, such as your preferred resolution; whether you want flash or no flash; shutter priority or aperture priority, and the preferred setting; etc.The menu selections are fairly simple once you play with the camera awhile.  As for the problem of taking the lens cap off before turning on the power - buy the extender tube (an Olympus accessory).  This tube is needed if you attach accessory lenses.  I find it very useful because it allows me to use a filter (Haze, UV, Skylight, etc.).  I leave it on at all times!A good companion book for any digital camera: Digital Photography For Dummies, by Julie Adair(find it at [amazon])... This is an excellent resource and also explains imaging software (Photoshop, etc.) and printing. (Don't let the title steer you away.

In the end, I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature. (I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family.) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures. Family picture takers will like this camera. It takes great pictures, easy to transfer using USB, and comes bundled with great software. The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible. It is relatively easy to use, but I have not mastered making quick changes yet. A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor. Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes. You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features. They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user...If you are buying this camera, you should also get extra memory and batteries. You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter. I haven't tried rechargeables yet, but that may be my next purchase.","Date":"December 10, 2000"}

The surprise is how fast the manual reads and how simple to follow the instructions are!  Who knew?  This is my first experience with a digital camera of any kind after 26 years in the  darkroom working in cold water -- and what a treat.  I can override the  shutter speed, the aperture or both and get the same effects as with my old  manual Nikon -- and do it in color, sepia, or black and white.  What's  more, the flash is versitile and easy to switch off for ambient light work  -- and even the fully automatic settings turn out some fine exposures.  It self corrects for florescent, tungsten, shade or sun -- it zooms  tight for close ups without requiring lots of extra lens purchases up front  -- it gives me enough flexibility in dpi / resolution that I can shoot 40  or 300 frames on a single disk -- and it's easy to download into my little  Mac iBook thanks to the included software -- it does everything I would  have on my wish list if I were making up this camera myself....No  problems.  Just be sure and get extra Nimh batteries and lots of smartmedia  to play with.

You can't tell the difference between prints from this camera and that of a good 35MM SLR. It's amazing. Be aware that this camera is only USB compatable if your PC has Windows98 and not the upgrade. Windows 95 users will need to purchase a floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to a PC. A Serial Port Cable also works with Windows95. I had a Sony FD-91 Mavaca Digital before I bought this Olympus and the C-3030 has the Mavaca beat hands down. So if you want a digital camera that gives you by far the best print quality around then the expensive C-3030 digital is the one for you.","Date":"October 23, 2000"}

It allows for many pixel  compressions of jpeg files, all of which are fine quality.  In the 1st 3  weeks, I have taken over 1,000 photos of nature, travel, people, and  objects.  It uses smartcards which are smaller than a matchbook cover and  the 32 meg smartcard allows 330 photos on the SQ2 down to 40 on the HQ  compression. I print on a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet 60R and the quality is  very close to 35mm enlargements from a color lab. I recommend using the  rechargeable batteries since they last many hours then take a quick  recharge. I intend to use this camera to photograph mushrooms in our  forests this August and have total confidence in it. The macro button  allows the lens to be within inches of the subject, and with both manual  and digital zoom enabled, the subject fills the view.  The lens is fast  enough to use in dim light, but the flash is there when you need it.  The  accompanying software is easy to install, easy to use.Caveats: it is  very complex and the accompanying manual is essential. I refer to the  manual daily.  Also, I find it hard to get accustomed to the shutter delay  of a digital cameras after using a Canon A-1 SLR for all these years.  I  should mention that  the 1 1/2 inch LCD monitor cannot be seen when in  direct sunlight, although is perfectly visible when in shadows.  The  biggest flaw is the lens cap which MUST be removed before power is turned  on, and CANNOT be in place while power is on, a very odd flaw, Olympus.","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.  But spending some time to get to know the camera really unlocks its full potential.If you want an excellent digital camera, with excellent image quality, easy to use default settings, and advanced features for even more flexibility, the C3030 is the one to get.","Date":"December 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Serious photographers will love this camera!","Author":"Tool Connoisseur","ReviewID":"R3KLJOVBOCQWV9","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an outstanding camera.  I have been a casual photographer for many years and finally took the digital plunge - the C3030 outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well.  I also read some of the previous reviews, and most of the negative \"problems\" people listed either weren't problems of the camera or were because the person didn't know how to use the camera. When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera.  The C3030 sweeps the field.  Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm.  I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye.  You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures.  It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film.  Low light capability is very good (even better with the new C3040 with its 1.8 lens).  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use.  The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there.  The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots.  The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily.  When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras. The USB transfer rate is much better than a serial cable but I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor.  I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures). It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras.  I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger for only $38 - it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem. I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a single glitch.  One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it.  Again, the new C3040 may take this even one step further.  I also wish the Macro performance was better (closer) but it has been acceptable for most applications.  My next purchase will be the telephoto lens to expand the camera's capabilities. Bottom line is you will love this camera.","Date":"March 22, 2001"}

It has two problems; the first is that darn lens cap gets lost easily, the second is that the view through the viewfinder (not the LCD display) doesn't accurately represent the frame. Both can be solved (one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice) but they detract from an otherwise excellent product.

But I went ahead and bought it, only to discover that the problems didn't exist.It is extremely easy to turn off the flash (just a touch of the obvious button with a flash sign on it), and the Ni-MH batteries that come with the accessory package work just swell.  I was also astonished at how long the batteries that came with the camera lasted and lasted and lasted.  Not a single problem transferring the pics to the puter, either.  I agree that more f-stops could come in handy, but the speed of the lens has worked terrific for me.  Shooting at 2.4 covers a lot of territory, and a lens like that for my Canon would cost me a fortune.  Come to think of it, it has cost me a fortune.  I find myself opting to underexpose shots (when the choice has to be made) because I can always recover a good deal of the \"lost info\" through Photoshop.  But once it's blow out, it's out.  I have to say that going back and reading some of these reviews, now that I have the camera, I'm wondering if I have the same camera as some of these other people:-)All of the good points about this camera have pretty much been covered, so I won't spend time going over them.  I just want to put in my rave about how small it is, the angles available on the lens, and the mind-blowing prints that come out of my Epson 1270 printer.  The tonal range of the colors is so broad (much broader than I've been able to capture on silver halide) that I sometimes put a file through Adobe first, just to bring it down to what is usually expected.  I was very nervous when I bought this camera, thinking that the time for me to own a digital really hadn't come yet, but I was delightfully wrong about that.  Even if I weren't relying on this for professional reasons, I'd want it just for keeping family memories.

Without  reading the manual it took me no time at all to install 4 AA batteries and  I had the camera up and running immediately without a hitch - or breaking  anything.  There was nothing wrong with my remote control or the battery,  and camera view finder works as it should.  The one very minor flaw is that  if you power up the camera with the lens cap over the lens, the zoom lens  tries to push outward causing the a grinding sound.  Its happend to me a  couple times but didn't cause any damage and I'm more careful now to take  the lens cap off before powering up the camera.  This camera is awesome!

This camera excels in all of those catagories.  The instruction book that came with the camera fully explained all of the features.  This camera also will let you control the shutter and aperature settings, this is a must for creating some special effects.  During this past year I have no complaints or problems with the camera.  Now that a year has passed I ask myself would I still buy this camera. Answer:no.  I found that I really could use a zoom, this camera only has a 3 power zoom.  The Olympus C-2100 has a 10 power zoom.  My friend bought one last month and I noticed how much more they got out of their camera.  So if you think you will need a zoom for that special wildlife photo take a look at the Olympus C-2100.  To sumerize: this camera is a very well built and reliable.  Just be sure to compare specs with other cameras on the market.","Date":"July 5, 2001"}
{"Title":"Olympus C3030 is a Great Buy at any price","Author":"Dave Hurd","ReviewID":"R3PZT2K1CNZN04","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this camera now for about 7 months now.  I use a Epson 850 printer with it.  I just love this thing.  It really works great, Pictures are out of this world.  Has a white ballance control which is so importanton digital cameras.  This means you can take color corrected pictures in a Gym, out doors, when clouds come out and indoors with incadencent lights.  It even does moview with sound.  Has many features my 35mm had too so I can take custom pictures.  Buy this camera, it is fun, easy to hold, and carry.  To make this work well I recommend buying these with it at the time of purchase: The olympus 64 meg scan disk not any other manuf.  You can do panormic only with oly.  Buy 8 Rechardable Energizer batteris high energy nic-net-hydride and charger, The olypus CLA1 41mm to 43mm conversion lens adapter, at 24.95 and the step uup ring 43 mm to 55mm , then get a 55mm UV haze filter and 55mm lens cap.  This way the lens on the camera can be protected, and you can add a polarizer filter for really great blue skys. Oh it also opens the door to more b day presents for other lenses olympus has.  Maybe Amazon will some day carry these items to make it all work.  The software that comes with the camera allows wonderful pictures and easy downloads via usb too.  you do not need any other software like other cameras.  I am really in the photography so I bought photoshop ver 5 as well.  I promise you will love this camera as much as I do,  Yes it is only rated number 2 now, but it really should be 1 for normal people like me.  If you are a pro the number 1 may fit, but price and features, this one you can operate without being a pro and get great pictures.  Bottom line buy it, You will be happy.","Date":"January 25, 2001"}
{"Title":"Very good, some annoyances","Author":"Dirkdaddy \"Dirkdaddy\"","ReviewID":"RWDMJPYPK63Q9","Overall":"good","Content":"I won't repeat the positives listed in other reviews, but the main gripe of this camera for me is the need to have to access the menu to change  resolutions, as it will \"default\" to a pretty high res setting,  when most of my shots I really only need the lowest.  A knob would be a  much better way to handle this and some other settings.  I also personally  am a retro guy and would lose the motorized stuff, a nice lever would  suffice and save the batteries.  Same thing for flash, it goes off unless  you turn it off via a menu, and that can ruin a natual light picture if you  forget.  Too much automatic stuff for me to really feel \"as one\"  with this thing, but it does take outstanding pictures.The pictures are  very good with this camera.  Software good, and with a big memory chip it  holds tons of pictures.  Have not tried the movie feature, but a small  speaker or headphone jack would be nice if you did this more than  occassionally.  Also the need to take off the lens cap to avoid motor/gear  damage upon powerup is a annoyance that might be costly to the  operator.S","Date":"September 19, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great second camera","Author":"Robert Field \"leofric1\"","ReviewID":"R3R3KD8UMM7DP9","Overall":"good","Content":"I have just gotten this camera, and already I love it. It works well with the Viking 128MB chip (other than inability to do panorama, not much of a drawback for me) and right out of the box I was able to quickly be pointing and shooting. This is my second digital camera, and I am very impressed with it. The LCD menus are a little tricky to navigate at first, but I am quickly learning where things are. I have experimented with taking pictures at different resolutions and qualities, and also shot some movie clips. I downloaded the results to my computer with little trouble, although I think I would recommend buying either a reader or a PCMCIA adapter for the memory chip, downloading from the camera over it's USB port to the hard drive is a little cumbersome. It takes very nice photos in average lighting without the need for the flash, and I find it very easy to quickly snap a picture, especially of quickly moving subjects like children. It took me a little reading of the manual to discover that the remote only works when the timer is enabled, however once I mastered it I like the 3 second delay so you can hide the remote. I like the ergonomic placement of the controls, I can both hold the camera and work its major functions with a single hand. I didn't see any mention in the manual of the fact that the lens cap has to be removed prior to turning it since the first thing it tries to do is extend the lens barrel. Perhaps the lens cap should snap onto the extensible barrel and not the external housing? These are not major drawbacks but things to bear in mind while learning to use this camera. As a prior user of a digital camera, I think Olympus has done a good job addressing some of the shortcomings of early digital cameras, plus creating a digital camera that looks and feels like the film cameras I have used for years. The touch of the shutter button, picture resolution and recording speed are vastly superior to what I am used to in a digital camera, and compare with a good SLR. All the additional features are there if I want them, but the solid performance of the basic function is a key ingredient. I like to tinker, and having numerous overrides is great, but sometimes I am glad to not to bother with them and just click away, knowing the automatic program is making the right choices for me.","Date":"June 21, 2001"}

After looking at all the reviews I bought the Olympus 3030 Zoom.  Since the new 3040 had just come out (F 1.8 lens compared to the F 2.8 lens on the 3030) the price had dropped dramatically.  I'm amazed by the quality of the pictures that this camera takes.  Even in extremely low light circumstances, I can turn of the flash and get beautiful natural light pictures.  I can only imagine what the F 1.8 lens on the new 3040 model would do!  The menu is easy to use and the camera is delighlfully small.  Manual settings are easy to adjust, but the auto setting mode is dead-on except for difficult shots like those with backlighting.  The video mode also works great and captures both video and sound for short periods (200 seconds on a 64 mb card at HQ resolution).  This is a great camera and the price is also great.  The only downside is a lens cap that is not engineered to stay on the lens....buy a tether unless you want to keep replacing it!","Date":"August 7, 2001"}
{"Title":"Superb Camera!","Author":"Dave","ReviewID":"R1Y8CJEDRRTQFS","Overall":"good","Content":"I have a C-2020, which is a slightly older version of this camera model.  This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it. ... My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter. ... The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those free.  The lens cleaning kit is handy.","Date":"May 26, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great camera with a few minor problems....","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2FAONKEOYV6CU","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera and I am extremely happy with the quality of the images it produces.  If all digital cameras produce images of this quality, I don't see why everyone is waiting to get their first digital camera.The problems that I have with this camera include:The size of the camera is much larger than many other digital cameras on the market.  It is also larger than most current consumer-targeted 35mm and APS cameras.  It is not as large as a 35mm SLR camera however.The lense cap on this camera does not have a strap.  This is a problem that is compounded by the fact that the lense cap falls off relatively easily when pressure is applied to it.  A replacement cap with a strap can be purchased from Olympus. My only other comment is that the camera delays a split-second or so after pressing the shutter button before the image is taken.  This makes the camera very impractical for shooting anything in which a lot of action is involved.  You will likely miss the shot you intended to take.  I do not regularly take these types of pictures, however, so it isn't much of an issue.Overall, I really like the camera.  My replacement cap fixes the strap issue, and I regularly travel with a backpack when I take my camera, so the size isn't a problem.  (A carrying case with a belt loop is also available.)","Date":"December 13, 2001"}

The more expensive non-rechargable Lithiums like it comes with last a very long time.  Great picts too!Customer service at Olympus however is EXTREMELY POOR!  I tried to call them regarding their recommended batteries not working (camera goes dead immediately - low batteries).  I was on hold (Daytime long distance rates!) for over an hour pushing a button every minute or so.  I finally hung up after listening to them tell me how valuable my time was.  So,I tried E-mail.  Got a great generic answer but not about my question.  So, I tried their web site.  It said Ni-MH batteries of 1300 mA or better work.  Mine are 1500 mA and don't.  So, I tried a response to their E-mail.  Yet another useless response that didn't even approach answering my question.  I tried to call them again and got the same crappy treatment again and hung up.  I tried E-mail again and got yet another useless response.The bottom line is that I'll use the $10 each lithium batteries since I get about 250 shots from them.  I won't even attempt to use their support again.  Don't waste your time.  I really like the camera and its a shame that a company that makes such great products can't get a support department that can read or staffed to handle the volume of calls they must be getting.

Also you can use it if you want a larger view than the LCD display, just plug it to your TV, VCR etc. Great resolution for high quality printing.If you have some experience in photography you'll find great all the manual options.","Date":"September 13, 2002"}
{"Title":"Great camera, great price","Author":"Amazon Customer \"dawn9o\"","ReviewID":"R338YZ681CJ23Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using this camera since April 2000 and really enjoy it.  I am not a skilled photographer and still don't know how to work half of the features of this camera but am able to get great shots.  The resolution is great and I love the Camedia software that comes with it.  If you buy this, make sure to buy rechargable NMH batteries and a charger - it uses a lot of batteries.  Also, upgrade the card to get a lot more pictures.  Since you're not wasting film, you'll find yourself taking way more pictures and deleting the ones you don't want later.  Although there are cameras with more mega-pixels out now, make sure you consider the quality of the lense when purchasing a digital camera.  You won't go wrong with Olympus or Nikon, but some of the other brands really don't have the same optical quality and that effects pictures as much or more than just the pixel count.","Date":"November 8, 2001"}

I'm not an expert in digital photography, but I got into 35mm photography back in the '70s. This camera does everything an SLR camera can do and more. Aperture preferred - shutter preferred - spot metering - film speed - exposure bracketing - macro mode - flash control - remote control.... I could go on and on. You've got a dozen picture resolution choices, you can make short movies, you can hook the camera up to the TV and view the pictures, and the quality is sensational. I use the USB cable to upload to my MAC IBook (forget Windows). With my Epson inkjet printer and glossy photo paper I get  8x10s that look better than 35mm glossy enlargements. This is what 35mm photographers used to dream about. I installed the 64MB smart media card and it provides plenty of memory.

This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it.  It can retail up to $200 but I shopped around on-line.  My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter.  I bought it for about $95, which is close to what all those things cost separate.  The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those `free'.  The lens cleaning kit is handy.","Date":"May 26, 2001"}

{"Title":"Arguably the best 3.3 megapixel camera on the market","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R14G9LYPR6UX1S","Overall":"good","Content":"If you're looking for a 3.3 megapixel camera, you'll probably end up choosing from among the Olympus C-3030Z, the Nikon Coolpix 990, Sony DSC-S70 and the Canon PowerShot S70.  All are great products.  After  extensive research, I decided on the Olympus C-3030Z.I suppose the  primary thing to look for in any camera, analog or digital, is image  quality.  In this regard, all of these cameras score very well.  People  seem to say that the Sony produces the sharpest pictures with the most  vivid -- but not necessarily most accurate -- color; the Canon's images are  good but tend to be on the \"cool\" side; and the Nikon and Olympus  are said to produce the most balanced and \"accurate\" images.  It  is hard to say which camera takes the \"best\" pictures: some  people prefer the razor-sharp look of the Sony images, while others find  the Olympus and Nikon images much more pleasing -- it's all a matter of  taste.  But basically, you are going to get superb pictures from any of  these cameras.  Personally, I thought the Olympus and Nikon produced the  most natural-looking and visually appealing images.Image quality aside,  there are basically 3 reasons I chose the Olympus.  FIRST, it has a solid,  rugged feel and its black aluminum body fits naturally into your hand.  (The Coolpix's twist body is, well, cool -- but I found it awkward to hold,  and the Olympus is more compact.)  SECOND, the Olympus uses the tiny  \"SmartMedia\" flash memory card, which I prefer, simply because I  have another device that uses the same format.  (The Sony uses its  proprietary \"Memory Stick\"; the Nikon uses CompactFlash Type I;  and the Canon takes CompactFlash Type I/II, I think.)  THIRD, the Olympus  provides a large number of image resolution storage modes -- you can choose  any combination of picture size (2048x1536, 1600x1200, 1280x960,1024x768,  640x480) and compression level (uncompressed TIFF, jpeg high quality, jpeg  normal), for a total of 15 different combinations.  This flexibility  enables you to choose the resolution/compression appropriate to your  particular intended use of the images.  (By the way, you can fit about 20  images at 2048x1536, normal jpeg compression onto the supplied 16MB  SmartMedia card.)  FOURTH, the Olympus is very fast: quick power-up, very  little shutter \"lag\", and large memory buffer that makes a  \"burst\" or sequence mode possible.  FIFTH, the camera allows you  to make short (up to 3 minutes) movies, with audio.I've had the camera  for about a week now, and I love it.  The pictures are astonishingly good,  and the camera has an intuitive menu system that makes it easy to use.  The  USB connection is a snap, although I use a SmartMedia card reader to  download pix to my computer.  A nice touch: the camera comes with an A/V  cable and a little wireless remote so you can hook it up to your TV, gather  everyone around and gawk at the pictures you just took!All in all, I  feel I made the right choice with the Olympus.  My only criticisms: Olympus  should package this camera with rechargeable NiMH batteries, not the  lithium disposables it comes with; the LCD screen has a bit of a glare  problem in the outdoors; and the optical zoom isn't integrated with the  digital zoom (i.e., the camera doesn't automatically transition to digital  zoom when optical zoom \"runs out\") -- you have to access a menu  to switch from one to the other.  But these are very minor gripes.  I  recommend the Olympus C-3030Z without hesitation!","Date":"July 12, 2000"}

Now this is something, the 135mm, nor i think the medium format can give. BTW, I used the SHQ format, which gives me abt 27 pic, on a 64 MB disk.However, MANY problems were encountered when we were trying to retrieve the pics from the disk. We had specially bought a cable for the transfer of info, but, it seems that, the disk, or the cable is not very stable. Well, You might like me, get many problems when trying to get the pic out from the disk.Such that even when we try to download the pic from the camera, it kept hanging.But the abovementioned problem is or might be a problem with the PC, or (i suspect) the disk, of which i had three, the 16 MB, 32 MB, and 64MB one.another shortcoming of the camera is the inabilty to switch off the flash feature. As during the shoot, when i try to take my model in low light situations, there is NO way i could turn the flash off, as it does not come with that feature, as it is either  in Flash mode or hotshoe to the lightings flash.But overall, it gives gd results for a casual photographer.","Date":"January 8, 2001"}

With small children, that delay is somewhat irritating.Also, the USB drivers do not work with Windows 95.  Amazon's technical description, and Olympus's own web site, claim Windows 95 compatability, but that's only for the serial cable, which isn't included.  And apparently, upgrading to a newer Windows won't help - it must be Windows 98/Me originally installed by the manufacturer.

We had the C-21 and returned it because of the lack of support for W2K and Twain (i.e. no direct picture transfer into W2K or PhotoShop). Reading the reviews this is a general problem for all Olympus cameras except the E-10. Olympus does not intend to fix this. The consequence is that you need to buy additional transfer equipment, use additional software spending extra money and time on getting things achieved. Your option is thus the Nikon and Canon (S-20).","Date":"December 30, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great camera, with one major flaw....","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RIZGFA5XCPVZU","Overall":"good","Content":"My needs in a digital camera were simple, or so I thought. I take a lot of photos, 10-15 or more rolls at a time, which can get very expensive when you take into account the cost of film, developing and printing. It is also  time consuming, as I scan the best ones and print them out as 8 x 10s. Not  to mention a pain, carrying lots of film, lenses, filters, etc. around with  me. My aim was to save money and time, but I didn't want to sacrifice  quality, either.The Nikon Coolpix 990 takes excellent photos, and 8x10s  print very nicely. I added a $400 flash card and that has plenty of room  for lots of pictures (about 80 at fine quality), as poor shots can be  deleted immediately. Downloading the pictures to my laptop is a breeze with  the included usb cable (another review said that cut and paste doesn't  work, but it works fine for me). It's rather heavy on batteries, but once I  switched to rechargeable AAs there was a big improvement. One plus digital  cameras have over film is being able to adapt to current lighting  conditions - no fiddling with filters if taking photos indoors without a  flash, for example. So far, I was very pleased.The major flaw, for me,  came when I used the optional 2X lens (bought at the same time as the  camera). Nowhere in the literature I read before I bought the camera did it  mention that attaching the lens disables the flash. You can't even use an  external flash with it. I take many shots in poor light and at a distance,  and this renders the camera unusable in those circumstances as I am often  also unable to use a tripod. I was more than a little annoyed to find that  after spending close to $2000 total, I still had to take my 35mm camera  with me. I don't know if this is peculiar to the Nikon or common among  digital cameras, but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.Despite this, I  am pleased with the camera, and would recommend it, especially if most of  your photos are taken outdoors or in bright indoor lighting. On my last  trip I shot only two rolls of 35mm film. At this rate the camera will have  paid for itself within the year in film and film developing savings, and  it's worth its weight in gold for the time I save on scanning and  retouching photos.","Date":"June 3, 2000"}
{"Title":"My unbiased opinion on this camera","Author":"Bobbity","ReviewID":"R1RIW454S3GQWC","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, let me say that this camera is incredible, and worth every penny.  I've owned mine for about a week, and I've taken some incredible photos that look like they came out of a magazine (and I'm an amateur at best).Now, let's get realistic about the camera.  I want to provide enough factual information to allow people to make their decisions about whether or not this is the right camera for them.  TheCoolpix 990 has tons of great points.  Most notably, it's 3.34 megapixels (3.24 effective), and thus produces top-quality images with incredible sharpness.  Another thing that was had me sold was the fact that you can go into full manual mode with this camera.  You can choose either shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual (including fully manual focus).  This aspect of the camera should appeal to the professional or \"artsy\" photographer who wishes to customize the camera to get the exact effect they want.After you upgrade the firmware to v1.1, the speed of certain camera operations are a bit faster, but the camera is already originally very fast.  Reviewing photographs in \"Play\" mode is a breeze, and there's not much delay when paging through them.Buy rechargeable NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries and a charger before your camera ships.  The alkaline batteries that ship with the camera will die within hours,guaranteed.  Also, grab the amazing Maha C204F charger.  It allows you to leave the charger plugged in with batteries in it indefinitely, without ruining the batteries at all.  The charger will save you several hundred dollars in batteries.A few drawbacks about the 990 (yes, they do exist): BSS (best shot selection) feature is kind of weak.  It's supposed to let you take 10 shots and it chooses the best (\"the one with the most detail\" I believe the manual says, whatever that means).  On some occasions it has actually chosen blurry photos over the sharp ones.  I've no clue how this works, but Nikon needs to reevaluate this function.  And a warning: don't rely on this camera for good long-exposure shots.  Shutter times of 4 seconds and longer in a dark setting will sometimes show a lot of noise in the photograph.  This is a very noisy camera (audibly and graphically), so try to limit your exposure times.  Also, please note that you will NOT be able to access the \"info.txt\" file that people in other reviews have mentioned.  Yes, the camera saves all photo details (shutter speed, ISO, flash, aperture, etc.) to a file called \"info.txt\", but you CANNOT access the file unless you're using a card reader.  The NikonView software will only let you pull photos from the camera, nothing else.I'll conclude this here because I could rant on for a while on other great points.  The camera is truly amazing, buy it now.  Yes, it has drawbacks, but no camera is perfect--and this one comes pretty close to perfection.  This camera is comparable to the Olympus C3030, so check that out as well.  The features of the C3030 are similar, and in some ways the camera is a little better (the movie mode actually records audio!), and a little worse (uses SmartMedia only).","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

(Gadget junkies can safely ignore this post.)Let me start by saying that this is a great camera.  For my  purposes the 3M pixel resolution is as good as film.  But if you are just  moving over from a 35mm for the first time you are in a for a few rude  surprises.  Some which are endemic to all digital cameras, some Nikon 990  flaws.1. The built in flash is worse than useless for indoor portraits.  The redeye problem is horrendous and unsolvable with the built-in flash.  You'll find yourself buying an external flash (~$150)and bracket (~$50).  Why they didn't put a hotshoe on the camera is beyond me.2. If you  bought the camera for it's 3m pixel resolution you will find the 16M card  supplied as useful as a 16M Windows machine.  You need at least one 128M  card (~$250) which holds ~80 pictures (unless you plan to tether yourself  to a computer.)3. The LCD display and autofocus eat Alkaline batteries  for lunch.  You'll go through a set every 1.5 hours. At minimum you need  rechargable NiCad's.  If you're going to be outdoors for awhile consider a  rechargable external Nicad pack (~$50)4. Shutter lag time seem a lot  longer (worse) than 35mm cameras. About 1 1/2 seconds from when you push  the shutter to when the camera goes \"click\" in auto mode.  Ouch.5. If you are used to \"motor drive\" on your 35mm this  camera will drive you crazy.  There is a 1.5 second delay between photos  for the first two photos and 7 (yes seven!) seconds for the following one.  You simply cannot shoot a series of \"action\" pictures at high  res.6. Oh, hope you didn't expect a carrying case when you bought your  camera.  It's ok because once you buy the external flash and bracket you  need a larger one anyway.7. Getting pictures into your PC via the  compact flash cards are a no brainer if you have either a) USB or b) PCMCIA  adapter for a portable.  In either case you need an compact flash adapter  (~$50 for the PC ~$10 for a portable computer).  Of course you can connect  your camera directly to the computer, but trust me, get an adapter. Make  sure your USB port works before buying the camera.8. Hope you bought an  Epson 1270 or a printer with equivalent quality (~$450)to print your  photos.  If not, get a cheaper (less resolution) camera.9. Get familar  with Shutterfly.com to send photos to your relatives.Summary: Great  camera.  If you're happy taking pictures of the family on a 35mm the  resolution of this camera won't disappoint or embarass you.  However, the  amount of work and manual reading may.  Plan on spending another $500+ for  peripherals.  Learn battery management skills.  Learn how to make every  shot count.","Date":"June 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Follow-up, 5 weeks later..","Author":"CJinJax \"CJ\"","ReviewID":"R38D7QRLZH3Q10","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera now for 5 weeks and like it even better than when I first got it. In my first review (here)I sent my camera out for service, well it only took 8 days from out the door to back in. Nikon service is great and you can track progress along the way via an 800 #.  All the review treads here are pretty accurate for this camera, so I'll keep this basic. The Coolpix 990 is an awesome machine. The pictures are beautiful!  The camera has a swivel joint that allows you to point the lens assembly in one direction and swivel the LCD so you can see it, allowing for holding the camera overhead and focusing in on your subject over crowds. It allows for very creative pictures. I bought extra memory cards and 4 sets of rechargeable nimh batteries that last forever. I get 120+- pics per set of nimh vs 60+- with regular alkali bats, and all I have to do is recharge them to go again, BIG savings.. There are tons of add-on accys. for this camera; zoom lens, filters, external flashes, panorama brackets, you name it. I'm adding lenses and flashes myself. There is a photo book written for the 990 that details the manual settings, with examples, that allows you to take abvantage of the powerful control options built in to this camera.  Your possibilities are enormus. Or you can switch into Auto mode and, point & shoot. There are BB forums dedicated to this camera that have lots information for accy. combos, shooting advice, or knowledge sharing. Before I bought this, I read all the reviews and visited camera stores to physically check all the options available. The 990 has a great feel to it; very solid, an easy menu to navigate, and the control buttons are laid out for a comfortable, quality, feel. Competing cameras are too small for my hands and/or don't take as good a picture. I download my digital pics to on-line developers who mail photo prints back to me. No more bad pictires, and you can't tell the difference between digital vs 35mm film. However, i find that printing the photos on my printer with good paper yields photos that (when framed) rival photo finishing from a developer. This technology is truly amazing. I now find mysely going on lots of picture taking hikes experimenting with the different settings on the camera. I can see the results immediatly in the LCD, learn from my mistakes, delete the bad, make adjustments, and take more good pics -vs- taking a roll of film, getting it developed, spending lots of $ for film and processing, forgetting what settings I did in the first place, and having lots of bad pics. THe savings will pay for the camera and accessories! Oh, and in the 5 weeks I had this camera, I took almost 2000 pictures. Do the math and save the money! (2000 pics / 24 pics per roll = 83 rolls. $15 (film & developing costs) per roll and I would of spent $1,250. and had lots of bad pics to boot over the last 5 weeks. This is Really cool stuff. I don't know what else to say, Great camera, great support from Nikon, and endless resources to improve on your camera skills. You'll never be sorry you got this camera. Once you step into the digital world, you'll never go back to film. Try it, you'll like it.","Date":"October 22, 2000"}

Buchan","ReviewID":"R20UVXP76IJ460","Overall":"good","Content":"I received my 990 about 2 weeks ago, and I take it everywhere with me.  I share the view of many of the reviewers -- you NEED rechargable NiMh batteries (in the first 3 days I went through 3 sets of alkelines) and a bigger memory card (one reviewer says that you can take only 10 pictures at the best quality on the enclosed 16 Mb card -- in fact, ONE picture at the top quality takes about 9 Mb, so you have to download one before you can get another on.)  These petty complaints notwithstanding, the quality of this camera and the control you get are remarkable.  One excellent aspect of the camera is that it's a wonderful camera to learn photographic technique on.  Every photo taken generates a 5 page data file that records the settings of the camera.  Take 4 pictures of a subject at different settings and you can instantly check to see which is the best, and then check what settings you were using -- f. 4.0 at 1/60th of a second, using spot metering, etc.  If I wanted to do this comparison on my 35 mm I would have to take notes of every setting, then shoot a whole roll of film and have it developed, before I could view the pictures side-by-side.

I was hesitant to delve into the digital realm.  Here are the pros and cons of this camera with respect to 35mm SLRs.Pros: No film to deal with.  You can view the results of your photos immediately.  This is great for playing with framing or bracketing (over/underexposing), or other creative things: you can delete the shots that just did not work.  The others you can save for printing or for use on the computer.  This feature is great for any picture you take.  You can see how it turned out.  You will know if so-and-so had their eyes closed or if things were moving too fast for the shutter speed.  I can not stress how convenient this is.  You can delete and then retake bad shots!The lens on this camera tilts every which way.  I use a tripod frequently: I do not have to adjust the tilt angle of the tripod with this camera--I just tilt the camera lens.  The LCD display frees your eye from being stuck to the viewfinder.  This is incredibly convenient.  You can hold the camera at arms-length and still see what's in the viewfinder.Compact size.  The Coolpix is smaller than most SLRs and the memory cards are so much smaller than film.Ability to control \"white balance\".  No more yellow indoor shots.  Cons:  Lack of lens flexibility.  With a SLR you click-and-twist one lens off and click-and-twist a different one on, period.  You have limited screw-on choices with this camera.  Also you have to change the camera's computer settings to use these lenses.  It takes about 30 seconds (or more if you have to drag out the manual) to make a lens change with the Coolpix.  Aperatures are more limited on this camera.  This is especially troublesome for portraits or other photos where a very wide aperature/shallow depth-of-field is often desirable.Color print quality is subject to the quality of your PC printer.  And yes, you can have professional printing done--it's just an extra hassle.  If you have a poor quality printer you may need to buy a NEW printer to get the results you want.I don't know how to explain it, but Coolpix digital pictures are just not the same as film pictures.  Some aspects are better, some seem worse.Battery issues and other issues as mentioned by other reviewers.Conclusion:I WILL NOT get rid of my 35mm SLRs--they cannot be completely replaced by the Coolpix for all situations. I WILL use my Coolpix 990 for many, many snapshots and many kinds of \"creative\" pictures, as well.","Date":"October 6, 2000"}

Bottom-Line for starters, the Nikon-990 makes great  color shots with very (not so suprising) High-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos; as a very picky guy, NIKON is telling the  truth. The 5x7 prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. Since not  many prints are not made larger than 5x7, the superlative colors in this  print size will likely give the Film Camera buffs a challange.

My wife and our 13 year old, carry it on all vacation locations; And when I  don't want to carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly  shocked at the excellent picture quality of the NIKON 990 which also  includes great software, so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily  connect to the yellow video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show  of the days activities. I would recommend purchasing two (2) 80MB memory  card with the camera purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture  opportunities (an 80MB card has room for 50 shots per card at max its  resolution) without having to worry about running out of memory. So for a  day's shooting two 80MB cards will give the equivalent of four (25-shot)  rolls of film.  Since you can erase shots that you don't like, take MANY,  MANY shots and then pick the best ones you like to save, and for printing  or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the evening, I can  copy the photo-files to the lap-top's hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, so there's room for another 50 photos available in preparation  for the next days photo activities. NIKON provides serial, USB cables, and  software to accomplish this simply. Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera  with less than 2,000,000 pixels. (The older models, presently having good  sale prices, are technology of 3 years ago, and you'll wish you spent the  extra money for a higher resolution camera). Since NIKON has been the  camera business for many, many years, its no surprise that they have  created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip) with EXCELLENT Color quality  and detail. This is must have, you'll not be dissappointed. If you're on a  tighter budget check out the KODAK-280 at less than $500 which takes  excellent photos for a 2,000,000 pixel camera. If you have another few  hundred dollars, check out the SONY or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers,  which produce actual photo quality continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes;  These printers are not dot-matrix's with all the little dots. The camera  and the printer makes for a great combo family gift for under $1,500, that  anyone in the family can use without having to even turn on a computer, as  the printer prints directly off the camera memory card. Don't make yourself  craze, since DIGITAL Cameras are slightly different than a typical film  point-and-shoot cameras, be sure to read the instruciton booklet, before  pushing all the buttons. The documentation NIKON provides is very easy to  understand. So take it slow when you open the Box for the first time. It's  intuitive to use, after the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going  back to the booklets. My wife and 13 year old son love this camera (as do  I)and they have no trouble dealing with the camera's features, which are  exhaustive.  This 3.340,000 pixel camera is one of the best I've tested  yet. ONE more point, the camera can twist at its middle (permitting the  lens to point up or down, with the LCD Pannel staying directly in-line with  your eyes) which is an amazing engineering idea which gives the  photographer a whole new perspective for taking pictures without having to  have the camera pressed against your face. The LCD screen is bright even  out doors.  JLW/2000/08/25.","Date":"August 25, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera with some flaws","Author":"George P. Hatzigiannis DMD, MD","ReviewID":"R321W5WTW2OODP","Overall":"good","Content":"I owned this camera for about 4 months, and in the time took over 1000 photos with it (yeah, I know, too much free time!). I used the photos for on-screen presentations, as well as 8x10\" printouts. The camera takes just incredible photographs, with accurate colors, and very sharp definition. Here are some other points I saw:*autofocus was fairly quick during the day, but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light* flash: powerful, but nothing you do can get rid of red-eye in virtually any shot (red-eye reduction mode is useless)*camera can store photos in separate folders, which is useful for multiple occasions*no support for Microdrive is a fatal flaw*metering system is extremely accurate; found virtually no need to use the spot meter*macro ability is second to none*for dentistry, takes wonderful intraoral photos, utilizing the chair light and the built-in flash; not terribly good, though, if you want to focus on ONE tooth, since the flash will wash things out. The resolution is good enough, though, that you can focus on a quadrant, take the shot, and crop it later.Overall, found it to be the perfect camera, minus the red-eye problems and lack of microdrive support. So I sold it and bought a Canon Powershot G1 (review forthcoming)...","Date":"December 2, 2000"}
{"Title":"A change of heart, nothing finer than the 990.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RM96GJETJ2LX9","Overall":"good","Content":"Keeping this short and sweet (well shorter than most I hope), I just wanted to share with any person interested in this camera some valuable information to consider while shopping for a digital camera. About 4-5 months ago I gave my Nikon 950 to my better half itching to jump on the 3.3 Mp bandwagon. Right off the bat there were only 2 cameras to consider (the Sony DSC-S70 and the Nikon 990), all other 3.3's were just not up to par with these two. After a month of research I decided that the S70 would be the better of the 2 because of the sleek point and click design and sony's proprietary memory stick. Both camera's are true 3 megapixel cameras unlike the predecessor DSC-505V, both cameras have viewfinders (a must-have for day photography), and both cameras deliver exceptional pictures. But with the far stylish look of the S70 at $200 less the S70 was my choice at the time. I then spent the next 2 months trying to locate the camera in stock and at a good price, fortunately Amazon began to sell DCs which allowed me to start pricing cameras again. However, the Sonys were all backordered, which ended up to be a blessing in disguise. A few weeks later a relative purchased the 990 and allowed me to tinker with it. Still a believer on the S70 I was reluctant in accepting the bulkier design of the camera, but after a few hours I found the 990 to be the true champ of the 3.3's. During my tinkering I found a couple facts to consider for both cameras: 1. Both cameras come with an inadequate amount of storage, so getting extra memory is a MUST. 2. 1 battery (or 4 for the Nikon) will not do the job while you are on a trip. 3. Zoom on both are extremely low, so they will never truly replace a 35mm. Taking those into consideration along with the offer Amazon had on the 990, it was hands down the better of the two for these reasons: 1. The 990 uses CF cards which are a standard in several cameras unlike the proprietary Memory Stick, also you get 16mb with the 990 compared to the 8mb with the S70. 2. A 64mb stick costs as much as a 96mb CF card. 3. The S70's memory write times were significantly slower than the 990 (due to the memory stick again). 4. The 990 uses AA batts which can be found anywhere. 5. The Manual Options for the 990 gives the photographer so much control over their photo conditions. 6. The 990s swivel design is fabulous, something totally impossible on the S70 unless your workaround happens to be your \"swivel-neck\". Now does this make the 990 a great point&click? Probably not (dont get me wrong, the 990 is an unbelievable on its \"Auto\" mode) you will thoroughly enjoy the camera more because of the configurable nature of the camera, if you plan to truly take digital photography seriously then this is your camera. Also, a few quirks you need to adjust to with the camera (all DCs have them, but these I found were actually minor since you can find workarounds for them): 1. Batteries, the 990 inhales them... get a set of at least 4 to a recommended 8 rechargables, they cost a lot, but you will need them, the NiMH rechargers work great. 2. Get at least 32-64mb of memory, 16mb = 1 picture at the 990's absolute highest setting. 3. Upgrade the firmware to 1.1 when you get the chance, the autofocus upgrade is noticable.. quite noticable. 4. The software with the camera is weak, very weak (basic app to download pictures), get a picture editing package. 5. Built-in flash not the best for distant shots, which can be compensated with an external flash. 6. Red-eye is there and red-eye suppression doesn't do the trick most of the time, but get a red-eye removing pen at your local camera shop, they work wonders. Like I said, every camera has quirks, but if I listed the quirks I discovered about the S70, I would never end this review. Finally, I assume that you can guess which camera I finally purchased off Amazon. I've been messing with it for this past week and I am now a Nikon believer (was one with the 950, but more so with this camera). I'm so eager to take pictures with it these holidays and hope that if you purchased the 990, that you find what I wrote true to your experiences as well. To those who are considering, I hope you find what I wrote informational. Merry Christmas everyone!! :)","Date":"December 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"I really like this camera, good choice for ambitious amateur","Author":"J. G. Heiser","ReviewID":"RHPM27504TOKY","Overall":"good","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.  All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution & quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely. The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.  It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Zrich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.  I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low....  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.  It's a winner!","Date":"December 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Digital Camera!","Author":"David Richardson \"Oakport\"","ReviewID":"R2CUBPE3RZHIL3","Overall":"good","Content":"I have read, with interest, most of the reviews of this product. This is my third Coolpix Digital Camera. (Coolpix 900 and Coolpix 950.) Each generation has been a significant improvement over the previous generation, and, from my perspective, well worth the upgrade. I agree with much of the other reviewers comments:1. Definitely purchase NIMH rechargeable batteries. They last much longer than anything else. I keep 3 extra sets with my camera at all times.2. It was necessary for me to not only have a larger CompactFlash Card (64MB and 96MB) but to have two or three extras. It is an issue like carrying a couple of extra rolls of film. However, since the CompactFlash Cards are almost infinitely reusable, the more pictures you take, the quicker you recover your costs.3. Whereas the 990 takes great pictures by itself, you can improve them significantly by using a photo editing program such as Photoshop. I have found this to be true for both print film and slides. You get a much better picture when scanned and edited in your computer.4. If the quality of the final prints is important, some form of dye sublimation printing process is essential to avoid the pixelation inherent in (particularly older) inkjet technology. Epson's Photo printers seem to have solved the problem, but I prefer the dry media printers. I use an Alps MD 5000, which unfortunately is no longer available in the USA.When it comes to the drawbacks noted by several of the other reviewers, I believe familiarity with the camera and the digital system of photography will alleviate most of them. One of the reviewers seemed to have had a defective product, rather than anything inherently wrong with the 990.The only real complaint I have about the 990 (and I believe it is a problem with any digital camera that depends on an LCD view screen) is that it is very difficult to see the images in bright sunlight. I think Nikon should design a hood to shade the screen. I have done makeshift things without great success.Overall, I am well pleased with my 990. I rarely use my Nikon film cameras, and then usually for long lens shots. I can't recommend this camera too highly.","Date":"October 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Camera - Low Quality Support","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RXD8WQRPF819X","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera just arrived from Amazon to me yesterday.Since I have used and owned several high-end consumer digital cameras I note the following should others be interested in this camera.1.  This camera is for a true  enthusiast, a person testing high end consumer digital cameras before  buying the professional line for business, or for I guess, a person who  just has the bucks to have the latest.2.  I love it since I am  constantly imaging events or children and need to have a camera that is  fast (does not take for ever for it to focus and capture the image from the  time you click the camera to the time it captures the image to put on disk.  It records to disk (memory/digital film - whatever you want to call it),  It needs to have capacity for high storage, fast downloads.3.  The  camera itself in comparison to other cameras of this style and caliber is  quite easy to use.  (The swivel feature is really nice to get those angles  that are harder to get)4. Minimal weight and size for its features.  Nice.5.  Getting the images to computer uses the drag and drop concept  of windows.  Since at the point of arrival, this camera did not have its  software ready to make upload easy like most cameras have.  Per the note  packaged in the camera, it will not be available for Win 98 users till June  2000ish.The drag and drop is not intuitive.  You should have reasonable  windows knowlege to figure out that you need to open both the Nikon viewer  and a window set on the location of where you want to put the images.  DRAG  and DROP.  Copy and paste does NOT work.But once you get the idea using  the camera with USB cable is so fast in comparison to that of serial....  this flies. 6.  Though they do now have 24/7 cs....I was on hold for 2  hours 10 minutes before the line was cut off.  Though I had them on speaker  phone, was able to have dinner and dress the kids for bed, it was  annoying.7.  So, since Nikon service is rather poor (unless you are  talking about the sales dept), I reccomend that if you buy this camera, and  are spending this kind of money on a camera, you need to have: good  digital camera knowlege/experience, very good windows and windows imaging  knowlege, wants to be able to have high quality prints made when that  \"oh so special\" image is actually captured to disk and a really  trustworthy dealer.","Date":"May 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 990: Sophisticated Digital Point & Shoot","Author":"Gary W. Sanders","ReviewID":"R1O0L31GWEZZPZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have used Nikon 35mm cameras for many years.  I have also bought many point & shoot cameras.  When digital point & shoot cameras exceeded three megapixels, I learned I could get sharp 8x10 prints on my inkjet printer that came close to the quality of 35mm 8x10's.  The Coolpix 990 has many of the same features as its 35mm counterparts.  For example, it has similar metering patterns: matrix, center-weighted, and spot.  It also has selectable focusing and spot metering areas, just like the F5 and F100 35mm cameras.  It also has flash compensation, exposure compensation, fill flash, red-eye reduction, and slow sync flash, just like the 35mm \"big boys\".  If all this sounds complicated, trust your instincts.  This is a camera aimed at experienced photographers, or those who are interested in a fully adjustable point and shoot digital camera with all the bells and whistles.  A nice feature of this camera is that it also has an \"automatic\" mode, which makes most of the decisions for you.  That mode yields acceptable results, and is a nice way to get used to the camera.  I would recommend this camera to someone who is very interested in top quality digital photography.  With the automatic mode, even the more timid or inexperienced members of the family can use it and get good results.  One final bit of advice: Expect to buy additional Compact Flash storage media cards.  I carry two 128MB cards with me and can shoot all day without worries.  Good Luck!","Date":"October 20, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 990 -- Six Months and Six Thousand Pictures","Author":"Michael Gordon","ReviewID":"R2RBLNG12ICO5A","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought from Amazon.com and it has paid for itself many times over.  I have made over 6,000 photographs with it.  I carry plenty of battery and memory (two sets of NiMH AA batteries and a Digipower battery pack), two 32 mb, one 64 mb, and one 80 mb memory card.  ON a shooting trip I take about 400 pictures or more per day.  Quality is excellent; I have made full page, full bleed color brochures with it.  Most of the time I use XGA mode, high quality compression, 400 kilobyte per picture.  For pro work I use full size high quality, but still JPEG, 1 megabyte per picture.  It is exceptionally well suited to smoothly textured subjects (sky, water, glass) where the lack of grain is paramount.  It is somewhat less suited to intricate subjects (forest).  The swivel LCD screen makes formerly difficult shots easy (low or high viewing angles).  Macro focus is excellent.  Color balance and exposure control very good; you will want to edit most of your shots in a good bitmap editor (Corel Photopaint for instance) to rotate upright and equalize color.  You can also apply a \"film-like\" s-curve adjustment to make it look just like film if you wish.","Date":"January 10, 2001"}

Out of the box, you just put the batteries and flastcard in, turn it on and, point and shoot.  It's that easy.  USB image transfer to computer is easy, just drag and drop. But the software included isn't that great, Nikon had to send me a backordered disk and the catalog software is a hassle to figure out.  I just want to snap pictures. The camera eats batteries, about 60 shots (half with flash)per set of 4 bats, so get some rechargables, nimh are the best. And get an extra memory card too.. I edit shots in PhotoShop or MS Picture-it then print them out.  Great resolution and color.  Wonderful pictures. Bye bye 35 mm film. Now the negatives.  My camera broke today, 8 days out of the box.  I have to send it to the service center.  Tech support must be hearing a lot of the same thing, (wont shut off, zoom clicks, no menu differientation) its like the program shorted out or something. SO am I satisfied? YES!  I don't want a refund or another camera (I looked at them ALL), just the camera fixed and back in my hands.  I highly recommend the camera to all, it's a great camera, easy to use, takes great pics, and I can do a lot of advanced stuff too, but not til it's back from the shop. Happy snapping.

{"Title":"Nikon has a winner, IF you have a card reader.","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R2LJKORGDODZR","Overall":"good","Content":"Out of fairness to Nikon, I need to provide a sequel to my previous critical comments. When used with a CF card reader to communicate with your computer, this system is nothing short of astounding. This is the first digital camera I have used, and I expected to get a semi-toy that mainly  lived because of the gee-whiz digital 'film'. This is no toy. It's got most  of the features of high-end 35mm cameras, and is a legitimate professional  tool. Of course, its 3.3 megapixel resolution can't compete with properly  exposed 35mm film, but for many applications it is enough. I printed a  full-size 8 1/2 x 11 page, and the detail was pretty respectable. The range  of focus and exposure control options (including, of course, fully manual)  make this a camera that can handle many of the oddball situations where  I've had to burn lots of Polaroid film to get the setup right. It's a shame  that Amazon's catalog pages fail to indicate how limited this system can be  without the extra-cost card reader (not a lot of money, but it also burns a bunch of  time to try to figure out how to get by with the cables it's shipped with).","Date":"May 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Superb!","Author":"R. Lade \"prophoto\"","ReviewID":"R1ZPTT8QU3NM53","Overall":"good","Content":"Having been a Nikon user for 95% of my photographic career, the 990 was a natural purchase.  This is a wonderful camera in every fashion!  It's made in true Nikon tradition--durable, dependable, and simple to use.  Does it do what my D1 will do--no it won't, but it wasn't intended to.  However, it does share many similar functions to the D1 or a well-equiped SLR.  You have the option of aperture or shutter speed priority, program (and program shift), as well as full manual control.  And if you use the LCD panel for viewing, you do have a digital SLR of sorts, so you can use filters (such as a polarizer) and others.  So you do have a very capable and creative tool with this camera.  My main purpose for buying this camera was to have a digital \"point-and -shoot\" that wasn't as cumbersome as the D1 or an SLR and didn't require carrying around an array of lenses but still gave me some of the SLR tools that would be useful.  In other words, this camera allows me to do digital imaging and keep it simple.My only bone of contention with the 990 is the flash.  Expect to remove red-eye from 90 percent of your people-pictures.  And the red-eye reduction feature doesn't help much.  The flash is just too close to the lens--period!  I bought the flash bracket so I can use my Nikon SB-28 flash and that proved to be a flawless combination.  The only problem with that arrangement is that it sort of defeats the point-and-shoot purpose to a small extent.  The only other issue would be seeing the LCD panel in bright light outdoors, but I imagine that's probably a typical problem with most of these cameras.  But here's a little tip.  Take a piece of black posterboard, fashion it into a square tube the size of the LCD panel, put some narrow strips of velcro on it and around the LCD panel and voila--a viewing hood that works like a charm!  Also, as is probably also typical for these cameras, don't expect long battery life if you use the LCD panel all the time.  Get some rechargeable metal hydroxide batteries.  The life span is far, far longer.  The Everyready system works very well.  Aside from that, for general shooting outdoors and indoors, I love this camera.  I have to be honest and state that I didn't do a lot of comparing.  I had (and still have) the Coolpix 800 and loved it as well, and again, being a Nikon freak, there wasn't any indecision here.  I simply wanted a \"point-and-shoot\" digital that had more capabilities than the 800 had.  If I'm doing some really serious shooting for publication or exibition, then it's time for the D1 or the old faithful SLR and slide film.Don't think twice if you're considering this camera.  It's top-notch all the way!","Date":"February 8, 2001"}

The only thing I miss is a pentaprism SLR viewfinder, being able to use my Nikkor lenses and just a little faster action. But, that's begging for a Nikon D1 at 5x the price and 3x the weight (without a lens). The Coolpix 990 has a sharp 3x zoom lens, rendering 9 Megabyte images from moderate wide-angle to short telephoto with the choice of a quick all-auto shooting mode or a fully customizable auto/manual shooting mode. Also you can choose between previewing the image through the fast real zoom rangefinder or the near-100% digital color LCD monitor, plus you can watch the settings in the simple LCD symbol display or complete data superimposed over the color LCD image.I like to let the camera choose all settings for quick, instantly ready snapshots, or use any of the multiple features to get the best possible semi-automatic or manual exposure when time and needs are suitable.Images look great on a 8x10 \" ink jet print, I have even sold a picture for a graphics trade magazine cover, and it was a wide-format original which had to be cropped.The main point, with Nikon Coolpix 990, you always have the choice.

The resolution of pictures taken with a Nikon Coolpix 990 is indeed extremely high.  This camera has three \"resolution levels.\"  I usually use the middle level: the \"Normal\" mode.  The resolution of pictures taken in this mode is very, very good.  I would not hesitate to make 8\" by 6\" prints of such pictures.  Rarely do I use the \"Fine\" mode (there is really no reason to use it in my view). In the \"Normal\" mode, I believe that I get about 20-25 pictures on my memory card.  For my purposes that is adequate. Of course, my initial approach has proven too simplistic:  there are other factors (other than resolution alone) that you should consider before buying a digital camera! If are thinking of buying a digital camera to photograph subjects that move quickly and erratically (such as a young child), you will soon realize that taking digital pictures is not ideal.  While I understand that the Nikon is relatively quick compared to other digital cameras, it still takes a fraction of a second to actually \"take\" the picture after pressing the button.  So you end up with a lot failed pictures that would have been great if taken with a conventional camera.  The menu (for deleting pictures and other functions) is very intuitive and I believe it allows even those of us who don't read the owners manual cover-to-cover (like me) to get a lot out of the camera. I have one problem with the camera that is of a more serious nature:  often I take a picture that will cause the camera to \"crash\" when downloaded or viewed on the display (I often use the useful \"slide show\" feature).  It generates an error message and so far hasn't affected the other pictures on the memory card (but I have not been able to recover the subject picture).  I don't know if this is a problem with the memory card or with the camera - but it is annoying.  Without this problem, I would have given this camera a 5 star rating... I like the ergonomics of this camera and it feels like it's solidly constructed.  Rechargeable batteries (AA) are the way to go (they last surprisingly long).  Knowing this camera's features and limitations, I would still buy this camera again...","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

One of the things I disliked about my Coolpix 950 is that it has a non-changeable default on the zoom which zooms all the way out when it is turned on. The 990 lets you decide.  I use a  MAC G3 powerbook and found that downloading images by cable to be slow and  cause frequent crashes and lost images. A PCMCIA reader for $15 solved this  problem and speeded up the process.  LCD is still terrible in daylight  and no hood is being made available.  Accessory lense adapters still  block the optical view finder.  Card slot is located on side now which  is great when using a tripod or copy stand.  This camera works great  for copywork!  Rechareable NMH batteries or Quantum pak are the way to  go for power.

I'd like to think that I understand photography better than most folks.  When I first bought the camera I had a bit of buyers remorse.  I'll admit it was a bit expensive toy purchase for me.  After using it for 3 mos I am blown away with the images I capture. I've taken pictures with it that have been published.  I would repeat the purchase in an instant.  Everyone writes the same stuff in their reviews so this is about what to get and not get with the camera.This camera has a lot of features and the documentation is just OK so get the Nikon Digital Photography book.  You may actually understand what you are doing then.  GET 2 sets of NiMH rechargable Batteries!  This camera eats regular batteries for lunch.  The NiMH batteries last longer than regular batteries. Get a bigger memory card. 80M will give you about 100 pictures in medium resolution.  Get a fast card 8X or better. Don't be cheap here.  The faster cards will cut down your cycle time between photos.  Something to think about as you are missing shots waiting for the camera to load the image you shot. In theory these things last forever, so buy the best. Get a card reader with your camera.  It will dowmload in a fraction of the time camera direct will download. Get the 24mm wide angle adapter lens.  I promise you will love it and use it all the time. I have two cases for my camera.  One that holds just the camera and my 24mm lens. I take it with me when I want to grab some quick shots.  The other case holds my battery charger and other lenses in addition to the camera.  It's overkill but it works for me.  Whatever you do PROTECT your camera! I don't think I'd buy the 3X extender again.  I don't use it that often and it was expensive.  \"Wider is better\" If you are in low light you will want to get a tripod and have your subject stand still.  If you can manage that you can get shots with hardly any light. Good luck and enjoy your camera!","Date":"May 2, 2001"}
{"Title":"There's Simply No Comparison!","Author":"cinemagirl","ReviewID":"R36Q5MKIHSI5GT","Overall":"good","Content":"I started researching digital cameras nearly a year ago, as I had decided a while back that I wanted a digital camera. As an amateur photographer, I was looking for something reliable that produced excellent photographs. There were a plethora of websites containing opinions on which camera to purchase; I even took a few compatibility tests, and most of the results named the Nikon Coolpix 990 as my best bet. After asking others for their opinions, I received an overwhelmingly positive response to this camera. There were  a few people who deemed the Coolpix 990 too pricey and convoluted, and I did consider getting some other less expensive cameras (like Fuji and Kodak), but my propensity for top-of-the-line items ultimately won. I purchased the 990 here on Amazon, and it arrived in a couple of days (thanks for the speedy service, Amazon!). There were several fears, however. A few people have said that such a high-end camera was not exactly necessary, that a cheaper camera would do the job. Initially, I had only planned to use this camera to post photos on websites, but I then realised that if Im going to spend a few hundred dollars on a big toy, I might as well have it do everything (namely 8 x 10 prints).Having just returned from a short vacation in London, England, I can now accurately attest to the 990s excellence. I took this camera everywhere, and I soon abandoned my camera bag and I hung it around my neck for easy access. The tube, Parliament, Tower Bridge, pubs, restaurants, streets, shopping centres....I went to many places and took several photographs along the way. Before this trip I had really only used this camera for a few photos around my town, but now that Id taken it on vacation, I have a more lucid perception. This camera is phenomenal, and although I cannot ramble on in technical terms, I can articulate the ease with which I took photos, the terrific quality of the prints, and the sheer professionalism of it. Some specific points:* The LCD is nicely-sized and clear, although I would stock up on NiHM batteries. I played around with the menu settings for such a few minutes, and the batteries completely drained. During my trip I shut off the screen to conserve the batteries. * The swivel lens is convenient and affords a lot of versatility. Some people consider it odd, but I thought it was a nice touch.* 16 MB memory card included in the box. Instead of buying more cards, however, I purchased the IOMEGA Pocketzip (formerly Clik! Drive) in order to dump my photos onto it during my trip. Highly recommended procedure!* Some red-eye when you use the flash, but I've stopped using it altogether, as I prefer the soft effect of photos without it. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with this marvelous camera. I take it everywhere now, and I cant imagine being as happy with anything else (until the next model comes out, of course). Albeit expensive, it is worth every penny. The photographs are amazing, the settings numerous so that you can customize it to your needs, and the convenience priceless!","Date":"December 17, 2000"}

Of course these are the most important aspects of a digital camera. Aside from that, other nice tricks include being able to swivel the lens and take mpeg movies. Some complaints you should be aware of:- Not having a case seems chintzy when you're paying over $800 for a camera. - Bad red-eye even with that mode turned on. Lens is probably too close to the flash on the body. - Settings are not for the amateur. You need to spend a lot of time with the manual before using the complicated menus. I've used the \"restore settings\" button more than once. Don't pay for settings you don't use! - Flash seems weak, or I haven't found the right exposure+flash balance for taking shots in imperfect light from more than 12 feet. - Get a large flash card or don't bother. With \"normal\" photos in 3.3 megapixel cameras weighing in at 750K+, you should have at least a 32MB card. Over 100MB cards are really where digicams come into their own. - Flash card readers are also nice. The Coolpix USB is fine, but if you have 50 pictures it can still take a while. (Have to download new software for Win2000, a little annoying.) - The mpeg movies it produces are 40-second silent films, no sound! (Unless I've really gotten screwed up by the settings...) - The AC adapter is definitely worth it if you use the camera frequently, and you will.","Date":"November 24, 2000"}

I'm updating this review because of the enjoyment I get from this camera and all the support I recieved from other \"posters\" as I researched prior to my purchase. If you consider this product, you'll LOVE your purchase.I snapped a lot of pics with this thing and print out the good shots on my printer for framing. Believe me, I've taken lots of shots, but only a few \"really good\" ones. BUT, my technique gets better all the time. This \"learning curve\" would of sent me to the poor house if I used my 35mm Nikon and had to develop all those rolls of film.  Digital is \"free\" after you make your initial investment in the gear.  I bought a pile of add-on lenses and flash assys. for the camera to get the most out of it.There is a great E-Book by Peter iNova \"Mastering Nikon Digital Cameras\" ($50)that is a detailed 990 camera; instruction manual - photo techniques - editing & printing tutorial that is the PERFECT companion to your 990 purchase. The E-Book is interactive and will help you MASTER the 990 to its potential. Get this if you get the camera, i believe this is a MANDATORY purchase. If this was out when I bought the camera, I'd of saved 3 months off my learning curve.Well, not many more good things to say that haven't been said before.

Also, with a little photo-editing you can turn almost any picture into a winner.  This lets you to turn pictures that would otherwise end up at the bottom of a shoebox, into family treasures.

I now have a furniture store which both my wife and I own.  We also have a crew that builds custom furniture. For our web site we needed good photos.  We have designated an area in the store mainly for photography. We chose the Nikon 990 coolpix digital camera because of the 3.34 megapixels and the reputation of the Nikon name. We purchased the camera when it first became available,I have had it since sometime in July 2000.  It took me  several weeks to learn the camera.  The documentation is very difficult to follow.  However I feel that I know the camera well enough now to use it to its fullest extent, we are getting incredible results. The Express photo program that comes with the camera is very good. I am able to correct the flower pot shape from looking down on the subject and crop for the desired results. In one previous ratings red eye was mentioned, and I also found that no matter what you do you get some serious red eye problems. In another program (Adobi Photo Shop) I zoom in on an eye so that the eye fills the entire monitor screen then I take all the red squares and turn them into the color I want, with amazing results.

I agree with others that the 990's menu system takes some time to master if you really want to maximize the potential of this camera.  You can use the auto mode to take great pictures right out of the box though.  This camera, just like the 950 is a hog for batteries.  I like the fact that I can carry regular AA batteries as an emergency backup, but better yet, get two sets of rechargeables.  I use the camera to take \"crude\" pictures of radiographs and intraoperative pictures. The ability to select for light source makes this much easier.  It does a very good job for the radiographs and takes excellent surgical pictures (great color accuracy).  The flash unit is fairly weak so consider trying to get the elusive external flash adapter (hard to find in stock).  That's my only complaint with these Nikon digital cameras.

They just don't cooperate.I've used an Olympus  C2000-Z for the past year. I found the pictures to be of somewhat  consistent quality - some better than others - maybe 3-5 out of a  \"roll\" (16MB smartcard) to be worth sharing with my family.I bought the Nikon 950  before I got the Oly - and had to return it out of frustration with the  user interface and the inability of the camera to obtain a focus lock - and  take the picture.And that's if the camera didn't lock up. Heck - it's  not Windows. You shouldn't need to \"reboot\" your camera. In a  week, the 990 locked up (requiring me to take the batteries out) five or  six times. The 950 was just as bad.I found a better UI with the 990 -  but similar frustrations with focus. In low light situations, you better be  on a tripod, and have a flashlight handy to let the camera get a focus  lock. From what I understand, there are cameras coming out (Fuji has one)  that have what SLR owners are used to - a low light focus assist  illumination lamp. This camera desparately needs one.If you need to take  a picture of something moving - get a focus lock BEFORE your subject gets  into view - or the camera becomes very confused, and you're left staring at  the viewfinder's blinking green \"I'm not ready to take a picture - I  can't focus\" light. And your subjects look at you, smiling politely...  \"Did you get it?\"\"No.\"\"Boy, that camera is  slow, huh? I thought the box said 'superhigh performance'?\"\"Ha  ha. Very funny.

{"Title":"great camera, a few small flaws.","Author":"Charlie Wallace","ReviewID":"R3F4E9CR7Q523M","Overall":"good","Content":"overall i've been pleased with the 990, the only drawbacks are(1) disappointed in the manufacturers claims about standard AA battery life, usually 15mins is average, not the hour and half claimed. NiMHs are a must, I use 1600maH which usually lasts 12 hours at least. Get real nikon, ship at least nicads, sure its a cost issue, but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for 15 mins or less. (2) The manual is weak, but is typical of translated manuals. 3) accessories are hard to get hold of, and the remote release is expensive (although its feature loaded) an IR or RF based remote would be nice, most other camera makers offer them. (4) suffers from red eye a lot. (5) low quality software on the PC, even lower on the MAC, crashes often on win2k, even after the update to camera firmware and PC software, crashes on first time use everytime. (6) menu access is slow, camera could do with a faster cpu, latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better. (7) one very small thing that would only affect a few people, is the inbuilt IR filter for the lens, which means you can't do the near IR style photography thats popular with other digicams.other than those small quibbles, its generally an excellent camera, its a lot of fun to use.  Once you are setup with NiMHs and a decent sized CF card its easy sailing, we've had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it. Pictures taken are great, the jpg compression levels work well,the low is very low quality suitable for web pictures, but the high end is good, and the highest setting, with no compression is excellent.","Date":"January 22, 2001"}

I specifically wanted full manual control and the ability to use an external flash (the internal flash is almost useless). The large handgrip is a welcomed change from most other digicams out there.  It feels nice and solid in your hand while the no-slip surface does its job admirably.  The shutter release button is solid and the mode jog dial is placed perfectly.  The user interface could benefit from minor usability improvements, but for the most part is easy to use and learn in seconds without consulting the manual.  And to echo what everyone else mentions, battery life lasts me about 40 shots with the monitor and flash turned off.  I take along a spare set of AA batteries for short outings.  For longer outings, I mount a DigiPower DPS9000 external battery pack into the tripod mountOverall picture quality is good, but not to the level of my 35mm film cameras under moderate scrutiny.  For web content, picture quality is awesome, though.  Resolution and sharpness are perfectly acceptable for 4x6 prints.  Nice to have the 3:2 ratio to let you print uncropped 4x6 images.  Macro capabilities are great.Since I prefer to print my personal images, I feel the Coolpix's weakness is in its color reproduction.  Photos printed on a Fuji Frontier 370 system seem to lack a certain saturation or 'punch' in various colors - things seem to be on the dull or compressed side and not very vibrant, even if the original scene was.  This is especially noticeable when you hold a digital print next to a film print when both have used the same exposure and focal length and have been printed on the same machine.Sure, I can spend time in PhotoShop adjusting curves and levels, but that's more time consuming than it's worth if you ask me.  For a few photos, no big deal.  But if I just shot 50+ images that are keepers, I'm not going to spend countless hours tweaking each one.  I found that a semi-decent shortcut is to get the ICC profile for my target printer and batch up all the images in PhotoShop to have the profile applied automatically.  I then spend $0.29/print at my local camera shop getting them printed.  Inexpensive, fast, sharp, and durable -there's no way I can print at home at that price or time savings, and I doubt anyone else can.PROS:Sharp images (provided you keep the sharpness setting on Auto)Easy user interfaceInexpensive on the used marketDecent build qualityCONS:Condensed color rangeSlow to focus and fire shutter (2-3 sec.)Supplied software is almost uselessViewfinder shows too little of actual image (85%?)","Date":"June 5, 2003"}

I've previously been using a JVC digital camcorder (which flaked out on us - if you ever get one, be sure to get a good extended warranty to cover complete equipment failure), so I find myself comparing the Coolpix  to the camcorder.  Picture quality on the Coolpix is excellent, although it  seems to not perform too well under low lighting (at least, not without  using the flash).  The optical zoom isn't that spectacular, either (only  3x).  Daylight pix are great though, sharp and clear, and there are none of  those JPEG \"artifacts\" you see from cheaper cameras.  I found  the Coolpix to be quite usable right out of the box.  It comes with 4 AA  batteries, which don't seem as short-lived as I'd been fearing. Then again,  I'm more used to the camcorder whose battery only lasted 15-20 minutes, so  the Coolpix seems far superior there already.  I did, nonetheless, order a  set of NiMH batteries + charger.  Save your money on the extras, though  - if you're only taking photos for the web, you probably don't need a  bigger compact flash card - the 16Mb card included with the camera will  hold 40 \"basic\" quality images, which are 2048x1536 pixels.

And the results I get are much better than before.No matter what I ask of this camera, it does the business, makes me feel like more of a pro than I am.I love the ability to twist the lens and look down on the screen; all cameras should be like this.You'll need to spend quite a bit of time getting used to the many different screens if you want to use anything other than auto. It's all a bit complicated, but you eventually get used to it.I would have preferred a wider wide-angle too, and the on-camera flash is nothing special. And it EATS batteries! Also, my example occasionally refuses to switch; the only way is to open the battery cover. It's not exactly small either...BUT the pictures it takes can hardly be faulted - even blown up to A3 size!","Date":"October 23, 2000"}

I've done professional photography for a number of years and am very impressed by the results of the 990. Image quality is outstanding. The camera is easy to use. My only complaint is the software included with the 990. It wouldn't recognize the camera on my usb port, no matter what I did. I tried it on 3 different computers, and had the same problem with Windows 95, 98 and ME. I downloaded all the stuff from the web, and finally after many frustrating hours got the images transferred to the computer. Now, it works like a breeze. The red-eye is a problem, as everyone has mentioned before. But, I knew that when I bought the camera, and use it mostly for product, tabletop work. I give it 4 stars only because of the software problems and red-eye...minor problems that can be solved one way or another....END","Date":"February 2, 2001"}

We are able to go down to nearly two centimeters on objects that we used to pay $200-$300 for pics from the net. This camera is simply amazing. In addition, new software that can be downloaded into the camera itself makes the manual settings even better. I have been a 35mm film guy for over 15 years. This camera, the 990, has changed all of that. I think the 990 has put us on the threshold of a new era of photography. Throw on the extra lenses and this camera can do almost anything. I recommend it highly. We are using photos for a small trade magazine and even some trade show graphics. While you are unable to produce the much larger scale graphics, this little camera is simply out of this world.","Date":"January 11, 2001"}

What are you waiting for?  I bought the 990 when it first became available at Amazon.com back in July.  I've been using it for everything.  I take it on mountain bike rides, take it to the beach, use it for fast action sports, portraits, you name it.  I love taking movies with it, too.  They're very easy to load into Premiere to add special effects.  This camera has options and features designed to work in all environments.  Make sure you have V1.1 software, though.  With V1.0, I was DYING while waiting for the camera to store all the pictures I took while in continuous mode.  This is one of my favorite modes, especially with soccer games.  But, with V1.1, as soon as you let go of the shutter release, the camera is ready to take more pictures.  This fix makes the camera as near perfect as can be!  I purchased the 2X telephoto lens...OH MY GOODNESS.  This lens is incredible.  I think the pictures are even SHARPER with this lens on.  It amazes me.  The 3X telephoto lens is now available and I have no doubt that it will exceed my expectations.  I also purchased the remote shutter release which adds more features to the camera like time lapse photography!  Cool for sunsets/sunrises.  Also, if you think the swivel feature of this camera is going to cause problems...DON'T.  It's the neatest thing and one of the biggest reasons I decided on this camera over the Olympus.  Well, why haven't you clicked the \"Purchase Now\" button???  Hurry!","Date":"November 20, 2000"}

This camera is very popular for this use as the quality of the macro photographs is excellent.  All of the positives and most of the negatives have already been stated about this camera.  I want to add an irritating design flaw that to my knowledge cannot be fixed.  After careful, but frequent use for 3 years, the plastic 'nub' that the battery compartment door latches to has first bent and then broken off.  The plastic piece is part of a large casting and cannot be replaced.  This has happened to 4 Nikon 990s used at our school.  I complained about this defect at a recent meeting and found that multiple colleagues at other institutions have experienced the identical defect.Using adhesive tape to wrap the battery compartment shut has offered a temporary solution, but this unit uses batteries too quickly for taping to be more than a temporary stop gap until we buy new cameras..Nikon 990s are still readily available on the web.  This design flaw limits very frequent use.","Date":"June 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Great camera","Author":"M. Warren","ReviewID":"RRU08KTMGKC2A","Overall":"good","Content":"I was hesitatant about buying a digital camera, especially at the price. But after seeing many web sites with images from the camera, I took the plunge. Shooting digitally is a bit different from traditional photography. I tend to use the LCD screen to set up shots, and you can't really fire shots off as quickly with a digital camera, it has to autofocus, etc. But, I, and others who've seen my photos, love the quality. I print them out on a HP Deskject 1220, which when using photo quality paper makes brilliant prints.I took this camera to France. I shot over 1,500 images. I took 4 flash cards with me, since I had no way to upload the images while I was there. The images I got from that trip were worth the price of the camera alone. I now have a bound book of images I printed on my HP. There will always be arguments over film and digital cameras. I own both. I love each for what they can do. The Nikon CP990 delivers great quality, a lot of flexibility in use, which takes some time to learn. You can shoot macro, adjust contrast, adjust the EV value, shoot in black and white and even capture 30 seconds of video.I bought the Nikon wide angle 28 lens. The standard lens just doesn't capture as much as I liked.All in all, this has been a great tool to have. I shoot almost daily with it. If you want a digital camera and intend to use it heavily, then go for it. You won't be disappointed.","Date":"January 9, 2002"}
{"Title":"Follow up: one year on","Author":"Gillian","ReviewID":"R17TQH2P5PF51L","Overall":"good","Content":"I reviewed this camera a year ago, a few weeks after I got it. I still give it 4 stars, though my reasons are a little different.What's good about it: The photos. The quality is amazing. Combined with my Epson photo printer, I get stunning results. Far better than going to a photo lab. The cost. Yes, the camera and accessories are initially expensive to buy, but (as I predicted) I have saved a small fortune in film and developing costs. Ease of use. This camera is as easy to use as you want it to be. There are lots of options, but I find I take most photos using the automatic settings. Also, it's small enough to just throw in a bag without the need for extra lenses, etc. I bought a telephoto lens, but find I rarely use it.The main problem is batteries. The camera devours batteries like you wouldn't believe. Be prepared to either spend a small fortune on them (and get weighed down carrying around lots of them), or to buy several sets of rechargeables. Other things to think about: Last time I complained that adding lenses disabled the flash. While this is still true, I have found it not to be as big a problem as I expected. There are many occasions when I might have used a flash with a 35mm camera but don't need it with this one. It is still a problem in many indoor situations, however. Getting the photos into a computer can also be a problem. I have no problems with my laptop, the enclosed usb cable/software works very well. On a recent trip I had to use my husband's laptop instead and couldn't get the software to run properly, despite it supposedly being compatible with Windows 2000. I bought a cheap card reader and this solved the problem. All in all, I am extremely happy with the camera and still recommend it. I haven't used my 35mm camera in over a year, which goes to show just how much I prefer the Coolpix 990.","Date":"July 26, 2001"}

For those of you who are new to photography, it operates as a point-and-shoot.  If you are looking to advance your skills, it offers manual ability (apeture, shutter speed and focus).  This camera has all the features of a Nikon SLR.  This camera takes sharp and clear pictures, and is definately worth the price!The only downfall to the camera is that is is prone for causing redeye due the close proximity of the lens and the flash.  Nikon just introduced the Nikon Coolpix 995 that is essentialy the same as the 990 but with a pop-up flash.  That should eliminate the red eye.I would expect the 995 to drive down the price of the 990.  If the price between the two camerasis incidental, go for the pop-up flash to elimate the red eye.  If the price difference is alot, stick with the 990 - you won't be disappointed, and editing software makes it super easy to remove redeye.I upload my images to photoworks.com.  Their software allow you to edit the picture before you send it - their red eye reduction is a snap.  The quality of the pictures is tremendous - noone ever knows the image is digital!Good luck with the camera - you are guarenteed to love it!","Date":"June 18, 2001"}

I use the Nikon coolpix 990 nearly every day of my working week.  There are several features that make this product particularly good.  The macro facility allows me to take pictures of small features (e.g. fingertips and even down the operating microscope) in enormous detail.  The large buffer means that there is no delay between pressing the shutter release and acquiring a picture. The colour reproduction is excellent and (importantly) very realistic. Battery consumption is also good when using Ni-metal hydride batteries.  I need a change of batteries every 10-14 days despite daily use (20-40 Mb of photographs at basic resolution) with the flash on for nearly all pictures.  The only drawback is the built-in flash which works under most circumstances but may occasionally pose a problem when taking pictures at short range because of the asymmetric position. Overall, the camera is so good that it has rapidly become the 'standard' issue for nearly all plastic surgery residents in London.","Date":"June 2, 2001"}

It's flexible, automatic or manual operation and the quality is approching top end 35mm boxes (I've used a Canon SLX for about 30 years) for the majority of one's use. The 3.+MP is the key when shooting images for 8x10 displays. It is necessary to upgrade the memory amount to a minimum of 64MB(~ [$]) and use the 1,500mahr batteries w/ a charger, a set of 4 batteries will cost about [$](with charger, about [$]).  I shoot in 35mm mode at high resolution and get about 5-6 hours of battery life & ~ 60 images per 64MB of RAM & use the USB download to my laptop.  If most of your work is indoors, get the optional AC adapter ~ [$] I have 2 other digcams, the image quality of those are ok for small displayed images up to about 4 x 5's, but the 990 is top shelf for the price!

You may be able to get a good deal on a used model.  I use it as camera that is shared by many departments where I work, so it gets heavy use.The quality of photos taken in bright light on the \"fine\" setting is stunning and prints well as 8 x 10s (you can even get away with larger sizes, if you don't mind a little pixelation).  The camera's auotmatic mode is adequate for most shots, but you can adjust the shutter speed and other customizable features.  The pivoting lens body is also handy to get into tight spaces.  The LCD screen is bright, but can be hard to read outdoors.Battery life is 40+ photos with rechargables.  I don't recommend using Alkalines with this camera, but they work in a pinch.The biggest drawback with this camera is the flash.  The proximity of the lens to the flash means you'll be correcting lots of \"red eye\" on your PC or Mac.  The flash is also very weak in low to medium light situations, and you can't add an external flash to the camera.This camera sometimes fails to start when turning it on, or shuts off after a few seconds on, but turning it off and on again seems to help.

{"Title":"Almost mature technology","Author":"Ken Zirkel \"Kickstand\"","ReviewID":"R3K8HQQNFG7T4M","Overall":"good","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 990 represents the point-and-shoot digital technology ALMOST mature. The shutter delay is hardly noticeable, and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly. Batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time. However, the Quicktime movie capability is a little awkward -- no sound -- and the color of the images seems to always be a problem. However, if you're looking to buy a digital point-and-shoot today, this is the camera to buy. The independent, rotational-lens design is brilliant. You can point the thing at yourself and view your self-portrait as you take it, which by itself makes this camera  a standout in my book. Add to that the top-quality optics and dazzling array of features, and this model is the one to beat.Given all that, for the time being I'll stick to my (film-based) Olympus Stylus Epic for most of my shooting on-the-go. The Nikon is too big, too slow, too energy-hungry, and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the Olympus does.","Date":"May 15, 2001"}
{"Title":"Battery compartment replacement ... repair at your own risk!","Author":"R. Clark","ReviewID":"R36JFVCZP4UG7X","Overall":"good","Content":"Suffice it to say, the cp990 battery door and battery compartment issues have been established. For me, it was one of the little plastic catches on the battery compartment that failed (broke).  Once the integrity of the tiny plastic catch has been compromised it's either tape-the-door-shut or replace-the-compartment.  I was quoted $120 and $150 for the repair at two respectable camera shops.  In 2006 this camera can/could be had used at approx $200  or less - I would/did NOT pay to have it repaired.  I guess the 'not repairing it' logic would also point to why the cost is so high -- if a camera shop hoses the job, then they'd most likely have to replace the camera.  Luckily I found the 'battery compartment' piece on the big auction site and ordered it, cost approx $29 plus shipping. In reality, what would I have lost if I messed the camera up further?  For the repair all that was required is a good desk lamp, precision screwdrivers, and patience. I won't turn this rating into a tutorial, I like the camera and it was worth the effort to fix it.  Outside the redeye issues, and the toy like battery compartment, this camera beats most 5mp ps cameras hands down.Repair at your own risk - I did!","Date":"March 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great in *most* situations, poor in others","Author":"Steve Parrott","ReviewID":"R3HS26Y10VNWXO","Overall":"good","Content":"In daylight, you can get excellant quality photos, but in dim light, it is impossible to get sharp shots without a tripod.  Raising the ISO to anything over 100 will result in lots of ugly noise in the photo.  The built in flash is horrible.  It is good to use as a fill flash in outdoor shadows, but will give poor results as a stand alone flash indoors.  For good indoor shots, I have found the best results using a tripod and the \"slow sync\" flash mode. The shutter speed will be very slow, so any movement of the subject will result in blur.  Again, dim light is this camera's biggest fault.  It will ALWAYS set a SLOW shutter speed, making it impossible to hand hold the camera.  Manually setting a faster speed such as 1/30 will not work, because the camera cannot set a large enough f-stop to allow a proper exposure.  So, in the right conditions, the 990 can take perfect photos, but in night or indoor situations, you will have to really make some carefull settings and use a tripod to get good results.  The macro mode is FANTASTIC. It will take stunning close up shots. I really think that is this camera's greatest asset. The rotating head makes taking close ups in ackward positions a breeze.  Another couple negatives though, the monitor is impossible to see in bright sunlight, turn it off to save power and use the viewfinder.  This brings up the second negative, if you have an accessory lens attached to the head, it will block out your view through the viewfinder.  It looks like Nikon has addressed lots of these problems with the new Cool Pix 5700.  I suggest you spend just a little more money and get the 5700, (with lots more zoom and over 5 megapixels), instead of the 990 / 995.","Date":"July 18, 2002"}

I've long relied on the quality of Nikon lenses, in business, and am still, after three years,  surprised that the glass in the E990 is no whit inferior,  notwithstanding that it's meant for e consumer marke.The swivel body is to die for. I can't imagine why Nikon discontinued it. It gives both waist-level and eye-level capability.  You can shoot from ground/floor level without lying down, and, to do macro photography without impossible contortions, this is a very useful, innovative feature.I do a lot of macro photography, also photography of small objects indoors, where I use the AC adapter instead of rechargeable batteries.  Outdoors, the very, very long cord of the battery pack is a nuisance, and the NiMH batteries seem to have lost rather a lot of their charge while just lying idle.  So I have two sets.  These batteries are not made by Nikon, of course. On the other hand, I don't know where to assign blame for the fact that the plugs between camera and battery cord and between cord and batteries tend to lose contact; I have to frequently twist then a bit to restore power, and of course the settings are lost and have to be re-made.  This has been true of three different cords and battery packs.All in all, though, I just *like* the E990.  It feels good, works well, gives excellent results. I rather prefer it to my Nikon D70 (eye-level SLR with professional lenses), although each has its advantages and disadvantages - you need both, if you're serious.","Date":"December 7, 2005"}
{"Title":"The Camera You Can't Outgrow.","Author":"Duncan Kunz","ReviewID":"R3VJ39DRL88FOW","Overall":"good","Content":"The Nikon 990 was my first digital camera, and after eighteen months of use, I don't regret my decision to pick it at all.I chose it because ofits high pixel count (3.34 Mpixels, which make for large images that can print 8X10 and be indistinguishable from a 35mm print);its multi-functionality (point and shoot automatic-everything, aperture preferred, shutter preferred, and even completely manual modes);its popularity (which means that there're TONS of aftermarket lenses, etc. for it); andits ease of use (I'm sold on the rotating body).I've never regretted it.There're warts to the 990, of course; no camera's perfect.  The built-in speedlight right next to the lens guarantees harsh lighting, big shadows, and red-eye (the 995 isn't much better); and the fact that a thousand-dollar camera doesn't come with a hot shoe is scandalous.But the options are there, not only from Nikon but places like EagleEye; and the number of CoolPix 990 user groups on the Internet guarantee a large group of friends you can call on for help.Once you get through the menu learning curve, the ease of use and quality of the image simply can't be beat.  I simply can't imagine a better camera for the money.","Date":"February 18, 2002"}
{"Title":"10 months after purchase still love it...","Author":"Stacey","ReviewID":"RWL5LT283EXCR","Overall":"good","Content":"I love this camera, still!!! When I first bought it the battery life and red eye were the two biggest features I knew I would struggle with. As it turns out, the new Duracell M3 technology batteries are really great and have even replaced my rechargeables, as they last longer.  So really, I think with these new batteries, one problem is solved (for me). ----Note, I bought the Unity Pro 5 battery pack which lasted about six months...also a good idea, but it tends to overcharge and  initially you have to drain some power off the battery----As for the redeye, I have a pretty simple photo editing program for this and it is a hassle , but a workeable one. I could spend the extra 200-300 for an external flash, but so far it hasn't happened.Bottom line---this camera takes amazing pictures, particularly in natural light. You pay a little more for it but, then again it is a NIKON.","Date":"December 24, 2001"}

With Lexar Media flashcards you can hold at least 79 pictures in normal XGA mode. I takes up alot of batteries. Use recharble nikads. Run them up and down a couple of times. One feature I love is the  delete button. I can take some good pictures but out of 100 pictures I  normaly have to throw away at least 5. You also can print as many pictures  as you want. So what, it's around $900.00 in about 3 years you could pay  off that because you don't have to pay for film, devolping and printing.  The LCD display is 100% acurate. Why spend the extra money for a camera  that has \"You see what you get\" when you can have this camera.

{"Title":"Nikon 990","Author":"Dawn Bustanoby","ReviewID":"R2GCEZDSG7TXGT","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall I love this camera and would recommend it, especially considering the price you can get one for now.  However, here are the cons:1)  Red-eye problems.  Nearly every flash photo has red-eye.  I have read that this is because the flash is too close to the lense.  However, fixing red-eye on your computer is easy, so it's a tolerable defect.2)  Although the camera body rotates, it's not quite as user-friendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the Canon G-2.3)  Resolution.  I always shoot on \"fine\", but still end up with some photos that I'm not crazy about the resolution.  Pictures with lots of detail turn out great, but where there is less detail, you end up seeing the little dots.  Although people say a 3.0 megapixel camera approaches film quality, I disagree. I see the pixelation even on 4X6 prints.Conclusion:  I'll continue to use (and love) my Nikon 990 until I save enough to replace with a 4-5 megapixel camera like the Canon G-3 or Nikon 5000.","Date":"December 11, 2002"}

I looked at the Nikon Coolpix 990 listed by amazon.com and this one was listed at $100. I know the camera well and like most of it's features. I can use it as my second camera when I purchase a more modern one. There are two downsides. It eats four AA batteries rather quickly. Not a real problem as I use rechargeable batteries. The second down side is serious. The compact flash memory cards for this camera are essentially unavailable, and they do not last indefinitely.","Date":"June 17, 2011"}

{"Title":"The 990 is jaw-dropping","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R112MBD2CF2VYF","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, I've owned the Olympus D-220 digital camera since it came out 3 years ago and had a great time with this 1/3 megapixel camera at home and at work combined with an Epson Stylus Color 600. I've taken about a thousand shots in this time, remarkable since my film camera still has undeveloped rolls from 4 years ago (just too lazy to get it developed). My 3x5 printouts came out surprisingly good, both for baby pix as well as for my office brochure. After extensive research online (including reading all these Amazon reviews) I decided to step up to a multi-megapixel camera, and the 990 has not disappointed. Certainly this is not a point and shoot like my old digital camera. However, it has a nice automatic as well as manual setting; it behaves like a point and shoot if you want it to (and takes amazing shots on this setting). After spending a few days reading the comprehensive manual, I am amazed at the finesse you can now apply to photographs if you have the time and inclination; 8 second exposures, grey scale photos, rapid-fire mode (I get up to 10 shots at 1.5 exposures a second), a macro feature allowing shots as close as 1 inch...it goes on. The size of my photos has jumped from a 72k jpeg to 700+k jpeg for an average shot, and now my hard drive needs upgrading, but thats a different story. I haven't been able to tell the difference between FINE and NORMAL setting at 2048x1056, and hence my 128M Lexar compact flash that I bought gets me about 160 photos per outing. I am still printing with an Epson 600, and plan to upgrade when Epson gets it right with its 870 and 1270 series printers and the color fade issue. With a few very minor tweaks with Photoshop on my Mac, these are eye popping photos. Couldn't be happier.","Date":"September 26, 2000"}

I only got it for the Camera though!!! er.... and to see what I looked like in a bridal veil! He he!! ;-)So it doesn't have a screen on the back, a flash, a lens cover or more than 2 buttons! What it does do is take pictures that are good enough for the web or just keeping for memories. You won't want to print them out, as the resolution is not really good enough.I read these comments before I bought it, and came to the conclusion that the people who were ranting and raving about how 'bad' this camera was, were the type of people who don't belive in 'You get what you pay for'! I do, I didn't want to pay loads and therefore I'm happy! Especially as I only spent [price], which is about half a night out for me!The software is easy to use, and takes seconds to download or to delete. I get 30 pic's out of it easy. You need lots of light, so if you want to take pic's in a nightclub or in a bedroom when you get home (wink wink), get one that has a flash!!!!Well there we go, I'm no professional photographer, which is probably why I'm happy with this camera!

The image quality and focus  were very OK! Can the resolution be better? Obviously. Would it be nice to  have on-camera previews? Obviously. Would it be nice if the camera was  faster? Obviously.

While the camera performs adequately well in  taking quality outdoor photos, it falls far behind in flash photography.  While advertised as having a red-eye reduction capability, I have found  red-eye to be an ongoing problem and existing in every photo where people  or animals are photographed. I am extremely disappointed in the performance  of this camera in the price range where it is sold.  I would expect this  level of quality to be acceptable only in a camera costing much less.  I  have owned this camera for two years and have discontinued using it because  of the frustration I feel when my prints are returned and do not meet my  level of expectation. I should have done more research before buying this  product where most of my selection was based on the Canon name.","Date":"June 6, 2000"}

I don't tend to pick the same thing again when I can have something new and different, but there just isn't another compact zoom camera that takes pictures anywhere near the quality of those I get with my Z135 (you'll see what I mean when you buy one and compare).  The portraits are particularly stunning and the camera is much faster than others (the competitors use only one battery and take too long to focus and snap).  I used to lug around an SLR with various lenses, but this camera replaced all of it.  As a result, I tend to have it with me when the great shots are out there. The zoom range is impressive and the handy dial on the back makes it simple to turn on and shoot with.  This is a wonderful camera!","Date":"December 2, 2001"}

It only jammed up on me one time with a 36 exposure roll of film, I never went over a 24 exposure roll after that.  Unfortunately the camera door closure uses a little piece of plastic - and that one cheap piece ended the life of this camera - unless I can get a new door.  So I would say not as durable as some others indicated.  Since the door also encases some electronics this isn't likely to be a quick swap of doors.The amazing part about this camera is one little battery would last me what seemed like a year sometimes (I am sure it was close), even when taking 50 photos a week!  Many of those photos were with using the flash.Most of my photos look professional quality - friends always ask what camera I used to take such good photos.  I also take photos of our dogs - and the zoom works wonders as you can get back away and take a nicely lighted portrait.  Or catch them in action from across the yard.  Has been great on trips also (has been to 4 continents with me and small enough not to be a burden carrying around.Yes I would definitely purchase another - or maybe consider the Z155 which for some reason is slightly less expensive at this time.  I just wish they had put the extra effort in the camera door closure .. likely mine would be the last camera I needed for a long time.","Date":"July 17, 2002"}

Bilby \"littlebibs\"","ReviewID":"R1IR2QNJRUQISR","Overall":"good","Content":"I came home from a month's vacation in Japan back in 1999 with this nice little camera I picked up in Tokyo. After taking some of the most stunning photos on my way up Mt. Fuji and around the southern Japancountry side I thought this was just the best at the time. I got homeand started using it more indoors where it didn't perform the way I'dhoped, but some of the photos were just so perfect, the ones not so goodI chalked it up to whatever I was drinking?  But....the major flaw thatoccured with this camera was suddenly the two duracell ultra 123 lithum batteries for this camera @ $16.00-18.00 were getting eating within a 24 hours after I put them in the camera. It was a mistake to have purchasedthis in Japan as I was told there was something seriouly wrong and itwould COST to have it fixed. I was also told that the camera's flaw wasthe design of having the pop up flash on/off where it could accidentlycome on while in the camera bag.  I decided I didn't want to sent this outand put out more $$ for this.  I found taking the batteries out was thesmartest thing to do but if you forgot, the next day their dead,  didn't much care for dealing with this anymore... and now with all the newdigitals out, this will be a backup if I can find the batteries in thenear future??

{"Title":"Good things come in small packages","Author":"\"wcharlief\"","ReviewID":"R5L92IN3ROJAN","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading some of the other Amazon reviews, I felt compelled to write my own.First off, I'll get the only bad thing about this camera out of the way.  You MUST buy the optional power supply kit, otherwise you will be spending an extra 20 bucks for a Lithium CR5 battery every couple of weeks.  The power supply kit, from what I have seen, goes for about 60-80 bucks, and includes the rechargable battery, charger, and A/C adapter (for operating without a battery when plugged into the wall, which comes in very handy).Without buying this kit, the camera does come with the required lithium battery, serial cable for PC, serial cable for Mac, USB for PC/Mac, video cable, and an 8MB compact flash memory card.  (Wrist strap, CD-rom, manuals and camera also included, obviously)  First of all, the 8MB memory card can hold a lot more than 12 pictures, as quoted by one of the reviewers.  If you read the manual, you'll find that the S10 can take pictures in 3 different resolutions, as well as 3 different compression ratios.  In other words, 1600x1200 is a huge picture, and most normal people find 800x600 (the smallest setting) to be plenty sufficient for taking everyday pictures.  Most people's computer resolutions are set to 800x600, and a picture that size would fill up the whole screen, if that gives you any idea.  If you set the camera to 800x600 and high compression, you can put 61 pictures on the 8MB card.  These are only a couple of the good customization options I found by reading the manual.  This camera also 4x digital zoom and 2x regular zoom, which was not clarified by another reviewer.  This feature can be enabled if you turn it on in the camera settings.  It's not enabled by default.Besides the zoom and large amount of picture storage, this camera can do a ton of stuff that I couldn't do on my old Fujifilm camera.  Aside from the resolution and compression options, and the 4x digital zoom, the S10 can be set to manual mode and adjusted for specific situations.  You can adjust the white balance, exposure level, object focus, and lighting condition options.  If you don't feel like fooling with all these individually, there's an \"Image\" mode which allows you to set the camera for specific conditions, like Landscape, Fast shutter, Slow shutter, Night scene, and Black and white.  And even further than this, there's a regular picture-taking mode for amateurs that allows you to just point and click while the camera automatically adjusts to the best settings.  To top it all off, there's an included slide show option that cycles through all the pictures or a specific line-up that you make, which when hooked up to the TV (via the video cable) can make for great, quick entertainment, without having to download all the pictures and show them to someone on a computer.  And for the outdoor photographer, there's an included photo-stitching mode that allows you to take several pictures, vertically or horizontally, and stitch them together seamlessly with the included software.  (I.e. taking 3 pictures of a long beach and pasting them together)In summary, after reading the manual included with the S10, I found that nearly everything is included into this durable, pocket-size camera.  I'm extremely glad that I bought it, and it far outperforms my Fujifilm camera in picture quality, useablity, and transfer speeds. (with the USB cable).  Even the LCD display is much brighter and clearer!  Plus it looks cool!  It's hard to go wrong if buying this camera.  You won't be let down.","Date":"October 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Convenient and high quality","Author":"Russell Belfer","ReviewID":"R5MT7SAMT0QP6","Overall":"good","Content":"The S10 is a fine little camera.  In automatic mode, it quickly snaps 1600x1200 shots with medium level compression.  You can fit about a dozen on the 8MB CompactFlash card that comes with the camera; I get around 55+  on my 32MB card.  These shots are fairly high quality; in good lighting  conditions, I can print them as 4x6 photos and they look at least as good  as my cheapy 35mm camera.You can put the camera in manual mode for  greater control over compression, image size, gain, digital zoom, etc.  This can be useful, but this camera is not targeted towards the person who  wants elaborate details control.  It does contain some easy-to-use  sophisticated features: the panorama stitch mode is extremely easy, and the  black-and-white and other \"special effects\" shot types are also  just a twist of the dial away.What are the weak points?  Well, for one,  it's pretty appalling that the camera doesn't ship with the Canon  rechargable battery.  You will need to purchase that and a recharger right  away (at an additional cost of around $100).  Also, although it isn't  horrible, I would prefer a 3x optical zoom.  2x just doesn't do that much.  Number three, the optical viewfinder doesn't align very tightly with the  actual shot -- you can use the LCD display, but that drains the batteries.  Finally, I was disappointed that there is so little tactile feedback when  you snap a picture.  I'm wary about having a stranger take my photo with  this camera because I fear they won't realize when they've taken the  shot!I've found that having a digital camera fundamentally changes they  way I take photographs.  I'm much more likely to snap 3 or 4 shots of a  particular view and then immediately scan over them and pick the best 1 (or  2) and discard the others.  This was a lot of fun and I think it improved  the overall quality of photos that I take.  (Of course, I could just try to  become a better photographer...)  The Canon S10 is easy to use and carry  around, and I'm happy that I purchased it.","Date":"May 15, 2000"}
{"Title":"Amazing value...","Author":"Andre Stechert","ReviewID":"RLN2FYPP2A8ZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought one of these S10's.  As a 2 megapixel camera (where thegeneral classes are 1, 2, and 3 megapixels..., respectively at the time of this writing), I've been very happy with my purchase.  My main reasons for choosing this camera were:1. It has a USB connection. Very important for speedy downloads.  Do NOT get a 2mp or greater camera without one.  Warning: Win98/Win2000 are your best bets - NT doesn't support USB and neither does win95.2. It supports CompactFlash Type II.  I like CF better than SmartMedia.  It's cheaper, supports higher capacity cards, and is more durable.3. It supports the IBM MicroDrive 340 CF type II card (which would be a reason to buy this camera over the new digital ELPH S100, which is too small for that drive).  340MB = about 500 pictures for about $300. How huge is that!4. My lower bound was 2 megapixels.  The 3 Meg cameras JUST came out, so the prices on these two megapixel cameras all dropped by about 50% a few months ago.  3 megapixel cameras are still pretty pricey...5. The review on dpreview was very good. Phil Askey explains in great depth the pluses and minuses of these cameras.  I value his opinion a lot and he highly recommended this camera.6. Battery life is reputed to be about 50 shots with regular use of the LCD preview and scanning shots.  That seems about right in my usage so far.7. Extremely compact and rugged, fits in your pants pocket.  Has a sturdy non-plastic tripod mount.Biggest surprises after buying the camera:1. The software that came with the camera is surprisingly good.  Thumbs up.2. The batteries that you use are about $12 a pop, unless you get the rechargeables.  The recharging device is a little under $100 and comes with one battery.  Everyone recommends this as the first accessory followed by purchase of two more rechargeables (for a total of three) at about $35/ea.  With this setup, you can take about 150 pictures - teamed with a 340Mb MicroDrive you can fit the entire vacation on the camera with room to spare!3. I'd like to find a nice protective case for it, but they don't seem to be available :(.4. You can't do the flash upgrade of the camera's firmware without the recharger kit.  Fair warning!5. The 340MB drive had some minor incompatibilities with the camera until the software patch released the first week of May 2000.6. The LCD panel has the best anti-glare of any digital camera I've ever used.  Big FAT SORT.Hope this helps!","Date":"May 31, 2000"}
{"Title":"Good form factor, sharp pictures, mediocre color capture","Author":"hyperbolium","ReviewID":"R389VK8JJLFIZZ","Overall":"good","Content":"The S10 packs a lot of features into a compact form. As a tote-around point-and-shoot, it's a good choice. The retracting lens and automatic cover make it easy to pack, and the ability to take high capacity memory  cards or IBM disk devices allow you to take quite a few pictures (even at  2-megapixel resolution) without downloading.On the downside, the S10  consumes battery power at a higher rate than other digital cameras I've  used, and the specialized batteries are expensive. The rechargeable battery  pack from Canon is helpful, but it's not included with the camera, upping  the cost of a useable configuration.The 2x optical zoom is a bit short,  given that many of the competitors products give you 3x. I often find that  missing magnification requires me to shoot at a higher resultion and crop  the result.Most disappointing is the S10's inabilities to accurately  capture colors in the red-orange range. Flesh tones are often rendered  incorrectly, and flash pictures often end up leaving skin looking pasty. No  amount of adjusting the cameras controls seems to solve the problem.  I've  read reports by others who've suffer the same results, so I'm inclined to  think it's a software problem, rather than an issue with my individual  unit.In addition to the rechargeable battery pack, I'd recommend using  this with a computer that has a USB port (and getting a USB card if your  machine doesn't have one!), as downloading pix, expecially high-resolution  shots, through the serial port is painfully slow.","Date":"July 13, 2000"}

S10 is also very compact compared with many other digital cameras, which is an excent choice if you have limited space on vacations. The feature I like most about this digi cam is that it has its own slide show built-in which you can hook up to your television with another cable that is provided in the package. Plus some other feature including Black and White photographs, slow motion, red eye reduction, etc.Here are some of my regrets: 1. The software that is provided with the digi cam is very poorly put together and crashes alot on my Toshiba notebook.2. The CompactFlash that is provided is TOO limited I would buy the 340MB card or buy a couple more of those 8MB cards.3.  S10 uses to much power, you will need to buy the recharger for around $100 because the Canon is so desperite to get more money, or you need to buy a dozen of those batteries at $12 each3. 2x zoom is just not enough, you need at least 5x or greater...","Date":"June 8, 2000"}

I can easily  fit this camera in my pocket on my way to the great outdoors.While I  am outdoors this camera is very sturdy.  When powered down the lens  retracts and is enclosed away from any harm.Now this is how I use my  camera, usually I take my pictures at the highest quality and when my 48mb  cf card fills up I go through my pictures on the viewfinder and delete the  ones that I don't like so much, and I fire away with my memory free'd up.Back at my computer I upload with the USB connection (must have,  anything else is WAY to slow).

{"Title":"Pleased with Canon S10","Author":"Tom Bailey","ReviewID":"R3D4Y8U0JB6G1D","Overall":"good","Content":"At almost the last minute before leaving on an Alaskan cruise, I decided to dump my usual point-and-shoot camera and go digital.  Amazon got the camera to me the day before I left - needless to say, I was reading the  manual and taking test photos on the plane to Anchorage!  I found the S10  to be very easy to use, and very difficult to take bad pictures with.  I'm  still discovering new features.  One of my favorites is the ability to  connect the camera to any television set and show your pictures within  seconds of taking them.  We did this several times on the ship.  The  compact size of the S10 makes it more likely that I will carry it with me  on outings, rather than leave it at home.  I've not yet gotten into the  computer/software side of digital photography, but I'll attack that soon -  I just got back from Alaska yesterday.  Three recommendations:  1) you MUST  get the rechargeable battery set, and probably an extra rechargeable  battery.  It's unfortunate that the charger outfit was not included with  the camera (and included in the price).  For this reason, if I had it to do  over again, I would look very closely at the Canon S100.  2)  You should  consider getting a larger capacity compact flashcard - I got a 32Meg, which  holds about 140 snapshot-type pictures. 3)Think about getting a soft case  for the camera - Canon makes a leather case - you can also get nylon cases  that work.  I worry about scratching or otherwise damaging the LCD screen  while carrying the camera unprotected.","Date":"June 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"This was a great purchase","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3MP9UC1HGY6XS","Overall":"good","Content":"I really have enjoyed the performance and ease of use of this camera.  Its small size makes it very easy to have available when it's needed.  Sure the S100 is smaller, but it sacrfices a few features such as an auxilliary status screen (saves batteries).  Canon really should include the power supply/recharger as the camera is not practicle without it.  There is one feature that I should point out (haven't noticed it in other reviews here): The S10 is compatible with the IBM Microdrive (as certified by both Canon and IBM).  This Microdrive replaces the meager 8MB flash memory card that comes with the camera.  It is 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of the equivalent number of flash memory cards.  Just plug in the 340MB or 1GB version and watch the picture capacity counter go through the roof.  With a 340MB Microdrive, I can take over 280 pictures of the highest resolution and least compression.  I could get over 3000 pictures at lower resolutions and quality, but why settle for sub-optimal images?

{"Title":"Canon S10 digital camera: an excellent value","Author":"Sean","ReviewID":"R2USVCL52L5VRG","Overall":"good","Content":"The Canon S10 camera is an excellent value at the current price (...). The class of camera has some limitations (only 2x optical zoom), but compared to other cameras in the same price catagory, I rate it at the top. You may also want to consider the Nikon CoolPix 800 which is neck and neck  (although no USB).Some good aspects:1. The image quality is  excellent. See ... a review which rates this as equal to  or better than Nikon digital cameras (even the more expensive ones). Also,  see the image quality for yourself at the online gallery.2. The camera  is very compact and the lens automatically retracts and covers itself (!)  when not in use.3. Autofocus is very good and the camera has a red light  which allows it to focus in the dark. Trying to focus with digital cameras  using a range finder or LCD is difficult if you haven't tried it, so this  is important. I didn't realize this as I am  used to 35mm SLR cameras.  There is also a focus lock which allows some override.4. Red eye  reduction feature, a macro mode and rapid shooting feature.5. Camera  case is metal! Doesn't seem to scratch easily as metal has a mat finish  with some kind of 'kryptonite' coating. This kind of attention to quality  is something that supposedly isn't around any more in consumer products.  Congratulations Canon on refusing to compromise on this (I'm not a 'things  ain't what they used to be' person).Not so good:1. Canon rechargable  kit neccesary - a must buy so figure into the total cost. This kit  apparently comes with the camera outside the U.S.2. Connector for  downloading to the computer has a release button to remove the connector  which hurts my thumb/is difficult to remove. This is not an issue if you  take the CompactFlash memory out and use a cardreader to download your  photos (My particular connector may just be defective).Overall, very  happy with this purchase. Realize that the total price for your setup with  the power kit and extra rechargable battery can be additional ~$... (That  is not to mention the additional cost for all these cameras: more/greater  memory cards)","Date":"June 23, 2000"}

I am a REALTOR with a Century 21 franchise and use my camera for business and for fun.  It takes wonderful pictures at all resolutions.  It's single greatest asset though is its size.  It will fit in my jacket pocket and can be powered up and used any time.  I paid almost nine hundred dollars for the camera, power pack/battery and case when the camera first came on the market.  At it's current price point it is a bargain.  The s20 may even be worth the extra for the higher resolution depending on your needs. Also the software is easy to use and the photo stitch program for panarama shots works very well.  I wish there was an affordable second battery available.  Sometimes when your traveling it is not always easy to recharge the battery.  Do not buy the camera without buying the rechargeable battery kit.","Date":"December 12, 2000"}
{"Title":"Some tips when using this camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2MPGG6R50NKEN","Overall":"good","Content":"1. Turn the LCD screen off except when framing shots.  This will allow the  battery to last a long time.  2. Make sure that you have the most recent  operating system for the camera.  It should be v.1.0.0.2.  You can verify  this (via any of the included software programs) when the camera is  connected to your computer.  This firmeware upgrade corrects many of the  color imbalances as well as allowing a faster shutter speed for flash  pictures (1/30th sec. vs. 1/15th), which reduces the probability of camera  shake. 3. Don't try and install the firmware upgrade (available on the  Canon website) if you have a Mac.  I don't know the genesis of the problem  (something about the USB connection or an installation glitch) but for most  people the camera freezes during upgrade, rendering it useless.  Canon can  install this for you under warranty and are very quick on turnaround.  (I  guess this is a long winded way of saying - give it a shot, but only if  you're prepared to send it to Canon anyway).I'd give it 5 stars, but the  glitch I had with the firmware upgrade irked me.  Canon did fix it promptly  and the camera works like a charm.","Date":"September 5, 2000"}

I agree that it's kind of annoying that you have to pay extra for an AC adapter, but I think Canon learned from their mistakes.  I am now looking for an S110 for even more compact size.Pros:- Solid metal body.I dropped it on concrete floor (unintentionally),and I really thought the camera is not going to work any more. I was wrong.  Except for the dent at the corner, the LCD just came back up and I continued to take pictures.- Good Camera Lens quality.Maybe this is not a Carl Zeiss Lens but it's a decent glass multi element lense from Canon. Fairly decent picture quality for a 2.1 megapixel machine.- retractable lens.This keep the form factor compact.- Fast usb transfer of images.I used the serial connection for images transfer from camera to pc for over a year until I purchase a computer with USB connection (yes I had an old old machine).  The performance difference was dramatic when I moved to USB.- Slide show, video out to TVThe basic on function is pretty intuitive. Video out is convenient cause I can show others the picture on TV right after I took the picture. (not everyone have a computer)Cons- The software that comes with Cannon, although it works, it's not the best.- Short battery life.I have to turn off the LCD most of the time to conserve electricity.the overall experience with this Canon product is good. That's why I bought a Canon ZR25MC for video and may replace my S10 with S110.","Date":"December 15, 2001"}

With it's multi settings, I have found it great for taking pictures while riding as a passenger in a car at speed of 50 MPH set on Burst Rec Mode up to 16 pictures in sequence all in focus 1 Picture every 0.5 sec. This setting is also good when you want to eliminate the flash. Zoom Mode is great as a quick copying for old pictures and much faster than a scanner and who carries a scanner with them? With all settings except for Burst Rec Mode you can record (SOUND CLIPS). Remember it uses up disk space. When visiting family and friends, this camera has a copy feature. So take extra disks. Take your pictures on the floppy, use copy mode and then you can save it on the super disk. Don't delete a part of a set of pictures as it will create a disk error if you do. Do your deleting after you down load to your computer.The soft ware that comes with the camera  can enhance the quality of your pictures when there is poor lighting or you want to crop to enhance the picture.Finally, the built in lens cover  feature alone would be my choice over the Sony without this feature.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

However, I have bee using the Mavica that belongs to a friend for some time.  After seeing its debut, the Palmcam as Panasonic calls it...I knew I wanted one.  Once you connect it via its USB port, Windows sees it as another disk drive.  From there its easy to copy to the hard disk for speedy printing or processing with the included photodeluxe from Adobe - or you can leave the photos on the superdisk to do with as you please - 1500 photos at normal resolution, 800 at medium and 400 at high resolution is a lot of space - you don't have to carry ten floppies with you anymore!  Batteries?  One recargeable battery pack is all you need, it recharges in less than two hours - unless you plan to take photos nonstop for more than an hour - then get a spare if you can't use the direct DC adapter which gives you unlimited power.  It may be slow in terms of waiting for the photos to write to the disk, but that's what the burst mode is there for if you need it.

If you like itsy-bitsy cameras, this one is not for you.  If you like a decent-sized camera (that can't get lost in your wallet!!!) this is for you.Not great for sports or high speed shots.  Great with posed pictures, pictures around the house, we use it at the botanical gardens a lot.  It usually comes with Super Disks- these are expensive and rather hard to find.  Then you have to use a converter to get them onto your computer (they don't work in a floppy drive).  Use a floppy instead, it's much easier to click and then put the floppy in the floppy drive, attach, and send.Even though the resolution is only 1.3, it has been useful when our big, fancy 35mm camera failed at the Grand Canyon.  You know instantly if the picture turned out or if grandma blinked.  The colors did not turn out as strong as a higher resolution camera...but then again, we didn't have to spend 10 minutes setting up for the shot.  The slide-button zoom is extremely easy to use.  We got several beautiful pictures of the largest crows we had ever seen -the size of cats- right down to the gleam on their feathers.I take a lot of pictures of our garden, the house, the dogs, the cats, my husband being goofy on the lawn mower, and I am always able to go right in and attach it to an email and send them to my mom within minutes.  A cheap old floppy is waaaay more accessable for us than the SuperDisks, and in normal mode, holds about 10 pictures.  I always walk around with a few floppies- at a buck each, I can afford to!  Super Fine mode holds about 5 pictures on a regular floppy.It is easy to hold and easy to use.  For what we spent on a used one, <$200.00, we couldn't be happier. We bought ours from someone who wanted at least 3 megapixels and decided to get rid of it.  We will definitely be trying the PV-SD5000 (3.3 megapixel model) as soon as the prices come down and we can get one that has been gently used, probably from someone who \"needed\" 6 megapixels (why?!?!?!) and wants to get rid of their camera.

I have to photograph houses and this camera is a real worker - it has never let me down. The battery charges quickly, too. After a recent OS crash I installed XP and was bummed out to find that the included software does not support XP. But my disappointment was short-lived when I remembered the copy function. I just copied my pics from the Super Disk to a regular floppy, inserted in my PC and the XP viewer took it from there. It may even have been faster than downloading!

It has served me well. I have take over 5,000 pics atleast with this camera... recently I upgraded my MAC OS to 10.3 well my super dish external drive no longer worked... but I pulled out my USB cable and turn it to PC and was able to still use my camera to down load my images. I spent a couple of hours today looking at replacement digital cameras (before I relize about the USB cable). I was really disappointed really with what is out there. Most used AA batteries which will only last a couple of hours and you throw away. The only thing close to this camera is a CDR/CDRW camera by SONY sd350 and higher... problem is the same with this camera... it uses special 3\" disks... which might be outdated in a couple of years... if that. All the cameras out there use those cheap little memory chips... I can just see me losing a $100 chip now or breaking the stupid thing. Yeah this camera is BIG but it is rugged for a digital... I plan on using this camera for as long as it last.I wish Panasonic made a newer version of this camera.","Date":"March 25, 2004"}

It is the smallest 3.3mp camera on the market and takes incredible pictures. The best part about this camera is its ability to take both type 1 and type 2 cf cards. This means that the S20 can use  the IBM Microdrive (170 or 340 mb). With the 340 mb drive (@$400, with  pcmcia card adapter), the camera can hold 379 shots at largest size with  medium resolution, or 164 shots at largest size with best resolution. I  literally shoot all day and sort the pictures out later. No more asking  yourself, \"should I take this shot, or will I fill the card too  quickly.\" If you are not going to buy the microdrive, I really don't  see the need to pay $800 for this camera. Its like buying a rolls royce and  getting bicycle tires. Also, be aware that the S20 takes a proprietary  battery (cannot be replaced by regular batteries in a pinch). When you buy  the camera, buy at least one extra battery that day. Nothing is worse than  having 150 shots left, but a dead battery. I love my S20, but be aware that  after the camera, charger, 340mb microdrive and an extra battery, you are  talking about $1350.","Date":"July 12, 2000"}

Until the 3million megapixel camera's came out.  This isn't the right camera for professional shooting, as it does not  take raw tiff's.. but the large superfine Jpeg's turn out close enough to  raw images. This is a high end Point and Shoot camera, you do not need  professional photography experience to take great photos. The camera is  small and lightweight.. similar to the Canon ELPH camera's design.. so it  can slide in your pocket.. And Canon has been known for their optics for  years.  The software works fine, I just use Adobe Photoshop to get my  images though.  The photostiching is neat, and works well, I took pictures  in a circle around my apartment and stitched them seamlessly together to  make a really wide panoramic shot.. using USB to get your images is FAST, I  had no problems setting the camera up with USB or Serial.  The cons of this  camera is that it doesn't come with rechargable batteries (a MUST have) get  the recharge/ac adaptor kit, or else you will spend hundreds on batteries.  the 16MB CF card will fit about 100 average quality photo's, 34 above  average, but only 7 SuperFine quality photo's (time to go buy a bigger CF  card).. Digital camera's are going to be expensive, especially if you want  quality and features, The higher end Kodak's, Sony's and Olympus's offer  about the same features and quality, but the Kodak and Sony are much larger  and bulkier.

I would agree with the other reviewers on this page with one exception: according to one reviewer you can't check the quality of your photo immediately after  shooting - this is not true: keep the shutter button pressed in after  shooting and the photo appears on the TFT screen until you release the  button. The supplied 16Mb flash card is not enough for efficient use, but  it does get you started. You can take 44 photos in medium res (1024 x 768)  which is good enough quality for screen viewing. Batteries will last long  enough to fill the 16 Mb card but I bought 2 extra rechargables with mine  and I keep TFT screen and flash use to a minimum when not near a power  supply. My biggest niggle with the Canon is that in Auto mode it only takes  pictures in the highest resolution, something like 8 or 9 photo's on the 16  Mb card. With maybe a 170 or 340 Mb IBM micro drive and a couple of extra  rechargable batteries this is a brilliant little machine suitable for most  users, takes great pictures and fits in your jacket pocket too!","Date":"June 18, 2000"}

It is easy to turn out some really nice photos.  I haven't owned another digital camera, so it is difficult to judge battery life, however, many of the digitals do not have a way to turn off the LCD.  Doing so greatly enhances battery life.  Also, instead of the IBM 340Mb micro drive, try the SANS 256MB flash card.  It has much lower battery consumption and still holds 100-300 (in hi-res mode) photos depending upon compression settings.Also, GET the battery charger kit!  It has a NiCad included.  I saved the original lithium as an emergency battery, plus I bought an additional NiCad.  It adds slightly to the price, but you get a really light weight camera that is difficult to top at any price.","Date":"December 4, 2000"}

So-so battery life.In addition, I found that the camera was fairly easy to use. I was able to do the basic things -- take photos, change the resolution, erase, etc. -- on a first or second try. (Then I read the manual to figure out the advanced stuff.)My only dislike of this camera is that its automatic whiteness settings aren't true to life: it's too blue. For example, light-skinned (caucasian and some asians) people's skin has a bluish tint to it. You can play around with the manual settings to get accurately colored photos, but it's a pain to adjust the whiteness for every single snapshot you want to take. The resulting discolorations can generally be fixed in Photoshop, of course, but having to do this for every photo is not ideal.I had heard about the whiteness issues before I bought the camera and purchased it anyway. I'm glad I did; the resolution, its size, and overall quality are worth the slightly disappointing optical issues.","Date":"December 12, 2000"}

It performs outstandingly, and its small size is excellent for carrying in a pocket or purse.  The images, at full 8X10 size when printed on photo paper by a decent printer (HP 932C in my case, about $200), were SO GOOD that people came from all over work to view them in my cubicle.  The zoom is outstanding, the macro is easily as good, the ease of use makes it perfect for the novice, while the flexibility and carriability make it excellent for the most professional (or addicted) photographer around.The ONLY problem I have is that the camara is EXTREMELY sensitive to moisture.  The instruction manual does not make that clear enough, and my camara was ruined after three months by a humid environment.  I can only say excellent camara, EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS BY CANON.  Fortunately for me, Amazon went to bat for me on this purchase, and I highly recommend ANY Amazon purchase.In summation, GREAT camara (even at the $600 I paid, and the $400 price now), crappy customer service by Canon, and truely proffesional sales and support practices by Amazon.JUST DON'T EVER LET THE CAMARA EXPERIENCE EVEN SLIGHT LEVELS OF HUMIDITY!!!!!!!!","Date":"November 1, 2001"}
{"Title":"The Best Little Digital Camera Out There","Author":"Cliff Bauer \"Cliff\"","ReviewID":"R3LP5U8OO1RNQR","Overall":"good","Content":"The Canon S20 is the perfect combination of simplicity, function, and high technology. The camera takes fantastic pictures that are consistently clear, ungrainy, and in focus, even in odd lighting conditions. The metering system is great, as is the autofocus and the telephoto; all work near-flawlessly.The S20's greatest strengths is its simplicity and its size. Although it does not offer advanced features (such shutter-speed priority, full manual, etc.) that some of the Nikons and more expensive Canons do, even an inexperienced camera user (digital or not) will have no problem taking great photographs. All of the moderately complicated features on the Canon such as macro-mode, toggling the flash, and red-eye reduction are as easy as hitting a clearly labelled, obvious button. Additionally, the S20 is just like a \"regular old camera.\" There are no bizare swivling things like on the Nikons, and more importantly, the camera is small enough to fit easily in a small bag or large pocket.Please note that in addition to the camera itself, you will have to buy the battery recharger and, unless you want to be limited to a few megs, an extra PC card which will both add some money to your purchase. Still, for the camera you get, the extra purchases are not a big deal.Overall, a fantastic little camera. Look no further.","Date":"January 10, 2001"}

I took it with me to Vancouver,BC  this summer and shot over 600 pictures in two weeks all on the superfine,large resolution and the quality surpases 35 mm film by fAR. You can fit over 1000 images on the lowest quality but on the highest you can fit around 90-100. Don't even think about using a digital camera any less than 128mb because you'll run out of room quickly. Although this is the first digital camera I have used, I am an experienced photographer and this camera simply makes taking pictures more relaxing and whats better is that you dont need to freak out if 90% of the photos you shot were useless. I used this camera at altitudes of 9000+feet and under very cold conditions and in total darkness as well as on the back of a motorcycle at 90 miles hour. I had used the camera many times prior but I was concerned with getting the most out of my pictures while on vacation so I utilized almost every mode and option on this camera.Pros: -excellent quality during high speed photography even with low light -small, light, durable. I gave up carrying around a [price] nikon slr and a video camera for this baby. -stitch assist mode actually works great; basically it makes panoramas out of a series of pictures you shot. I used it for overlooking Stanley park, grousse mountain, and the totem poles in capilano as a test and I was amazed that it actually worked. Very easy too.Cons: -Battery power is a major issue especially if you have a microdrive which i recommend for this camera if it is cheaper than a 5oomb flashcard; with the lcd screen off you can shoot maybe 90 pics and the highest resolution with the flash. My sister did it at a party 91shots in under 5 minutes and drained a fully charged battery.  -not really manual controls, you cant set aperature and shutter speed but use fast shutter, slow shutter, etc.-flash is good indoors even in complete darkness but outdoors the range is severly limited to about 15 feet at mostI'm assuming if you are reading this you are doing a fair bit of research before buying so you've already encountered the same complaints about battery power and memory but really this camera has the same issues as most digital cameras so there arent any major problems specific to the s-20. Definately buy a microdrive or 500mb+ flashcard if possible but be sure of compatibility before spending some big bucks.","Date":"August 4, 2001"}

After using it for a few days, I realized that it is truly a beginner's camera.  There is little manual options and those that are there, are very \"dumbed down.\"  The resulting pictures from the 3.3 Megapixel CCD are extraordinary.  They are very sharp and crisp.  However, if you are taking pictures of objects further than about 5 ft. away, make sure there is ample lighting because the flash is sub-par.  The Microdrive and the power supply kit certainly add to the overall price of the product, but IMHO, are true necessities.  In conclusion, if you are a beginner and are looking for a simple, easy to use camera that takes great pictures, this is camera for you.

{"Title":"Fantastic Camera, Very Little Complaints","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2LVG6CE89O781","Overall":"good","Content":"This was my second camera, and I bought it almost a year ago.  I did a lot of research, wanting to make sure I bought the right one.  My first camera was a very expensive mistake.  It took proprietary clik! disks and took forever to write to the disk.  The pictures weren't superb either.So when I went out to buy a new camera, I really did my homework.  I was a little taken aback by the fact that I had to purchase the rechargeable battery and charger seperately.  In the end it was the best camera there was, so I sucked it up and bought it seperately.  I now use the original battery sent with the camera as a backup in case the rechargeable one runs out.My only beef with this camera is that in the \"Image\" mode, the display automatically turns on.  There is apparently no way to turn this setting off.  The only course of action is to depress the \"Display\" button twice to turn it off, and you have to wait two to three seconds to do so.  The reason I insist on taking pictures in this mode is because it has a \"Fast Shutter\" setting, which is *absolutely* necessary for taking pictures of a baby with flailing limbs (or now, a constantly moving toddler).  I've also used it to get some great shots of fish zipping by in tanks at the aquarium.  It really DOES make a difference.It is both a blessing and a curse that you must continue to depress the shutter button for a display of the picture you have just taken.  A blessing because if you don't WANT to see the picture, it doesn't waste the battery.  A curse because when you DO want to see the picture, you usually forget to hold the button down!  Usually, I'll take a series of pictures of various things and playback and delete ones I don't like, so it's not a problem.This camera takes GREAT outdoor pictures in bright light, very clean and crisp shots.  Indoor pictures are nice as well, but if there is not enough light you must remember to use the flash.  Sometimes the flash does not work if you are too far away from the subject, but that goes for almost all digital cameras.  The pictures are SO great, that we've stopped using our other \"expensive\" olympus semi-pro camera (circa 1998).  That one still takes great pictures, but the cannon takes great pictures at a higher resolution with more megapixels.  So we tend to use my camera for anything we intend to print out.While it's great that this camera takes type I and type II CF cards (ie: microdrives), it's not absolutely necessary to use one with this camera.  CF type I cards are so cheap now, that if you don't mind switching cards every now and then, you can use a few 128 MB cards or something similar.  128 MB cards hold ~35-40 high res pictures on one card.  The display will tell you it can hold 58, but it lies!  It usually takes off two pictures for each you take at the highest resolution.","Date":"May 31, 2002"}

Before I bought a digital camera I would take maybe a roll of film's worth of pictures in a year.  Since I got the S20 I have taken a couple thousand.  It's truly liberating to take 10 pictures of a scene and pick the best one, everyone's eyes are open, the dog is not in the way, etc.The S20 produces beautiful pictures, is simple to use and feels like a solid camera.  I have dropped it twice and it still works like a charm.  With a spare battery and a 128MB memory card I can take pictures all day long without a second thought.  The camera is a breeze to use.  My wife (who is not a technophile) easily thumbs through the menus and shows me the pictures of our baby that she has captured.My only regret is that I waited until I could afford it, I wish I had put it on a credit card a sooner and gotten more pictures of my child's first few months.","Date":"July 6, 2001"}

It will take a microdrive, which is something i haven't tried yet, but it sounds very interesting. And, if the rechargeable battery runs out, you can power up with off the shelf disposable batteries. (...)the main reason I like this camera is that it's the toughest little thing around. You can drop it on the ground, pick it up & it will still work.  I've already dropped my S-20 several times without any negative results. Well, enough already. If you want a tough little camera, that fits in a shirtpocket & takes extremely sharp pictures, then this one is a no - brainer. I guess the only reason they're selling this for so lttle is that it's going to be discontinued. If that's the case, then get it. It's a classic.","Date":"December 17, 2001"}

It has so many more features(black & white, landscape, night scenes, stitching images, & continuous shooting to name a few) and it is user friendly.  Family back home have gotten spoiled by the pictures I email to them almost daily.  The pictures come out very clear, but you do have to take the time to make sure that you have it on the right settings.  The images download quickly and I love being able to view the slide show on the tv.  It makes it easy to show pictures that have just been taken, in better detail, to family that may not have a computer.This camera has been a lot of fun and I do not regret the purchase at all.However,and this is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, I cannot get the editing software to work correctly and I was disappointed when I realized I was going to have to spend some more $ to get the supply kit. The supply kit is a must unless you have a room full of lithium batteries and even that wouldn't last you for long if you wanted to use this camera to its full capability.

Mine began after many months of research, checking prices, reviews, etc. I finally opted for the Canon Powershot S20. Working as a Picture Car Coordinator in the film industry, I needed a digital camera that had great resolution, the ability to download into my computer, and a capacity for volume. Kudos to Canon. This is the perfect tool. The memory flash cards serve as safety deposit boxes, storing the images until you need to download. Competetive pricing has the largest flash memory card well within discretionary budgets. The multi-function facets of the camera accommodate any given situation and need - indoor, outdoor, panoramic, photogenic, macro, whatever. Think tank included. You can even script a continuous visual scene with the thorough computer software. Be sure to get the auxiliary battery pack for recharging as it is indeed fuel hungry. It's worth the extra cost. This camera can assist the casual user with professional results. Also standup to the rigors of high demand  and expectation. Fun, fast, and easy to use. For the money, a best buy. The finished product is always outstanding. Look like a million, pay like pauper. This is the ticket to the big time in your field of vision.","Date":"April 22, 2002"}

{"Title":"The most useful digital camera on the market today.","Author":"Logan L. Lindquist \"llbbl\"","ReviewID":"RU5IFRWMPVYZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I see the average consumer having too primary needs for a digital camera. The first and most important in their mind is a tool to record those moments that need to last forever. This translates into a digital versus film because of the unparalled ability of digital to display the recorded image. These are the shots that include family and friends, everyday life. Other important factors in choosing a camera that will handle this aspect would be zoom and flash. From what I have seen of the performance of such a small camera, it does fine.I can't wait until canon makes SLR rangefinder digital cameras similar to the s20, but with the option of extended zoom capability. That would be cool.The second most important need that I can percieve is a camera that is portable enough that it is not a big deal to carry with you most of the time. This would be for those shots that the consumer says \"Oh that looks cool\". This camera fits the bill perfectly bieng the smallest on the market that is able to support a microdrive.I think toshiba recently released a 5 gig mircodrive. I can't believe how many pictures this translates to. Of course it costs almost as much as the camera, but for people whom are serious about recording a moment in their life, then the investment in the camera / rechargeable batteries / leather case / microdrive goes without saying.Hope this helps!","Date":"July 28, 2001"}

My other Camera is a G2 and admit the G2 is far better than the S20. As most will agree the battery is flat too soon to trust for more than 20 mins. I've built some Li-ion batteries for this camera and solved the problem. I now can run almost 3hrs. before  a charge in needed. Canon made a big mistake powering this with 5 AAA Ni-MH cells, should have been the Li-ion's like my G2. The G2 goes forever on a charge and the Li-ion batteries hold a solid charge with a very low rate of static dicharge.The S20 is still a valid camera in my bag and many of my local news photos are shots taken with my S20. Its been a solid kick around digital thats hit the floor many more times than any plastic model could ever take, and if its too heavy for some then I guess you'd be crying about why Canon made the case out of plastic. Yes I have dents in my S20 but the case is why my S20 has lasted the many miles and bumps it has. OK so the S20 is a basic camera in todays market but as a used 3.3MP (Amazon's, header incorrectly states 3.2)Digital its been time and road tested to be an Excelent example.","Date":"December 14, 2003"}

{"Title":"Awesome digital camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1DHXK4XMDQF32","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a first time user of a digital camera and I am awed by the outstanding quality of the pictures and the simple use of the camera.  I reviewed quite a few different companies and cameras before settling on the  Sony FD-90.  Originally one of my criteria was size.  Yes the Sony FD-90 is  a little bulky because of the standard floppy drive but all in all it is  just a little bigger then an ordinary 35mm camera and is probably lighter  in weight.  I use my FD-90 for work (and for play) and one of the features  I enjoy is being able to make copies of the disks on the spot and to hand  them out to other people at meetings.  The floppy disk makes this camera  absolutely simple to use.  Shoot a picture and put the disk in your  computer and the picture is there as quick as your computer can access the  floppy drive.  No cables to hook up!  I have not used the new Memory Stick  with this camera although it is an available option.  For the price of  floppies I don't foresee needing anything else. I had considered the Sony  FD-88 but I saw a lot of reviews complaining about red eye in the pictures.  I was pleased to find on this FD-90 there is a red eye reduction feature  built into the flash and it actually works. Another feature I like is the  MPEG capability.  For me this feature is basically a toy and is really only  useful for placing small MPEG movies on a web site or for emailing. From  what I've seen in reviews of other cameras is that there is a problem with  battery consumption.  With the FD-90 you get a lithium ion battery and a  charger so there will be no problem with that.  I've been getting a full  hour of shots with a full charge.  Consider all the functions like flash  and zoom and these use battery life so an hour is pretty good.  I bought a  spare battery as well but so far have not had to use it. Overall I would  recommend this digital camera for everybody.  From the box it is very  simple to use.  You'll be up and running as soon as you get the battery  charged (you can read the manual while it's charging) and you'll be having  fun with this camera in no time at all.","Date":"June 14, 2000"}
{"Title":"Almost Perfect!","Author":"\"netzen7\"","ReviewID":"R3NAFRE4T46PO8","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this camera and the starter kit (extra higher capacity battery and carrying case) in time for a weeklong family vacation.  After shooting 2000 pictures and 200 video clips on $15 worth of floppy diskettes during the trip, I want to say this is a great camera.  The film developing costs saved on this trip alone could have paid for the camera!The mpeg movies are a great feature.I almost settled for the FD85, I'm glad we didn't because of extra features gained.  This camera is smaller and cheaper than the FD95, and smaller than our \"good\" SLR - but a bit bigger than the average point and shoot.The FD90 works completely auto with the full range of point and shoot features found on our similarly priced SLR, or you can \"cursor\" through the on-screen menus and set a number of options including exposure and white balance. The \"AE program button\" allows you to quickly select \"twilight mode\", \"twilight plus mode\", \"landscape mode\", \"panfocus mode\" or \"spot light-metering mode\".  The camera has a manual focus ring if you need to use it, and the flash can be set auto, manual on, manual off, or redeye. The camera also has a macro mode. I'm not a professional photographer, so I found myself playing with the manual settings learning what makes for a good photograph.  It is great getting instant feedback on the digital screen. If it didn't work, I just reviewed, deleted and tried again - something I've longed for using our SLR. This camera is as fun as it is useful!  The FD90 is an easy point and shoot - or if you want, you can control some of the action if you are just willing to read the manual and learn the controls.  The camera is capable of more than just point and shoot, but the controls are unique.Did I mention that this camera can also record short videos?No hassle floppy diskettes are almost free these days and are available almost everywhere, only Mavica cameras write directly to them.  Great feature when vacation down south got extended unexpectedly in winter months due to bad weather canceling flights back north. Windows 98/ME/2000 PC users don't need any additional software to view the pictures stored on the floppies - the camera creates an HTML page right on the diskette linking pictures and movies for easy viewing. There is also a freeware utility floating around the Internet specifically written for Mavica owning PC users that will thumbnail your shots if you are into quick website creations. You can zoom into and crop pictures, copy and format diskettes, etc. right on the camera so you don't need a PC to enjoy this camera - especially with the supplied cable that plugs directly into composite inputs on your Television/VCR. Regarding the resolution, I take most of my pictures on the lowest resolutions and they are still good - they print 3 x 5 no problem, even larger with very little distortion. On screen (or my TV with the supplied cable) they are great at the wimpy 640 x 480, especially with the camera in slide-show mode. Plug the camera into a VCR directly and set it on a tripod at family or church events and you have an extra camcorder! It's when you try to \"blow up\" a picture, or digitally zoom into a recorded shot that the extra pixels matter.I did take 20 or 30 pictures at higher resolutions, but rarely the highest.  After visiting with friends who are digital camera owners, a few with 2 mega pixel and higher possibilities, I'm hard pressed to believe most of us care for more than a mega pixel, as evidenced by the popularity of the Mavica FD73 that doesn't even have the ability.  If you are a true photography buff/professional, or have some specialized business need for super clarity, I can see the mega requirement. If you rarely venture beyond 200 speed 35mm film in your SLR, and you rarely deviate from dropping your film off at the local supermarket for developing doubles on 4 x 6 with an index print, lets be realistic. For me the pictures are for memories rather than for artistic impression, and with this camera I get hundreds where I used to get dozens. With the manual features I can tinker with art when so inclined. I almost forgot to mention the solarize, B&W, Sepia, and Neg.Art effects.Why not perfect?  Well, the shutter hesitation does take some getting used to, and the camera seems to struggle a bit in low lighting - although I'm not convinced I just haven't learned how to manually compensate with so many available options. I believe there is also an optional external flash. Lenses, external charger(s), memory sticks etc. are also available for this camera at an additional cost.Oh, ya, this camera makes MPEG movies, up to 60 sec of audio/video per 1.44 diskette in the low-res mode!  We researched several cameras, and I am very pleased with this purchase.  I think the Mavica FD90 has the best mix/compromise of digital camera features.  For me the FD90 has set the standard for all others to compare.  Sony has done it right.","Date":"December 28, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera","Author":"Thom Fitzpatrick","ReviewID":"R26TOG20IC7K0J","Overall":"good","Content":"I hemmed and hawed for quite a while before making the plunge to buy a digital camera.  I wanted something to use for online auctions, and take pix to use on my web site.  I had been taking analog pix, getting them developed, scanning them, and tossing them in a box.  I was going to get the FD-73, but decided I might want higher resolution, so I stepped up to the FD-90.  Wow!  The #1 selling point for me was the floppy disk storage; friends of mine have cameras with cables and whatnot, and it seems like a big pain.  I like not being tied to a proprietary hardware and software interface.  I can take pix in the car, and unload them at home, work, or at a friend's house.  If I need more \"film\" I can stop at any supermarket or office supply store and pick up a box of floppies.  Just this weekend, I took some pix of a car that a friend was selling, then just handed him the floppy to take home and upload to his own computer.  Now the kicker: this camera has MPEG movie capability, which I wrote off as a \"well, that's cool, but I probably won't use it\" feature.  I couldn't have been more wrong - that's the coolest thing about this camera!  In addition to the pix I took of the car, I also created a \"walk-around\" video as well! Downsides?  The zoom control is kinda awkward being on the front; they should have left it on the back, so you could work it with your thumb while working the shutter.  It takes a great deal of dexterity to work the zoom while shooting a movie.  The camera should also ship with the longer-life battery that's available as an option.  And they should ship some sort of protective case with it.","Date":"November 13, 2000"}

I have to say I prefer the FD-88, which is unfortunate as Sony seems to have  just stopped making it.My major beefs with the FD-90 are first that you  can only recharge the battery in the camera.  This really stinks.  I hate  having to place an expensive piece of equipment on a shelf while it acts as  a $20 battery charger.  What a waste.  The FD-88 came with a nice seperate  charger, which actually took up LESS room than the equipment included with  the FD-90, and you could go out and take pictures with a second battery  while the first charged.  Can't do that any more.Secondly, the FD-90  pauses and freezes the image while you're focusing to shoot, which is  really disorienting to me.  Not to mention it doesn't get the fine-tuning  in auto-focus on close-up subjects, even using the Macro option.  I was  really disapponted in that.I've used the FD-88 a lot, and the FD-90 was  a new toy to try out (my company bought it).

I feel I can review the FD90 because it is so similar to  the FD88,  and is an improvement over mine in a few important respects. The  cameras are identical otherwise, except that Sony has made the FD90 into  1.6 megapixel instead of 1.3. This increases the resolution for larger  prints and when you compress them (say to e-mail), they won't be grainy.  Sony has also added their memory stick capability - a great feature. Let me  tell you about my FD88 and since the FD90 is even better, you can judge for  yourself. The Sony Mavica FD88 is a terrific digital camera, especially for  someone new to the genre and not necessarily extremely Computer literate.  It takes great shots and the floppy disk storage medium is very easy to use  and download to your PC. While its rated 1.3 million pixels is not as high  as some other high level models from other manufacturers, in reality not  too many people are going to appreciate much of a difference; the pictures  look great, crystal clear, and very professional. Since the FD90 is  improved in several respects over an already terrific camera, including  somewhat higher resolution (1.6 million pixels), the FD90 has to be a real  winner. The memory stick capability is an added bonus - especially if you  buy the memory stick-floppy disk converter. Then you can store literally  dozens of shots.

You don't find this zoom on all digital cameras.2. The save/display with floppies is much faster than with the memory stick.. memory stick is hands down better for taking a bunch of pictures, but if you are in a quick moving situation, switch to the floppies, and expect 6-10 pictures per disk on a medium resolution.4.

Of course the bells and whistles are OK, the MPEG's are fine and it takes great pictures at maximum resolution.  There is no reason for it to even have the 640 X 480 or email resolutions, the pictures are horrible. In those resolutions, the subject has a \"halo\" around it or them, the faces looked wrinkled and the picture is of overall poor quality.

Further, I use the memory stick and it takes forever to load a picture and transferring 70 or 80 pictures from the disk to the computer hard drive takes 4 to 5 minutes. Folks, this camera is just plain clunky and there are many digital cameras out there at half the price that will do as good or better of a job.  Caveat Emptor!!!!","Date":"October 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Digital Camera Replacement","Author":"\"lavonneg@aol.com\"","ReviewID":"R3691SW5LZ1YH","Overall":"good","Content":"In October 1997 I purchased one of the first versions of the Sony Mavica camera -- the FD7 model -- and I have replaced it with the FD90 model.  The main reasons I purchased this camera was 3.5\" storage and the versatility of the 'jpeg' files in Windows-based software.  While easy to understand HOW to use, the camera itself is awkard WHEN used (especially compared to the FD7) as you need to use the same hand to grip the camera and work the controls.  The 'mpeg' movie feature is a definitive plus!","Date":"November 23, 2000"}
{"Title":"Best Bet For Schools","Author":"A Teacher","ReviewID":"R2CZXNUJE7JDZQ","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is your best bet if you are purchasing a digital camera for a school because of its ease of use and portability. Teachers check this camera out from our circulation and turn the camera back in....meanwhile they have the floppy in their classroom or at home manipulating their pictures while the camera can be checked out to someone else! No down time with this camera while it sits in a teacher's classroom connected to a cable waiting for her to have time to upload the pictures to her computer...at school or at home. And soooo easy to use....all of my teachers know how to retrieve information from the A drive. The kids love the instant gratification of seeing the pictures printed when they come back from lunch....it is that easy. The only downside, that I have yet to figure out, is the pause when it takes the picture. When the button is pressed there is a 2 second or so pause until the picture actually captures, so you may not be getting the picture that you thought you were getting. But that would not stop me from buying another one for our school!","Date":"October 21, 2000"}

My camera is a key component of my livelihood, and I can say unequivocally that the FD90 is the best camera for online merchandise photos out there.  It may be a little bulky for outdoor everyday use, and the internal charger would be quite limiting for a vacation camera.  But I never unplug my camera, so that makes no difference to me.There is no more convenient medium for storing and ultimately editing photos than a floppy disk.  It eliminates steps, and when you are doing 20 or 30 items at a time, it can make a real difference.But the big advantage is the quality of the photos.  My shots are demonstrably better than my competitors (my eBay seller ID is we_r_auktiononline so check for yourself).  This camera has the all important macro feature for closeups, and I still marvel at the clarity of the closeups.

{"Title":"Among the elite digital cameras in the market right now.","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R204R6QP655TL","Overall":"good","Content":"After a long month of researching cameras, I finally decided to buy this one. If you are seriously considering this camera, look around for prices, as they vary greatly from one place to the other. First of all, while this isn't a true 4.3MP camera, I think it outperforms 3.3 and 3.1MP hands down. THe resolution, color warmths, color accuracy and sharpness is amazing for a camera of this size...or for any digital camera any size. I have had this camera for a month now and I have never been so proud of an electronics purchase...of course I love my Mac too! Here is a list of PROS and CONS:Pros - The retraction of the lens which gets covered by a metal door is excellent. - The flash works surprisingly well. I used the camera in Times Square in New York (for those who don't know where Times Square is), and the faces came out with a good amount of light, while the backround lights of Times Square came out very nicely also. This camera takes VERY impressive night shots. I think it does better when it is set to AUTO than when it is set to NIGHT mode, although you can create some pretty funky shutter delay shots and play with lights and colors. - The Movie mode is great! Sure, it is not broadcast quality, but what did you expect. I think it takes better movies than the Sony Mavicas. - The USB connection is great. The smart media compartment works well too. - YES! You can set a timer to take pics..up to five seconds I think. - Looks like it came from the Matrix - Want flash? Pop it up. Don't want flash, pop it down. It is the easy.No buttons to press, no setting to set. - Many ISO to choose from, as well as Macro - TOP .JPG resolution is great. Don't be fooled that it doesn't save in .tif formats, the pictures are great! And saves space! - Comes with 16MB card, not 8MB like most of the other guys.CONS - The LCD display is difficult to see in bright sunlight, but at least you can use the viewfinder, unlike the Sony Mavica. - The camera KILLS alkalines, even the ultra alkalines. Don't be stupid. Use the NiHM, 4 are included with the camera, but I suggest going to Radio Shack and buying a quick charge charger. It'll same you lots of money and time, as the included charger takes 12 hours, and only holds 2 batteries. - I would've liked to see Fuji use the IBM Microdrive in this unit. With soo many memory hungry applications in this camera (movie capture with sound, high resolution images), even the 64MB card which I bought wasn't enough for a weekend with buddies in NYC.Conclusion: I showed the images of the trip to my boss, who is a hardcore Sony maniac. He was soo stunned by the quality and features, and price and size of the camera that he bought one for himself! You can't go wrong with this camera. I love it! And so do the editor's of Popular Photography magazine, who recently gave this model its highest review about it's color accuracy.","Date":"December 5, 2000"}

{"Title":"A Good, Basic Camera","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R269CHU73VELG8","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this after using a Sony Mavica for about six months.  I loved the Mavica, but wanted better quality images.  This camera has filled that bill very well.Is it perfect?  No, I believe Fuji could have done some things better.  I get error messages from my PC when I use the USB port to  transfer images to my computer, but the images do seem to come across  without error.  When I use the viewfinder, I see only about 75% of the  image that's photographed.  That is, the viewfinder trims off a pretty good  sized border.  Some have referred to this as a 4.7 meg camera.  Perhaps so,  but the quality is about the same as a 2.5 meg camera.The camera is  small.  For someone with big hands, such as me, this took some adjusting  to.  Once I adapted, the controls became easy to use.Photos are stored  in jpeg format, so there's some loss of quality in the image, but I take  all my shots in fine mode, and haven't noticed any problems.  I've not seen  any of the jaggies that I'd occasionally see in the Mavica images.All  images are taken and stored in color.  I wish the camera had a B&W  mode, just to save on disk space when I'm working on that kind of  image.Even so, it does quite a good job, in my opinion. This  is a basic camera.  You won't be able to connect lenses or filters to it.  About the only thing that you'll wish to buy afterward is some additional  memory and perhaps a carrying case.  I suspect that, for most buyers, this  camera will take care of all of their needs.  Others may use it for a  while, and then decide to go on to bigger and better things.  I sold my  Mavica FD-83 when I bought this camera.  I'll probably keep this one when I  move on to a bigger and better product.","Date":"July 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Tiny camera performs like a champ!","Author":"Sean Kelly \"Consultant\"","ReviewID":"R3BOA4LOXSU7PJ","Overall":"good","Content":"It's hard to imagine that such a tiny little camera can take brilliant 2400 by 1800 full color digital images, yet it does so extremely well!I bought my Fujifilm FinePix 4700 mostly for my impending baby.  As a simple,  point-and-shoot digital camera, it fits the bill perfectly.  A fully  automatic mode with a preview screen lets you compose great-looking shots  quickly.  Despite the camera's size, its zoom lens pops out to a 108mm (3x)  view.  (And you can digital zoom at lower resolutions.)  There's even a  popup flash on top.If you want a more controlled shot than the fully  automatic mode or the preprogrammed portrait, night scene, or scenery  modes, you can go to a fully manual mode, enabling you to adjust ISO  \"film\" sensitivity, metering, exposure value, white balance,  macro mode, and even manual focus.Depending on how much memory you've  put in (it uses Compact Flash cards), you can even take a minute long or so  JPEG movie, complete with sound.  A tiny built-in speaker lets you watch  and hear the movie you just took on the camera itself.By plugging a  computer's USB cable into the camera, you can transfer pictures and movies  out of it at high speed.  The camera includes Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home  edition for editing.  Or you can view your masterworks on a TV screen using  the A/V output port and cable that comes in the box.What really  impresses me is how Fujifilm fit all these features into such a small  package.  The camera's light and fits into the palm of my hand just right.  Holding the camera takes a little getting used to, and you do have to be  careful not to cover the autofocus transducer-thingamajig.  But it's not  uncomfortable at all.When turning the camera off, the lens retreats into  the body of the unit and a metal cover slides into place, protecting it  quite effectively.The only major drawback is the battery usage.  It's  quite easy to burn through its two AA-sized rechargeable NiMH batteries  before you've even filled up a 32MB flash card.  Leaving the LCD display  screen off and using the viewfinder instead definitely helps prolong  battery life.  The box luckily includes four such batteries (plus a  charger), so you can carry a spare set with you, or recharge two batteries  while using the other two.Overall, I'm blown away at how far  miniaturization technology has progressed.  The features and performance of  the camera are great---but to have all that in such a tiny box is  absolutely amazing.","Date":"June 21, 2000"}

Fraser","ReviewID":"R28JV5CCD02AGO","Overall":"good","Content":"If you are looking for a quality digital camera that can replace replace a 35MM at less the $1000.00, you found it. The picture quality is just fantastic, it is very easy to use, is loaded with features and the USB and  smartmedia storage disks make it painless for photo storage and transfer. I  was looking for a 2+ mega pixel camera (this unit is 4.7!) that was small  in size (about 1 1/4in think and could fit in my pocket), had USB and  smartmedia disk storage, a 2\" LCD screen, a optical view finder, an optical  zoom lens for less then $1000.00.  This is one impressive camera. I have  been experimenting with it for about a week now and have tested all its  many modes. The ONLY weakness where a high end 35mm can out shine this unit  is in very high-speed action. I was not able to adjust the shutter speed to  freeze the blades of a spinning fan, I could do this w/ my 35mm. BUT IN  EVERY OTHER CATEGORY I think this unit is easier to use and produces as  good if not better then most 35mm. I am not kidding.  A few notes:  Batteries last a lot longer then other dig cameras I have seen due to power  saving features,  The optical zoom is nice (3:1) It has a night mode that  takes great night shots. It has a nice macro mode (for close up photgraphy)  A portrait mode that has great skintones. A landscape mode that config's  the unit to take great outdoor very sharp images of scenery.  Built in  flash autotimer and alot more! Short movie capability w/sound! It is a  small AVI format movie (only 320X200) but it is great for a short clip to  email to a friend. It very easy to use. It has easy to use software for  your PC.2 LCD panels, a 2\" one for photo viewing and a circular one  for camera operation.Modes of operation. There are 3, fine normal and  basic. Use normal for just about everything, except a special shot that you  know you plan to blow up then go to fine. The normal mode is nearly as  clear and sharp as the fine except when enlarged. In a 4X6 test series I  took no one could tell the difference between the 3 pictures. The Default  is set at 2400X1800 \"file size\" (2400x1800, 1280X960, and 640X480 are the  choices (IMO use 2400x1800) and quality set to normal. This is the best  choice IMO (normal w 2400X1800 file size) for most if not all shots. In  this mode you can store 77 photos on a 64MB disk! (19 on the 16 MB) (In  basic mode from 180-996 images on a 64mb disk) Transfering the photos to  your computer is a snap. When you plug in the USB cable to you camera the  software fires up and you see the pics. Click and drag to where you want  them. I also bought the Snadisk smartmeadia reader so I don't have to use  the camera to transfer them. (Looks like a mouse with a 2 in slit in it)  These smart media storage cards are the way to go..the y are about the size  of a large postage stamp and about that thick too and hold 64 MB. I can't  say how pleased I am with this product. I think this is the first real step  in consumer digital cameras that will rival any 35mm out there.  To date I  have been printing them on my HpR80 office jet (an ink jet) w/ suprisingly  good results. My next purchace will be a dedicated dye sub photo printer.  But the inkjet does a great job. Viewing the photos on the computer screen  or on a big screen TV is a blast.  Go digital, it is the way to go... it  really is quite good now and reasonably priced.Good luck to you.

{"Title":"Fuji FinePix 4700 vs. Canon Elph","Author":"Erwin Grellmann","ReviewID":"R23DRC7VRH0UCI","Overall":"good","Content":"The FujiFilm FinePix 4700 zoom is my second FujiFilm digital camera.  I took a close look at the new small and cute Canon Elph.  But the Elph gives up some important features for the same price.  Make no mistake, this is a fine camera and I am awed by the flexible features packed into such a small size.  Here are some features that I have have found invaluable:PROS o The Photograph Mode Dial feature is one step up from a fully auto point and shoot camera.  I am very impressed by the Portrait, Landscape and especially the Night Scene modes.  They are optimized settings and take exceptional pictures under those conditions. I found it easy to twist the dial, shoot, then compare results taken in different modes.  Dramatic.  For me this is the single most useful feature of this camera, its implementation is easy and effective.o Generally, for film speeds of ISO 100 you have to keep the camera very still for sharp pictures.  So a faster film speed as this FinePix camera has is a big advantage. This camera has a base film speed of ISO 200 and settable up to ISO 800. (Canon is ISO 100)o Get as large a LCD display as possible.  This one has a 2 inch screen (vs. 1.5 for Canon).  If you use the LCD for framing a shot or to review a shot taken, a nice large screen is worth the extra size in a the camera.o Stay away from unique batteries.  More than once I have wanted to take that \"must have picture\" only to have forgotten my spare batteries in the car, or to find that they were dead.  AA size batteries can be found anywhere, even if you have to take a flashlight appart to get that important shot.  These NiH batteries are 1/10 the cost of Canon's Li batteries.I have owned the FinePix 4700 for one month now.  The FinePix is much more efficient in battery use compared to the older FujiFilm DX-10.  FinPix uses 2 batteries vs. the 4 in the DX-10, and lasts just as long.  This makes it possible for the camera to be lighter by 2 batteries.o The 3X zoom is very nice.  Canon has only 2x (although in Japan I have now seen an Elph with 3x zoom).oSmartMedia seems to be more available and prices are coming down.  If you haven't already discovered, SmartMedia with a PCMCIA adapter is the perfect replacement for floppy discs, especially if you own a notebook computer.CONS oThe viewfinder is small, especially if you wear glasses.  Using the veiwfinder does save on battery power, so hopefully FujiFilm will address this in the next model.  Then I will give it 5 stars.o After one month of heavy use, the Auto Focus does not work and the camera is broken.  I have been unable to get through the busy phone lines at Fuji Film in Edison NJ.  At the moment I have given up trying to get through.  Fortuantely, I live in Japan where service is still first class and the local Fuji dealer accepted my camera for warranty repair.  It will take a month ;-(  Take notice Fuji Photo Film America!  Answer your phone lines and voice messages!","Date":"May 19, 2001"}

The weaknesses are: 1) It eats batteries. The first accessory I bought was a MAHA MH-C204F home/car charge and two sets of 1600mAh batteries. The second was the AC adapter for use while dumping the pix to the computer. 2) There is significant barrel distortion on wide angle shots. This is widely reported, but should not be considered a show stopper. 3)The AVI files generated in movie mode appear to be non-standard. After installing the Fuji S/W to my machine, Windows Media Player handled these just fine.

I had the camera up and running in <5min and was transferring outstanding pictures to my NT2000 laptop in <10min.  A brief reading of the manual unlocked all of the camera's secrets.  The camera provides for control over both pixel count (640x480 to 2400x1800) and image quality (basic-normal-fine).  With the included 16MB chip you get ~49 images at 1200x960 using normal quality -which look great!  However, image count drops to 8 at highest settings.  Definitely thinking about a 32 or 64 MB chip.  Red-eye reduction flash is a little sketchy, still some residual effect.  Only real disappointment is poor battery life when using alkaline batteries -REALLY BAD.. I barely was able to run the set up and have enough power for 4 or 5 flash pictures.  Good thing they included 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries (80-230 shots depending on flash and LCD usage).  My 'old' camera is a Nikon 35mm FM2 and although you could argue that it's comparing apples and oranges, I have no regrets over transitioning to this Fuji digital!","Date":"November 28, 2000"}
{"Title":"It's small, great pictures, and did I mention it's small","Author":"Ken Kaplan","ReviewID":"RZSRNSX6BT6WO","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is small and light.  It takes great pictures.  Both the clarity is great and the color is vibrant and on the mark.  As a bonus it takes Quicktime movies that you can send over the net if the receiver has a fast connection.  Talking about fast, the download from the USB connection is speedy.  Plus there is little delay after taking the picture until the picture is downloaded and the camera is ready to shoot again.  The camera comes with two sets of rechargeable batteries and the recharger.  Very nice.  But for me, other than the quality of the pictures, I love the size.  I bought the camera for the family, and I don't want to lug a bulky Nikon, so this fits the bill.The only problems that I have experienced are due to the size.  The optical viewfinder is small.  The flash needs to be popped up manually even in auto mode.  That really annoys me since my wife continues to forget to pop up the flash and we get dark pictures.  Hey Fuji, auto should mean auto on the flash too.  Also, you got to watch how your right hand grabs the camera so that you don't cover the auto focus or light reader eye.Obviously, with five stars I am very happy with the camera.  If your not getting good pictures don't blame the camera.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great camera","Author":"Jeff","ReviewID":"R324IBBAWOGZ36","Overall":"good","Content":"I did alot of research before buying this camera. I was looking for a camera that had three specific qualities. 1)Easy to use for the beginner. 2) Produce quality 8' x 10\" photos. 3) Movie mode. This little Fuji fits the bill in all three categories and on top of that the price is very reasonable compared to other cameras and I definitely like its distinct, compact look. To me, it has an oldtime European look to it. This camera produces very high quality photos using its highest setting. I would prefer a stronger flash for indoor shots but for outdoor shots its perfect. The colors on outdoor shots are just amazing. This little camera only uses (2) AA batteries instead of the typical 4. The batteries do last surprisingly long. I was able to click off 36 high resolution shots with flash and LCD screen on and power lasted over an hour. The batteries that come with it are excellent at 1600 mah. I also picked up some rechargeable Monster Cable AA's from 800.com, they are 1800mah and are very long lasting. NOTE: I couldnt wait to for the batteries to charge when i got the camera so I used some duracells. I went through a 4 pack in 10 minutes. Only use these batteries in dire emergency situations. They are not meant to be used for digital camera no matter how much they claim to be. At first the controls on this camera seem complex, but once you actually get into using it you find out how logical the placement of the controls are. Just spend one hour with the manual and camera and you will be an expert on this camera. Also, you can hook this camera up to your TV and play the movie back and do a slide show of all the pictures. I did this for family members at a get together, took orders of who wanted which picture and then printed them out so they would have instant photos of only the ones they wanted. Big WOW factor there! I am sure there are better digital cameras out there, but if you are looking for the criteria that I listed and want get it at a great price this is the one.","Date":"September 19, 2001"}

Would prefer more extreme close-up capability.  About 18 inches is as close as you can get.  Detail in high resolution mode is incredible.  Always sharp pictures except in closest close up mode.  NO warning indicator when you have gotten too close on close-ups.  So they end up  fuzzy.But, no worries - just erase it and do it over.Controls can be easily bumped to the wrong setting without  realizing it.

{"Title":"Quite Satisfied","Author":"Graham Bruce O-Field","ReviewID":"RL9UY4JT7SQ4B","Overall":"good","Content":"The FinePix 4700 offers an excellent combination of: - convenient size (handy leather pouch fits on the belt) - high resolution (3 different resolutions and sizes) - easy interface to computer with the USB - good performance under difficult lighting etcIt gets 4 stars from me and not 5 stars because: - has no wide angle mode.  Can't take panorama pics.  Quite a pity because the wider angle is especially useful for interior shots.  And the Panorama would also be great to have - more zoom would be useful - a little more closeup would be useful in macro shots.Other points: - don't get fooled by the so-called 4.7mil pixels - this is an extrapolation and represents no real increase in resolution over the approx. 2.3 mil pixels available.  A less deceiving name for the camera would be FinePix 2300. - the leather pouch would be greatly improved if it had a little space to comfortable accept 2 extra batteries, since an extra set should always be on hand when travelling.-  get the larger sized memory card and get an extra one too (fits in the leather pouch nicely).I use my FinePix 4700 to document my work.  It sees almost daily use.  I am very satisfied with the product.  When travelling I have 2 memory cards and can take up to about 50 high resolution photos (which I rarely use), about 300 or so medium resolution photos (which I usually use) and something like 1000 or so low resolution photos (which I rarely use since they are VERY low resolution)  If they could get a wider angle and panorama then it would suit my purposes exactly.  As it is I am nevertheless quite satisfied with my purchase.","Date":"May 19, 2001"}

{"Title":"Pleasant Surprise","Author":"Don Schwirtlich","ReviewID":"R3RS2OHEKUC9MX","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a very good camera - I bought it right before a couple of grandkids came along.  My wife has been ambivalent about digitals because she wanted quality shots like she gets from her 35 milimeter camera.  The quality I get from this camera (and I am a picture taking amateur) is at least as good as she gets with her quality 35.  The batteries do a good job compared to my other digital camera.  I would suggest the 64 mg memory card.  With it, you get 38 highest res pictures at a time.  Also, the usb transfer is so much similar that what I had with my old digital.  My son bought the high end Sony (the fd95) and this Fuji takes as good pictures, the difference is that he gets 10x zoom.  I wish I had 10x zoom - but he wishes he had back the $500 more he spent on his camera than I spent on mine.","Date":"April 21, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great pick","Author":"ARuslan \"mdljukka\"","ReviewID":"R3KY3JUVAAK2ZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera about two weeks ago. It's an awesome camera.  The picture quality is very, very good.  A friend of mine had this camera for about a year, and he recomended it to me.  I've been taking pictures with it around the city and at some clubs, it's great. The movie option is very cool, you can capture up to 80 seconds of the movie.  The nightscene feature is also very cool.  I took some pictures at a club, where the lighting was very low, and if there's light's in the background, or moving light, the picture comes out with a cool trail effect. It also has a manual mode.  The only thing about this camera is that the batteries run out kind of fast, but what can you do it's a high powered device.  So if I was going to go out I'd take an extra set of batteries with me.  This camera takes 2 1450 mah, or 2 1600 mah NI-MH rechargable batteries, it also takes NI-CD batteries.  Monster Cable makes 1800 Mah batteries, but when I called Fuji, they said that those weren't recomended to use with this camera.  You can get a charger set with 4 batteries ...  Also in the manual and on the box it says that this camera accepts up to 64Mb SmartMedia Card, but on here in the accesories it says that you can go up to 128mb, and Viking support center said the same thing. I purchased the 128mb card and it works just fine. At 1280x960 resolution with fine quality I can take 204 pictures, which is more then enought.  I would also recomend getting a SmartMedia Card reader which conects through the USB port.  That way you don't drain the batteries when you're transfering pictures from the card to your computer, and it also works faster.  For the price I'd say that this is the best choice.","Date":"April 6, 2002"}
{"Title":"I have had no regrets about buying this camera","Author":"\"isaacforman\"","ReviewID":"R38MEHZM9YCE2A","Overall":"good","Content":"I shopped around for my first digital camera (also looking at Canon and Olympus models) with the following primary criteria: ease of portability, quality of images, and ease of use.Firstly, this camera is a great size, making it easy to carry wherever you go. I wanted the freedom to take photos without processing delays and costs, and also the freedom to carry a camera wherever and whenever, and it has certainly been possible with the 4700z. The zoom lens retracts and is automatically covered when you turn off the camera, making a lens cap and/or strap completely unnecessary. The flash also pops down when not in use.The quality of the photos produced by the 4700z is exceptional. You will immediately notice (especially on a nice day outside) the vibrant colours and clarity. I have had success with the macro mode and the optical zoom also (remember not to factor digital zoom into your purchasing decision with *any* camera).The camera is also very easy to use. You can hand the camera to someone, point out a few buttons (mostly zoom and save/discard), and they'll have no problem in taking a great photo.Buy an extra storage card or two (I have 2 32's and the 16 which came with the camera), and take both sets of batteries when you go out for the day. When taking photos at sporting events, try to get closer to the action rather than relying on the zoom - when you zoom, you accentuate player movement, and also your own movement. Also, try using it with a tripod - I've taken some good photos during the day or at night with a tripod.Finally, the two problems I've discovered in 6 months with the camera have done nothing to put me off it. I would happily make the purchase again if given the opportunity. The two problems have been: left-most button around the secondary LCD requires more force to push than the others; and the flash often needs a nudge to pop it up. Both pretty minor issues.","Date":"July 17, 2001"}
{"Title":"Fuji 4700","Author":"Leslie Jones \"bonanza66p\"","ReviewID":"R9CNI6ZXMNZBA","Overall":"good","Content":"The Fuji has most of the good ergonomics of the earlier model but they have mysteriously changed the battery system. Both the Fuji and the Leica models had an internally chargeable battery which lasted well and was very convenient. The 4700 requires AA batteries-if you use the screen, they will not last long. I've also found frequent and vexing problems with the camera not wanting to accept smartmedia cards it previously used. This is intermitent but annoying enough to warrant testing a card before you rely on it. The camera is a nice weight and produces great pictures but I am not sure that it's a quantum leap over its predecessor.","Date":"December 19, 2000"}

But be prepred to have 2 or 3 sets of fully charged batteries on hand, as you can't get through a smart card on a set of 2 batteries. Nor can they be charged in the camera, so the downside is having to travel with lots of (rechargeable) batteries and the charger, and perhaps an extra one for the car.

I shoot about 50 rolls of film per year and my regular equipment includes top of the line Nikon's and Canon's cameras and lenses.  So my expectations of picture quality from a digital camera were pretty high before I bought the Fuji 4700.  My decision to buy Fuji was based on high resolution spec of 4.3 Megapixels. I was very pleasantly surprised with Fuji 4700.  Everything I was looking for in terms of camera's feature and capabilities is there and more.  The greatest surprise came however when I printed my first photos.  I have a relatively inexpensive Canon Photo Printer BJC-8200.  Unless you look real close (like 10 inches or closer) the quality of 8x10 prints is virtually indistinguishable from analogs.  I found out that the key to great picture quality is to use high quality glossy paper -- I use the same paper that came with the Canon printer (I think it is made or marketed by Canon).  I had mixed results with other brands although I am sure there must be some brands that are equaly good or even better.  Bottom line, I love Fuji 4700.  It is fun to use and gives great results. If I had to improve one thing it would be the curved handle on the front of the camera--it does not feel 100% comfortable but given everythinhg else, it is a minor inconvenience. I guess Fuji recognized that and fixed it in the 4800 model.","Date":"June 14, 2001"}

It's quite handy... the size is really nice, and the lens retracts into the case with a real metal shutter to protect it. The user interface is decent, and the LCD is readable in most conditions. The second \"control\" LCD was a cool design, allowing the user to reuse buttons in both camera and playback modes.I have to agree with others that the image quality is good, but perhaps not to the levels that I've seen with the real 3MP cameras. This is certainly not a true 4MP camera... look at it as a 3MP camera that makes bigger files.I needed to find the manual, since I was borrowing the camera from a friend. I went to fujifilm.com, and was really disappointed with the offering -- I couldn't even find a _mention_ of this camera, let alone drivers/software/manuals!

The manual focus requires pushing buttons rather than rotating a lens like standard cameras.  It is difficult to do.  The auto focus feature consists of two steps.  You line the subject in the center of the viewfinder and press the shutter button halfway.  It sets the focus and then you can click the button fully to record the image.  The problem I had with it is that by the time the camera \"set\" the focus, my subject (a 10 month old) was in the next room.

The colors are pretty. Compared with a Kodak, the colors are muted, easier on the eyes. The Kodak looked like a TV screen with the brightness and contrast overdone. I used it for about a year, and it quit. I must admit that I had dropped it hard once, and it had just gone through a mountain approach during a high wind advisory (I take it in my light plane). So, I really can't fault the camera. Turned out it needed a new flash board. Took 5 weeks and [amt] after sending it to Fuji NJ. I don't consider that bad service, and something you should think about before buying an off-brand asian wonder. I doubt any corner camera shop is doing to do much to a digital beyond cleaning.2400x1800 is great for digital zooming later. Or, for printing, but it is impolite for sharing photographs due to the upload time. It has 9 resolution settings. Three for # of pixels and within them three compression settings. I set it on 1280x960 and average compression. This gives me 99 pics on the supplied 32meg card, about 250k per pic, and great picture quality. The only criticism I can think of is that the flash stinks. I like a bounce flash, and this doesn't have the option. Red eye galore. You have to edit it out later. However, anything with a better or external flash is a lot bigger, so choose your tradeoffs.Scott","Date":"December 30, 2001"}

The USB drivers that come with the software won't work on Windows 95 (tried it with on an HP pavillion computer). Ended up buying a smartmedia card adapter that allows the card to be read from the floppy drive which works great....Also the camera is a little akward to hold, its not in the shape of a normal camera. and the lens zoom button is not the easiest to use either (it is on the back of the camera). The microphone for the AVI recording is on the left side of the camera, and its pretty easy to accidentally put your hand over it if holding the camera with both hands.The batteries also take a long time to recharge - 13 hours. Fortunately it came with two sets.The initial AVI clips we made didn't look that good when  viewed in quicktime 4.0, but when they played in the windows media player, it looked a lot better.  I didn't have time to figure out why.This camera was chosen for the better low light sensitivity (ISO 800) and the 3x optical zoom.

{"Title":"Great camera. But with flaws","Author":"L. Sudairy \"Alexandra\"","ReviewID":"RCI4GVYAJW0K7","Overall":"good","Content":"I had this camera for 2 or 3 years now. I got it as a gift couple of months after it was showcased.  I will rate this camera according to when it was bought and according to the present time 2004.When Bought:  Great picture quality, has many different settings from basic to fine and also different options of resolutions from 640 to 2400. The manual mode is good, it allows you to control white balance, allows for manual zoom, and changing the ISO up to 800.  I mostly take pictures in this mode since the color is more true once you have adjusted these settings.  I think all settings stay saved for the exception of the manual focus which you would have to reactivate everytime you turn the camera on.  The video mode is great in full light yet it gives very low quality vidios if the indoor lighting is not bright.At the Present:I believe there are better cameras out there, yet this camera at its present price might still be attractive. The issue of focus error starting happening to me only after the camera slipped off of my hands once and landed on the ground. Eversince them I get this message everyonce in a while. The biggest disadvantage of this camera in my opinion is the speed of the shutter. It is quite slow.","Date":"December 15, 2004"}

{"Title":"\"Real world\" excellence","Author":"Daniel J. Zajic","ReviewID":"R3CYUO3FTNAK0D","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera cannot be appreciated based on its specifications alone. The intangible qualities are what make this camera an excellent choice for anyone simply wanting great quality pictures from a camera that operates like a film camera, but has all the advantages of a digital camera.- The pictures are excellent (especially the color), although low-light pictures are a little grainier than I would like.- The flash is VERY powerful considering the camera's small size.- Stainless steel body seems very durable, feels solid in your hand- Camera operates very fast: turning on/off, menu navigation, shutter/autofocus delay, flash recharge, switching modes. In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of any digital camera, and most don't have it!- Battery life is excellent! Only 2 AA's easily last for a day of normal use. I usually get at least 2 days out of them. Fuji has really shown their excellence in this area... the power saving features have obviously made a huge difference.Conclusion: If you want a: 3X optical zoom, pocket-sized camera, for everyday use, that works like a film camera (i.e. very easy to use, and fast), feels like a high-quality product (not a cheap plastic toy), you MUST get this camera. You WON'T be dissapointed.WARNING: If you want extensive manual control, DO NOT get this camera. You WILL be dissapointed....","Date":"May 2, 2002"}

{"Title":"First Digital Camera","Author":"Boatguy \"chris989\"","ReviewID":"R10MVTJXO1PKKC","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera, and after several months of research, I could not be more pleased with this purchase.  It is easy to use for a beginner but has enough advanced features that I don't anticipate that the average home / business user would outgrow it quickly.The menus are easy to navigate, even for someone not particularly adept at with the conventional functionalities of a digital camera.  In spite of its small size, it is sturdy and seems pretty durable.Definitely upgrade to a 64MB SmartMedia card and order extra batteries as well.  Battery life is acceptable but they do have a tendency to run down rather quickly (especially if the LCD screen is used a lot.)  The batteries are relatively inexpensive and it's nice that in a pinch, Alkaline AA batteries could be used.To date, I've taken over 200 photographs with the camera.  The performance is good and the cyle times between photographs and for power up are above average for a camera in this price range.  Printed photographs are excellent, even with a relatively low-end color inkjet printer utilizing photo paper.Besides the quality, it is just plain fun to use and generally gets a \"wow.. cool camera\" comment from others.If you are considering a digital camera, this one should be on your short list, especially at the current price.","Date":"June 20, 2001"}
{"Title":"Just another review","Author":"mitek","ReviewID":"R11SD95T4J67MG","Overall":"good","Content":"I did an extensive research on this camera, and had a chance to experiment with it for quite a while. The final impression is fairly positive, the good sides clearly outweight the weaker ones.Here is the summary.POSITIVE =================================================== * Very small and compact size, small weight (~300 gramm with batteries) * Excellent color representation. Colors are warm and natural. Probably, best color representation of any compact digital camera on the market. * Fast and 100% painless transition of images to computer; there is absolutely no need to by any additional accessories to that end. Camera mounts itself as a removable drive in Windows Explorer as soon as you plug it in, and you just copy the jpeg files. * Flash does not pop up by itself; no need to play \"outsmart the flash\" game. If you need to disable it, just close it up. * Uses smartmedia cards, which is the most compact media to date (less than 1mm thick) * All small features are extremely well thought-out, as always the case with Japanese companies; and yes, it does have a self-timer and tripod mounting screw.NEGATIVE ==================================================== * The main problem of this camera (and I have not seen this in any prior reviews here) is not the lower-than-advertized resolution (which is huge even as it is, at least equivalent to 2.5+ megapixels), but a so-called \"barrel distortion\". This effect is only present when the camera is set at the widest angle (that is, no zoom). Put simply, this means that if you're looking at a vertical wall at the widest angle, and this wall happens to be at the very side of a viewfinder, it will appear as somewhat swallen outside of the picture. All digital cameras are said to have this effect, but when I looked to check it on this camera, I was able to notice it clearly. If you zoom in, it disappears. Again, I was fully aware of this when I bought the camera, yet that did not affect my choice. * Picture quality is somewhat lower than it could be for this pixel count; it is certainly lower than advertised 4.3 megapixels. * no \"black & white\" mode; * monitor drains power quickly. however, keep in mind that it uses only 2 AA batteries instead of 4, as most of other digital cameras do, and maybe that's why this drain is more pronounced.CONCLUSION ================================================== Seems to be one of the best compact cameras on the market to-date. However, if I were a professional photographer, I'd get Fuji professional camera, Fuji Finepix S1 Pro for ... For everything other than professional photography, this camera is excellent.","Date":"November 21, 2000"}

{"Title":"No risk camera buy - great value for money","Author":"\"comares\"","ReviewID":"RNKB75B2LU46A","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the best buy I ever did!I bought the Gold millenium package of the Kodak DC215. It is exactly the same camera as the standard DC215, which comes in silver. It adds a 8MB flash card instead of 4MB and a fast USB  card reader. I regretted the purchase somewhat after I found out that my  two year old PC doesn't have a USB plug, so I have to use the serial cable,  which is also provided as a slower alternative. I also found the 8MB card  just too small for a weekend trip. Since digital pictures are essentially  'free', I tend to make more pictures than I used to. The 8MB card is good  for some 40 to 50 pictures. I am now thinking about a 64 MB card in order  to avoid laborious selecting and erasing of pictures on the road.  Altogether, after checking your PC, I recommend the silver DC215.I had  the camera working out of teh box in two minutes! Installing the PC  application was really easy and my first pictire was on the web in 15  minutes. The camera does consume power quickly. I found it unworkable with  4 standard AA batteries. I bought a charger and 8 Ni-Mh batteries from the  KODAK website. It is a great addition to the camera! The batteries are good  for two to three weeks vacation use. The charger is a really nice and  compact design; highly recommended!Now on the camera itself: It is an  amazing camera that makes crystal sharp picture beyond belief. Having had  12 normal camera's before, I know what it takes to make good pictures. This  camera has some outstanding features:  (a) an incredible wide angle which  allows for great indoor pictures  (b) a powerful flashlight that does a  great jobs under all circumstances. I normally works automatically, but can  be forced to flash, which gives really nice 'fill-in' light effects. (c)  incredible sharpness over the whole 'depth' of the picture. Nearby objects  (up to 3 inches, no kidding! ) and far away objects remain crystal clear  and sharp.  (d) a clear LCD that, after getting used to, is the best way to  take pictures (instead of putting the camear in front of your eye) (e) an  easy user interface on the camera to review pictures  (f) the TV cable is  just fun! It amazes people that you can see the pictures immediately on the  big TV screen.  (g) easy upload of JPEG files to attach to your emails.  With our family living in Europe this is a great feature that is really a  lot of fun. (h) The LCD screen shows the picture for 20 seconds after  taking it. This is a great feature on trips: Take a picture and show people  what it looks like and offer to send them it afterwards by email. It makes  friends quickly!Finally: if you're in the market today to buy a digital  camera, you have to realize the following. There are three price bands:  $300; $300-$550, and $550 and above. If you're a professional, you probably  do not read my review and you're in for the $550 and above category. If you  want 'something better than the rest', you should buy a camera of the  second category $300-$550. I warn you though, that cameras in that category  will decrease in price sharply and will cost only $300 in 12-15 months. So  my take is: buy a $300 camera. You will not be disappointed. And with the  Kodak DC215 you buy an amazing piece of equipment.","Date":"July 15, 2000"}

The camera was ready to go within minutes of opening the box and the software was simple  to install and had me downloading pictures to my web site within ten  minutes.I purchased the DC215 millennium gold due to the larger compact  flash (8mg) and the inclusion of the USB compact flash reader.

I recently toured Harpers  Ferry National Battlefield and took several pictures of the surrounding  scenery as well as group photos, and amazed the group by displaying the  pictures on the T.V. via the direct camera link as soon as we returned  home.  They turned out crisp, detailed and in perfect focus!The camera  is a little hard on AA batteries so I went out and bought lithium batteries  and have not had to replace them in over three weeks of constant use.

I just bought the  16MB Flash because I'm using the camea so much, so keep in mind that at  some point you may be dropping another $40-50 on memory, as the amount that  comes with the DC-215 is passable, but not spectacular.","Date":"July 25, 2000"}

I set my upper limit at $300 for the camera and began shopping. I looked at everything from $39 to $500. I spent hours on the internet reviewing cameras. I also scanned the Sunday sale ads waiting for the right camera and price to come together. It did. I bought a Kodak DC215 for $299. Included with the camera was a SanDisk card reader. I was ready to take pictures.I shot a few pics the first day and uploaded them to the internet. How easy! Over the first few days I took more pics and continued to upload to my album. I also set it up where anyone could view the pictures and/or order prints. My family, 600 miles away, can only call once in a while and say hello, but can enjoy the pictures on the internet whenever they wish.After uploading about 50 pictures I decided to order prints online. I'd heard so much about \"resolution\" and \"recommended print size\" that I was scared that I'd get very grainy prints in the mail. What I received (using the lowest resolution on the camera for the prints) were wonderful, glossy, 4x6 prints. Every bit as good or even better than from 35mm film. I was amazed at the quality.I later purchased a 32MB card for about $70. It holds up to about 485 pictures. I'll use this card when we're on vacation. I couldn't be happier if I'd spent $999 on this camera. The only drawback - it takes only snapshots. If you want telephoto or wide angle, etc, get a good 35mm and use film.

{"Title":"An excellent budget digital camera","Author":"David Thornber \"David Thornber\"","ReviewID":"RQZIBV5ZVFOFQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I wound up buying the DC215 while on holiday, after losing our old 35mm camera.  At the time, I thought I was getting a bargain at around 220UKP, but have since seen the camera back in the UK for the same price.  I wasn't aware that you could get such a well featured digital camera for this kind of money.The camera has a versatile range of flash settings, including 'fill in flash', 'red eye reduction' and 'no flash.'  The 'exposure compensation' feature is very useful in poorly lit conditions, when the flash would be inappropriate or useless.  The camera also features a 10 second self-timer and a macro facility.  The biggest shock is battery consumption - in fact, if you use disposable alkaline batteries in the DC215, you'll probably find that the cost per picture is higher than buying and developing 35mm film!  A decent collection of NiMh rechargables is an essential accessory, but there's no need to buy the Kodak brand ones.  I wound up buying a couple of sets of Uniross 1300mAh NiMh batteries, which work very well.  There's no reason why you can't use NiCd batteries if you already have them, but if you're buying especially for the camera, then the NiMh batteries are well worth the extra cost.The features which I found annoying (most of which have already been mentioned) include the capacity of the standard memory card (4Mb) the slow download speed via the serial cable, the limited capabilities of the 2x optical zoom, and the fact that the 'zoom' facility in 'review' mode does not allow you to zoom in far enough to check the detail of the picture (which is supposedly the whole point of the facility.)  In review mode, the camera shows the pictures in two stages - a low resolution (and very blocky) image is shown instantly when a picture is selected and, if the picture is left on-screen for a short time, this is overwritten by the high-resolution version.  Unfortunately, the camera also operates in this way when viewing the pictures through the video out connector - so each picture in the 'slide show' is first shown in blocky low-res, and then updated to full resolution after a short delay.The camera features a conventional viewfinder, which is normally adequate for framing up pictures.  It is also possible to switch on the LCD for a real-time view of the picture to be taken, although this is best avoided if possible as it severely drains the batteries.Output quality is very good, provided that you set the resolution to high.  For each resolution, there are three possible quality settings, which affect the amount of JPEG compression applied to the picture files.  For the technically minded, 'Best' mode generates JPEGs with a quality setting of 94% - 'Better' and 'Good' use 85% and 75% respectively.  Even at 3x magnification (on the PC screen) it is difficult to see the difference between the 'Best' and 'Better' settings, and for normal (1x) viewing, the differences between the three qualities are unnoticeable.  A 16Mb card will store roughly 65 'Best', 90 'Better', and 135 'Good' pictures in high resolution mode.  The camera displays an estimate of the number of pictures remaining on the card (based on current compression and resolution settings) although this figure tends to be on the conservative side.One bonus of the design is that the serial and video connections use standard jack plugs, and the leads are simply straight-through cables.  I have already made two spare serial leads, so I can download the camera at home, at work, or on the move (into my notebook PC) without having to remember to bring the cable with me.  All in all, it's not the perfect camera, but it's not far off - the only things really missing from my 'wish list' are a more powerful optical zoom, a USB port, and a better 'detail' viewer in 'review' mode.  For 220UKP, I'm not complaining!","Date":"March 22, 2001"}
{"Title":"Solid performer at a good price.","Author":"Rheumor","ReviewID":"RG29QFWU6R1SR","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a fine little digital camera for beginners or casual users. It looks good, has great balance in the hand, and offers enough features to make it fairly versatile. Aside from the recreational user, it might be an ideal camera for someone like a real estate broker who wants to have something handy in the glove compartment, but doesn't want to worry about a very expensive piece of equipment getting lost or stolen. The camera is not perfect, but it is a good buy. PROS: 1) Appearance, weight & balance. 2) Highly readable (and adjustable!) LCD display. 3) AAA batteries readily available...(2 sets of rechargeable would be great). 4) Optical (2x) zoom. 5) Switchable resolution settings:  a) 640 x 480 perfect for emails & websites.  b) 1,152 x 864 good enough for 5\" x 7\" prints. 6) Very good software package. 7) Kodak service & warranty. 8) Readily available CompactFlash memory cards. 9) Faster recovery btwn shots than most digicams. 10)Useful & handy lens cap.CONS: 1) Fixed focus lens (like old 110 cameras). 2) Limited (2x) zoom. 3) No USB connection to download shots to PC (this will make the purchase of a separate memory card reader a must). 4) Need for battery charger & rechargeables (to be practical).","Date":"February 13, 2001"}

Having scoped many different cameras, I have found this DC215 to be a great user friendly peripheral. If you know how to use a regular 35mm camera, this is no different. Picture quality is terrific. I use a HP 812 deskjet to print all my 4X7 prints. One item to keep in mind. Not necessary this particular camera, but with all, I suggest you purchase a compact flash card reader. This makes transfering all your images to your desktop in a snap. The cable provided with the camera is simply useless. If the DC215 interests you, Kodak has a package called Digital Camera Expansion Pack that comes with (4) AA rechargable batteries, compact flash card reader (serial connection), PCMCIA adapter, and a 8MB compact flash card for less than $100. Bottom line in shopping for a digital camera. If money is not an issue, hell go with the Top of the Line model. In the other hand, if you are me with limited spenting funds, make sure you look for a camera that has batteries which can be recharge.  Purchase a camera that comes with at least 4MB of memory.","Date":"January 8, 2001"}

At 4x6 the pictures are very good (detail & color).  At 5x7 some pixelization begins to become apparent.  At 8x10 pixelization is very apparent on most pics.  If you're taking pics with little detail (portraits and flowers and such) 8x10s are acceptable when viewed from a few feet away.  The built in flash does a real nice job.  NiMH batteries are a must.  I also find that the brand and capacity of the batteries varies greatly and will give you from minutes to a few hours of serious use.  I find that Rayovac 1600mah batteries give me the best service.  Of course using the built in LCD screen greatly reduces battery life.  I recommend carrying a spare set (4).  An upgraded compact flash card is also a must.  At the best resolution I get 56 images on my 16M card.  I find the JPEG format easy do deal with in most photo application programs.  The only drawback is the serial interface cable.  It takes a long time to transfer a large number of images to the Computer.  While I haven't yet purchased one, a USB compactflash reader would probably be a good idea.  The camera is very easy to use and the menu options are very intuitive.  (I've never read the manual past a brief lookover.)

{"Title":"I love photography, and I love this camera!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3MY1VFPCUFY4Z","Overall":"good","Content":"This little camera is a great performer.  The pictures are very sharp for it's one megapixel rating.  I have a 1200 X 1200dpi printer-I purchased a photo cartridge and I am amazed at the prints I am getting.  This camera recommends 5 X 7 enlargements for the best and highest resolution setting, but if you crop or save a picture with the Kodak Pictures Now Software (included with the camera) you can save it at the best and professional setting, and you will get some great prints-even 8 X 10. I think the color is dead on for outdoor shots.  I bought the lens adapter from Kodak that allows for 37mm screw on filters;  have UV, Polarizer, ND6, ND9, & FLD for flourescent light-if needed. But Kodak has a great lens coating on their lens; my indulgence in the extra filters was lagnaippe for me-many shots (most all) need no filter at all.  Kodak Pictures Now software is very good, enabling you to crop, set brightness or contrast, and has templates for printing single or multiple shots on a page, or different shots on a single sheet at a variety of different sizes to save paper. If you get the Kodak card reader the software with that is very good also, enabling you to do a bit more-you can even touch up those laugh lines (look ten years younger!) along with more detailed editing, and it offers templates for editing and printing as necessary.  I have Photoshop, and although it is useful, it can be time consuming and somewhat mind-boggling.  The software provided with the camera is good; the one with the cardreader gives you a little more to work with, and both are fast and easy to use. An important feature for me is the wide-angle lens (29mm-48mm Zoom) for landscape photography.  It is THE widest lens I have found (except for the Kodak 4800 digital-28mm) for a camera of this type and price-range.  Also, you can control exposure + or -2 stops in half step increments. It has a self-timer & video in/out to view on tv.  It is easy to program, installed easy on my computer.  You can store what seems like a zillion photos at the best & highest setting on a CD rom.  I also got 2 sets of NiMh rechargeable batteries and rechargers-always keep my extra set in my camera case.  I bought 2 extra 16mb picture cards; I can get over 50 pictures on one card at the best settings.To wrap this up, if you want to explore digital, (I've had my Canon F-1 for 23 years) but are skeptical because you are used to high-end 35mm SLR or larger format, this camera is a great one to start with.  Do not let the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed ranges fool you or stop you.  You can even take great night pictures-a favorite of mine-get the tripod-with a little available light. If you are an artist who wants a camera for reference material, look no further-this is the one. It is amazing what this little camera can do!

It was my first digital anything (I still proudly carried my analog cam corder, kept my contacts in a paper address book, etc.), so I was very excited (being the technology buff that I am).  While boxy and a little on the heavy size, the camera really doesn't look bad at all.  Its nicely built as its survived a few perilous falls, however one of the rubber flaps has fallen off over a few years of use.The camera takes nice pictures for what you're paying for, however the zoom leaves much to be desired-expect to be huddled real close to your subject as you snap away.Another downside to this camera is its use of the serial port to transfer pictures.  This is extremely slow and takes a few minutes to even list the pictures on the camera (and if you've got more than 20 or so to transfer, go grab a cup of coffee).  There's no other options for transferring, so you're stuck in that aspect.  Don't buy this camera if you need to take a lot of pictures in a short amount of time... I'd say it takes at least fifteen seconds to store the picture after you snap it.A nice feature of the camera is its ability to be hooked up directly to a TV or VCR.  You can even have it run through the pictures as a slideshow.  The review feature and preferences menu on the camera is very nicely layed out, and you can easily view and delete pictures as you please.Overall this camera definetly gives you your money's worth.. however, if you're looking to take more than vacation and family pictures to stash away in your [on-line] album, I'd strongly suggest looking at other cameras.  While its good for beginners and the casual user, the Kodac DC215 Zoom leaves much to be desired.","Date":"November 30, 2003"}

I especially like the color display on the back of the camera that shows the EXACT composition of the picture that you are going to get. The close-up capability (8 inches away from the subject) is important to me, too.You need to have realistic expectations about the electric power consumed and the limitations of the serial interface as well. It can use up four good batteries in an afternoon if you keep doing things with it that take a lot of power, and the images take a few seconds to transfer to your computer.

To conserve batteries I had to turn off the LCD feature, making that nearly useless too* The close-up feature is totally useless because of how much juice it drains (unless you have an AC adapter)* to save as jpeg in Adobe PhotoDeluxe requires 7 clicks of the mouse and 30 seconds of time (multiply that hundreds of times and you get a frustrated user)* sometimes the camera acts like it has a mind of its own, turning on and off whenever it wants (but this is rare)* the camera programmers decided that the date/time has to be re-entered whenever the camera loses it, this can be really frustrating if you're trying to avoid using the LCD screen to save batteries* the lens cap wore out after a year and it no longer fits the lens, making it useless* the battery holder is still intact, but just barely","Date":"July 24, 2003"}

In fact, except for the occaisional disposable, we don't own, and probably won't own, another camera until we replace this with another digital.This is definitely for the \"Instamatic\" crowd.  Point and shoot, fixed focus, etc.  Everything is made really simple, without getting too technical.I love being able to put them up on the web quickly, and email to friends quickly.Negatives: (Hey, everyone want's to know what I don't like first.) 1.  Delay after taking the picture.  This is the only real complaint I have.  It doesn't seem like it would be that bad, but if you want to take several shots of something in a row, you have to wait.  Kinda kills the moment. 2.  Batteries.  This was a complaint until I started buying NiMH batteries.  DON'T try it with NiCads -- just doesn't work.  And you might want to have some \"emergency\" Lithiums around too (though they are so expensive, I don't do that normally). 3.  I went for the gold, so I got an 8MB card, and it was too small.  So, I just bought a 16 MB card.  I rarely get it full, and if I do, I dig out the 8MB for the rest.  Or, I just get rid of the lousy pictures.  4.  Software -- since I never plug my camera in directly, I was dismayed that the software keeps complaining that I didn't plug in the camera.  So, I just copy all pics onto the hard disk and look at them with the default Microsoft picture viewer.  If need be, I clean them up with PhotoDraw 2000 (which is a total pain -- don't think you're getting anything if you get it).  We get by.

The company I worked for bought a C-3030 and I was called over to set it up.  As I worked with it, I became more and more impressed.  The USB connection is blazingly fast (assuming you're using Win95/98/2000), the LCD is sharp and bright, and the processing of the pictures themselves is very fast.  Then I actually looked at a picture taken at 2048x1536 and my jaw dropped.  Using just the defaults for white balance, ISO, shutter, etc., the picture it took of a hedge of flowers was amazing.  Both the C-3030 and C-3000 have outstanding picture quality due to the well-designed Olympus optics and let you manually set just about everything for that perfect picture. I searched around and bought a C-3000 because the greater onboard memory buffer of the C-3030 wasn't all that important to me, I didn't need Photoshop LE, and I was going to buy a 64 MB card for it anyway.  The $200 you save, in my opinion, makes this a much better buy than the C-3030. One photography magazine labeled the C-3030 \"the camera for nerds\" due to all the options you can set.  If you're into it, this camera will let you explore photography as an art form.  I'm still learning what I can do with it, but it's already produced some beautiful photos. One recommendation I have is to buy a CD burner.  Photo albums on CD save a mess of hard drive space and are a great way to permanently store pictures and then show them off to friends. Finally, there is one feature that I don't see mentioned much elsewhere.  In the panorama mode, if you take pictures in a complete 360, the Camedia software lets you create Quicktime VR movies out of them.  This lets you truly express the feeling of being at a place.  I did one at Lambeau Field and you do feel like you're in the crowd when viewing it.","Date":"October 8, 2000"}

This camera is absolutely incredible.* Be sure you have  a USB port in your computer before getting this, as this is the only way to  connect this camera to your computer---which is much much faster than a  serial port connection.* The software comes with Quicktime so that any  \"movies\" you take with your camera can be .mov files---they come  out great, awesome sound.* There's a 3x zoom which works great...plus  2.5x digital zoom which zooms much further but might sacrifice a little bit  of quality--great to know that one has this option* pretty compact and  looks like a normal camera instead of other bigger, hunkier digital camera  models.* shutter speeds from 16 sec. to 1/800 sec.* 1.8\" wide  LCD monitor in the back for auto viewing* remote controlOverall, this  is a really great camera if you're willing to spend the money.

{"Title":"Terrific camera!  Perfect for the advanced amateur","Author":"P. Hoegel \"average joe\"","ReviewID":"R2PNPRT56ZTWAJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the process of researching digital cameras, when I very unexpectedly got this one for Christmas.  I haven't been disappointed--it is a terrific camera!The controls are wonderfully logical, and are not plagued by cryptic ideographs.  The range of creative control will impress anyone with even a modest background in photography.  The C-3000 lets you go from no-brainer point-and-shoot mode to complete exposure, metering, focus and flash control and back to dummy mode in seconds.  Even better, you can customize the default settings, letting you have the exact baseline settings you want immediately following power on.But the real gems are the Olympus optics and CCD.  I have made dozens of absolutely gorgeous 8x10 and even a few 11x14 prints that are nearly indistinguishable from high quality 35mm prints. Why only four stars?  Because my only serious gripe is the batteries, specifically if you're forced to use anything other than lithums.  I've tried both nickel metal hydride rechargeable and standard alkalines, and it drains them both very quickly.  However, you will conserve a lot of power if you make your default flash setting \"off\", so that you're not charging the flash every time you power on.  Additionally, the Olympus lithium battery packs are very hard to find, but I've found that Energizer AA photo lithiums work just as well, and are often cheaper.As someone with a serious amateur interest in photography for nearly 20 years, I realized recently that the C-3000 has become my primary camera for everything from quick party snaps to that once-in-a-lifetime shot of sunrise on Mt. Fuji.  Meanwhile, both my 35mm P&S; and my Nikon SLR rig are collecting dust.  This camera is an excellent value:  beautiful pictures, easy to use, excellent creative control, and very rugged aluminum construction, a big plus over other manufacturers like Sony.Bottom line:  this is a great camera, and the C-3000 is the best value in the C-30X0 product line.  The only camera I'd recommend instead is the C-4040, which gets you the 4 megapixel CCD, but if you rarely make prints bigger than 8x10.","Date":"August 15, 2001"}

It is a great piece of gem as an upgrade replacement to my older point-and-shoot digital camera that I bought years ago and now I always carry it around with my SLR. Many good things about this camera have been said here and so I try to be concise.For less than $..., you get:1. Great optics and resolution: 8 elements in 6 groups, aspherical lens equivalent to 32-96mm zoom lens on 35mm camera, f2.8-11; 3.3 megapixel CCD producing image resolution up to 2048 x 1536 (Olympus always has excellent optics and image reproduction)2. 1.8\" LCD display and optical viewfinder3. Macro mode for close-up shooting, minimum range: 0.8\"4. Supports Panoramic feature (w/ Olympus SmartMedia only)5. Supports full program, aperature priority and shutter priority auto exposure as well as manual exposure; auto exposure bracketing; spot metering; exposure compensation6. Allows manual focusing7. Able to capture QuickTime movie (15fps) with sound8. IR remote control9. aluminum casting!A few features that I wish it had:1. a faster lens ... like f2.0 in the C-2040 or the f1.8 in C-30402. a larger memory buffer to allow a faster shooting sequence and a longer movie capture time3. a bigger memory card! the 8MB card that it comes with is nowhere near sufficient!4. a more standard lens diameter ... the 43mm threaded lens mount (w/ the CLA-1 adapter) is such an odd size! and you can't put a filter right on the CLA-1 adapter because the lens tube will hit the filter when the camera is powered up!5. a better design: the extended lens with a step-up ring and filter will obstruct the object from the viewfinder!","Date":"October 5, 2001"}
{"Title":"You can't get a better bargain right now.","Author":"L. Wallach","ReviewID":"R3N7TJS90VD6RQ","Overall":"good","Content":"After having a great time with a cheaper digital camera - a Sony DSC-S30 1.3 Megapixel - I decided to trade up to one of the 3+ megapixel cameras.  I did extensive research comparing the top cameras, read countless reviews on photo websites, consumer reviews, etc.  The other cameras that I was seriously considering was the coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70.  I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a bargain.  If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography, the C3000 has almost as much as the 990.  It has manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual focus, and exposure bracketing to name a few.  But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well.  You get a rapid fire mode, which, though not blazingly fast, is still respectable and even increases quite a bit with focus set to manual.  Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio clip, kind of an audio labeling.  There other cameras out there, notably the Cannon Powershot G1, which has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable for taking candid shots.  But the G1 has image problems(Chromatic Aberations and noise), as does the 990(redeye).  All these cameras have plusses and minuses, but with one of the top-rated images and top-rated feature-set with a price that's a couple hundred lower than most of the top cameras, the C3000 really stands out!","Date":"December 14, 2000"}
{"Title":"What are you waiting for?","Author":"\"smackdown221\"","ReviewID":"R3HLKV6LA2Z9P2","Overall":"good","Content":"I had a very hard time deciding on just what digital camera I was going to buy.  Should I get a 2.x megapixel cam  or should I spend a few extra bucks to get the C-3000 zoom, which happens to be the lowest priced 3.3 with the features that this camera has.  Well, obviously I chose the C-3000 and I could not have made a better decision.  All of the features and extras are just the beginning of this cameras greatness.  I was absolutely stunned by the incredible quality of the pictures that this camera produces.  With a good printer and some photo paper, you won't even notice the difference between homemade pictures and professionally developed film pictures.  Even large 8 X 10 pictures are crystal clear with this cam.  When you first use this cam, you may be confused by the many options you have, but after a day or two of playing around and reading the instruction book, you will be able to make the most out of every photo.  If you are one of those people who absolutely hate auto focus, don't worry.  It has it.  It also allows you to control aperture and shutter speed, allowing you to leave the shutter open for a full 16 seconds, allowing you to create amazing effects.  By the second night I had the cam, I produced a neat looking picture of a car with the appearance of the lights tailing behind it thanks to the control you have of shutter speed and flashing.  If you just want simplicity, the C-3000 can do that too.  If you are not into being in control of your photos, just point and click.  If you do not like your photo, you can immediately view and delete it to avoid wasted space.  I can't even estimate how much film I have lost because of bad pictures that I wish I could take back.  If scenery is your thing, then you will love the panoramic feature.  With the aid of a tripod, you can make full 360 degree panoramics.  You take each part of the panoramic individually with the aid of the veiwfinder, and the computer software will combine the pictures allowing you to create a true panoramic, not the fake kind found in Advanced Photo System cameras.  If taking a panoramic seems to complicated for you, then just switch it over to movie mode.  Depending on the memory you have, you can record anywhere from 30 second to 10 minute video clips, all with sound.  If I were to continue listing all of the features, my hands would fall off from typing too much.  Whether you are an avid photographer looking for complete control of every shot or a person looking for a simple digital cam that takes great pictures, this cam is perfect for you.  There is one question about this camera that I do not feel that I could answer.  What can't the C-3000 do???","Date":"February 10, 2001"}

Also you can't put a filter directly on the lens to protect it.  This is the most expensive camera I've ever bought and the only one I can't protect with a filter.There is an answer:  Olympus makes a kit that contains a lens cap retainer and filter + adapter.  It also contains a number of other things I had already bought (very good rechargeable batteries, a case, AC adapter).  It costs $200.

You need to get at least 32 meg of memory if you can't have a computer around all the time. Important note:  the panarama feature is really great but only works with olympus memory. Go  figure. It takes great ambient light photos and the flash is easy to  control, allowing you to moderate the amount of flash. The only drawback I  can think of is it cannot focus much closer than eight inches. The Nikon  990 has it beat there. The takes pictures faster than most cameras that I  tried and boots up pretty quickly.The lens cap knocks off easily so get  one of those lens cap tethers. This camera is super easy and takes an  outstanding picture in the default mode but do yourself a favor and read  the manual. This is one powerful pup. Also rechargable LiMH batteries are a  must. You can fill a 32 meg card easily on one charge. If the price of the  3030 had been as low as it is now I would have sprung for the difference.  Hey, don't waste you time with low res cameras.

In its league it is by far the best digital camera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera's with the same resolution cost a lot more. This camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was disappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better than a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature. It has pretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you might find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as AMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money. This camera comes with the cables that let you connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a carrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are taking (which is a good thing !). You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer (make sure you've got a USB port in your pc and you've got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not work for you.It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay. I recommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a lot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You'll run out of this easily. There are other cameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply wonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger, the batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.","Date":"June 10, 2001"}

I also invested in a larger (64 MB) memory card and a PCMCIA card reader adapter so I could download to my PC.  Great picture quality!  Unbelievable depth of field.  Movie feature is cute, but obviously no substitute for a video camera.I would have given this 5 stars but for a few small, nagging things that were troublesome during running around the UK:-  the stock memory card (8 MB) is stupidly small.  16MB is the absolute minimum that should be offered.  My new 64 MB card held 80 pictures at the HQ setting, and these pictures turned out very nice.-  though the camera is small when looking at it from the front, it is pudgy in the thickness direction.  This makes taking it out of your pocket and/or the carry case difficult and frustrating.-  as with others, I found the lens cap to be plain dumb.  A little plastic, clip-on thing that gets knocked off really easily when removing the camera from the case, and gets lost in your pocket between pictures.  Some sort of a built-in cap would be SO much nicer.-  if you forget to take the cap off before you turn it on, even to download pictures, the telescoping lens gets trapped and probably grinds and slips gears.  I did this a couple of times, and I hope I didn't damage the mechanism-  the LCD on the back of the camera is nice, but gets scratched when the camera swings back and forth when you have it slung around your neck.  The plastic covering the LCD is so soft that the plastic buttons on my shirt left little scratches!Don't get me wrong, I love this camera and would buy it again.

If you use the C3000 for prints, you will need a minimum of a 64 to a 128 mg card because of the needed space. The camera now comes with a nice \"Olympus\" lens cap.

It takes great pictures and is very easy to use -  even the menus which you will get familiar with upon regular use. Get an extra Smartmedia card because they only give you an 8mb card with the camera. Also, get a battery recharger (Rayovac's 1-hour recharger works great with their 1600NiMH batteries and for me, they have charged in less than an hour!). The reason I gave this great camera four-stars is because of the lens cap. If you forget to remove the lens-cap when you turn the camera on, you will hear an ugly noise that reminds you to take it off and you HAVE TO remove the lens cap. Also, the lens cap is not attached to the camera itself upon removal so you run the risk of losing it (I have misplaced mine about three times now. Luckily I have found it each time!). Aside from the lens cap issue, I think this is a fantastic camera to welcome an individual to the \"filmless\"  world.

Dont know why ?? - For very close shots, what u see in the view finder is not what you get in the picture - so might have to use the lcd screen to preview. - Add extra cost for rechargable cells. The ones that come with it will not last very long (about 150 shots). - Extra cost for camera cover - which is a must - because this puppy seems fragile.","Date":"May 25, 2001"}

On the outside of the box and in the advertising it says the camera is compatible with Windows 95/98/2000.  When you look inside the owners manual it says that it is not compatible with Windows 95, nor Windows 95 that has been upgraded to Windows 98. It must be a fully installed 98 or 2000 program, not just an upgrade.  We called the company and this was verified.  We have the correct ports on our computer, just not the correct program.  Now we are deciding if it is worth installing a new computer system just to use a camera!","Date":"January 11, 2001"}

This is it. The Olympus C3000 is simply the best camera with the most features for the price. It remains compact (similar cameras from other manufacturers are bulky in comparison), is loaded with features, and is easy to use. I use this camera for web page images, printable family photos, and for more artistic shots. I even use it to record remarkably high quality Quicktime movies for my web site (with sound!).You will be snapping photos minutes after opening the box, and with a little practice you will master the advanced features of this camera.Be sure to buy a 32 or 64 MB card with it, though. The 8MB card that comes standard is too small for much of anything.And be sure to keep track of the lens cap. For some reason Olympus decided not to tether the thing to the housing.","Date":"December 24, 2000"}

I agree that the lens cap is definately the only drawback to this powerful camera.  I wonder how much damage is done when you leave the cap on when you turn it on.  I am looking forward to purchasing the lens filter and adapter kit that comes with the AC  adapter that \"A Customer from Weston, CT\" referred to, as soon as I find it.  Haven't been able to locate such an accessory package yet. This camera is as close to an SLR in a digital camera that I can afford.  Just to be able to add lens filters, telephoto and wide angle lenses is very rare in this price range of digital cameras.

The pictures taken in daylight are absolutely astonishing, I'm telling you. I think the only thing I regret is that it doesn't have a manual focus, but the autofocus is just so good, I really hardly ever miss it.I took a photography class and used the Canon Digital Rebel as well as the Nikon D70 for shots for the class as well as this camera, and honest to god, every time I used my own camera people would ask \"which camera did you use for that?!\" they were so impressed when I'd tell them it was my own 3.2 megapixel one instead of the hearty 8mp thing.

My first was a Sony (pre-Mavica) first generation. It had 640x480 resolution and left a lot to be desired.  That's where Olympus comes in.I've never gotten better pictures, digitally, since my Nikon 8080 35mm camera.  Regardless of the lighting conditions, I seem to take perfect pictures, through no fault of my own.  I put the setting at P for automatic and the pictures at 3.3 megapixel quality make perfect printed photos; even at 8x10 size.  I would highly recommend this great product to anyone who wants the ability to use fully automatic or programmable modes.  It even records QuickTime movies, although that's probably the only drawback to me as I've not been successful in creating any good ones.

This is especially useful if you are a novice such as myself and need to liberally crop to have a nice picture (you won't end up with a grainy mess).-It's small and easy to hold.-It has quicktime video (which I didn't think I would use, but certainly has come in handy).-It is fairly quick to recover between shots.-It takes AA rechargeable batteries, and standard memory cards- both easy to get and not overly expensive.-It has a nifty remote control.-The Camedia software is very easy to use, and I have had no problem at all uploading pictures from the camera using the usb cable included.Some things that I don't like:-It makes a horrible grinding noise if you turn it on w/o taking the lens cover off!-It is unwieldy to page through menus to control aperture/focal length settings.  Dial control of this (like on regular cameras) would be a huge bonus.-If you buy the adapter lens kit, you must remove it everytime you shut your camera off (because the fitting is on the retractable lens)  Not very convenient at all.Overall, I have been extremely happy with this camera, especially for the price.","Date":"December 12, 2001"}

It will work just fine if you upgraded to 98 SE.  I would recommend a higher capacity memory card; the 8MB is not really useable for much.  The lens cap, as many other users have reported, is a pain.  The best thing about the whole unit is that it is so user friendly.  I am truly an amateur photgrapher, and in no time, I was taking great pictures.  The menus are easy to understand, and you can quickly make adjustments.

When set to 'point and shoot', the camera makes me look like I know what I'm doing.  The picture quality is excellent.  I'm  also starting to get into the advanced features, and the manual settings allow a great deal of flexibility.  On another note, I did have to send the camera in for repair (the problem may have even been my fault).  I was going on a trip in a couple of weeks, and desperately wanted the camera for it, but I didn't think there was any way they could get it back to me.  Well, I'm happy to say they got it back to me in less than 2 weeks, in time for my trip.

{"Title":"Still going strong","Author":"Steve Pickering \"Steve\"","ReviewID":"R3FE9BI98O7O94","Overall":"good","Content":"Having been a veteran of the SLR scene, I waited a long time to buy a digital camera. I have now had my C-3000 for 3 years and it is still performing excellently. Only 3.3 megapxels? No problem. Unless you are printing poster sized pictures, who needs more? (unless you really want to get SLR quality, which I believe is now possible). True, this was expensive when I bought it (equivalent of $1,000), but the number of photos I have taken has saved me this in processing fees. It is easy to use and if you are daring enough has enough interesting advanced features. Once I figured out how to depress the button slightly for autofocusing etc, I could do panning shots.The downside: Yes, the lens cap does tend to get lost, but my brother has a later version with string attached. The LCD panel gets scratched, but I have not noticed diminished monitor quality. Olympus tell you not to use it outside in cold weather because of condensation problems. Does this not apply to all electronics, or is it a problem with this camera?I am shortly going to purchase a 128mb card, as they are now cheap. I can't find any limitations on card size, so I hope it is OK. The CAMEDIA software is OK, but the USB connection is a little sensitive. PICASA does not pick up this camera at all-it senses otyher digitals.Overall, I think in its class this is a classic, just like the Olympus OM-1/10 was a classic SLR. If you can pick one up second-hand, do so. Just check that LCD screen.","Date":"October 1, 2004"}

With the 3x optical zoom and the 2.5x digital zoom (which there are plenty of mega-pixels to support) You have a combined 5.5 zoom capability, more than eneough for the average person. If you use a good photo-quality printer, such as the hp photo series you will be extremely well pleased with quality of your pictures.  Does have the drawback of only coming with a 8mb smartmedia card, but the prices of memory cards are dropping weekly, and you should be able to get a 128mb card for as low as 89.99.

I even bought a different model but exchanged it for the C3000 due to the overwhelming reviews and first hand experience.  My first camera was a Canon AE1 so it was important to have flexibility with aperature settings, lighting, focus, etc.  The colors of my photos are vibrant and warm.  I've even shot some unbelievable b/w photos, which I printed and framed (8x10).  Friends can't believe that they were taken by a digital camera.  The only downside to this and many of the digital cameras is the shooting range is short.  SLR photographers...don't expect to get those great close-ups with this camera unless your subject is right there.  And the shutter speed is slow so you won't be taking many action shots with this camera.I use a 128 mb card and can shoot 70 shots per card with the SHQ setting.  Once the card is full, I transfer the shots to a CD, reformat the card and I'm ready to shoot again.

Dave a Pro Photographer","Author":"David Cruikshank","ReviewID":"R2Y0LUO3USD1V5","Overall":"good","Content":"I searched all over the Web, and in stores before I bought my Olympus C3000Z.  I can tell you from experience you can look everywhere, but for a great price from a reliable source, just stop here and buy from Amazon. I am a professional photographer who wanted a digital camera for last minute headshots, web use, and to become more knowledgeable about digital photography.  I knew that Olympus made excellent digital cameras, so I narrowed my search on their brand.  I also knew I wanted 3.3 Megapixles.I have hade mine for a about a month now, and I'm very pleased. Through a combination of an Olympus accesory cable ( the FLCB04 ) and some wiring of my own ( I'm a techie at heart ) I have used my C3000 with my studio strobes, and also a Nikon SB series flash, with excellent results.  I love the instant feedback, and not worrying about how much film I'm using.  I know I have only scratched the surface of this cameras capabilities.  I do suggest if you buy one that you buy the biggest Smartmedia card you can afford,  I plan on getting a 128MB, and that you also buy 2 sets of NIMH batteries and a charger.  This camera like all digital cameras will just chew through normal alkeline cells if you use the LCD display for any length of time.  When I went to the Photo East Show in NYC this past November, the Olympus rep told me that this camera would not Sync with Studio flash.  Well I can tell you Yes it does.  I will warn you, you need to use a flash with a low sync voltage or use a Radio slave to protect the sync circuits in the camera, but it does work.  For me it has been like discovering Photography all over again.  You can do things you just can't do with a normal film camera such as change the speed ( ISO ) for each frame if you want to.  Switch on the fly from color, to Sepia, to B&W;, and best of all, see right then and there if you got the shot you were after.  My only complaints are 1) the shutter lag that is part of all sub $2000 digital cameras, and the time it take to write the file to the card if you shoot in Hi-Res TIFF format.  But this is a (...) camera, next year I'll go for the E20.  In closing for the amount of money I spent, I have no regrets.","Date":"November 28, 2001"}

I have been using this camera for two years and counting without a problem. I think the picture quality is excellent and this camera is very durable.

The screen is not to small, yet not so large to suck up your batteries if you use it as the view finder. Lots of modes to change your resolutions and quite easy to do.

I've used film cameras, 35mm 2.5x2.5, and point and shoot for years and so far after about month this camera is an excellent choice.  I've used the Nikon 990 (about $(dollar amount)at work and the Olympus lens and picture quality seems to be, so far comparable.Downloading with the USB cable and Olympus software is a breeze, but don't expect to do much manipulation of the image with this software.  I use Picture IT! software and presently looking at other inexpensive, usable software for an amateur like me.I took note of the problems with the lens cap, dropped mine several times and forgot to remove when turning on the camera, but I visited my local (...) and purchased a \"tether\" for less than $(dollar amount) that sticks on the cap and connects to the strap or strap attachment. It has become a habit to automatically take off the cap after removing from the camera bag and before turning on the camera.A family picture taken with the camera will be printed with a HP 952C Deskjet on Christmas card paper that will be sent to family and friends.A great bargin. If support and durability are as good as the camera seems to be I will be carrying the C3000Z instead of film cameras.","Date":"December 3, 2001"}

With a resolution of 3.2mp, this camera takes pictures that are still good for web pages and most advertising flyers and prints we produce.It might seem odd to be writing a review for a camera this old, but we are about to retire this one from the shop (replacing it with Fujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Triple Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD) and give it to one of my kids as a beater camera. I noticed that several of these cameras were being sold on Amazon as used (but not by me), and wanted to let people know that it is possible for there to be \"life\" in a camera this old.Here are my general observations (+/-):+ Good Lens - 3x Optical Zoom- Shows \"Purple Fringing\" in some cases+ Good Solid Body - Feels good in the hand- Bad Lens Cap - Replaced mine with a 3rd party one that is no longer made+ Good Movie Mode w/Sound - A nice feature when this camera was made- Uses SmartMedia Cards - Fairly low capacity, getting harder to find, and many computers require usb adapters to read them+ Great Macro Mode - Very good for our product pictures+ Remote Control - Suports a remote control, which is important for tripod shots in low lightWe have taken 1000s of pictures with this camera, including two award winning photos, and it likely will take many more.Highly recommended!","Date":"September 18, 2009"}

The C3000 was the natural choice of camera for me, mainly because of the full manual facility that it offers as well as a 9Mb TIFF option.My only gripe about the camera is that the external flash socket has been changed from the standard two pin pc connector to the dedicated 5 pin type for the Olympus dedicated flashgun ( not even the same fitting as the older T32 type) The C2020 works very well using studio flash equipment and is ideal for checking out lighting st ups for large format photography. No chance with the 3000 however.....anyway I guess that's a small price to pay, and the majority of users wouldn't want to use external flash.One point about the software, every time the panarama option was chosen on the computer, it bombed out. Full marks to Olympus, 12 hours after e-mailing them with the symptom, they sent a patch to fix the problem.To round off, a great (not so little) camera for the money, there are smaller lighter ones on the market that fit in the pocket easier, but nothing to match the options offered by the C3000....Just hope I feel the same way about it in six months!","Date":"January 11, 2002"}

Went w/the 3000zoom because [another store] had it for 10% off their everyday price ... and the PNY Smart Media 128meg cards were on sale for TWO for ...! They also threw in a PNY USB Smart Media reader for FREE! How could I refuse?On to the camera - I took about 50 pictures at the second-highest resolution (SHQ) and they were higher resolution than my laptop video card & monitor could handle because they looked oversaturated and had a cross-hatch pattern. Took out the SM card, plugged it into my USB reader, downloaded them to my desktop PC & manipulated the images w/MGI Photosuite 3. This program can resize the images, enhance the image w/a one-button click and do just about anything you want with the pictures.Love the images, but still NO 35mm comparison yet. My complaints about the camera regard the setups. Kinda time-consuming to bracket the shot and set it up properly. No where near a logical set-up. Guess I'll have the cliff-divers in Acapulco wait in mid-air while I set this ... up. Would be much more beneficial to have pre-programmed buttons to save time. Pretty funky that the extension tube sticks out for EVERYTHING, including picture review. No rechargeable batteries - How come? Even my bottom-of-the-barrel Mavica came w/a charger and NiMH. Smart Media is cheap, that's good. I'll use the 8meg included card as a back-up to my 256 megs of storage.

This is my first digital camera (not a bad way to start).  The picture quality is great, now I will have to upgrade my printer to get the most out of my images.  The panoramic mode is awesome.  Just shoot the picuters and let the software mend them together.  Also the RCA jack to hook up to a TV is also very handy to display your pictures to your friends.  The menu drivin modes is very easy to use, however don't leave home without the instruction manual, you will probaly need it to get the most out of the feature and relying on your memory may not cut it.  The downsides are minimal.  The lens cap thing that others have written about is true, hang on to that thing.  It has a little trouble working in a cold environment.  Get a battery charger!  The 8mb card is not enough, I would recommend a 32mb.  Plan on spending a couple hundred more in accesories. Overall I love the idea of saying goodbye to film and developing time and costs.

{"Title":"The best camera","Author":"Pablo","ReviewID":"R10AP22JIM9NCE","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my first digital camera about five years ago, and I pay $400 for it, and it was good by that time but not better than a 35mm film camera, the resolution was pretty bad, the size of the pictures too small and just 1Mb of internal memory. I decided to buy a new one so I checked a lot of  reviews about this camera. That you can see  at . . . and  other reviews of different cameras and my conclusion is that the Nikon  Coolpix 990 is the one that takes the most beautiful pictures, has the best  and amazing macro ability and excellent manual white balance. But the flash  is the worst of all the digital cameras of this quality I have seen, has no  audio ability and no remote control. The picture quality of the Nikon  coolpix 990 is just very but very slight better than the olympus 3000, the  white balance of the olympus 3000 can not be set up manually but is  incredibly accurate, the macro mode is fair and good and my olympus 3000  has a very good flash with red eye control, audio ability, one of the best  things the remote control and of course the price that is lower than  the nikon not including the price of the bulky external flash that would be  needed that is more. So for me this was the best buy and if you  compare it with the olympus 3030 is also better because the only difference  is the software included that I already have, 16MB smartmedia card I  already have a 64MB one of my MP3 player and a feature that nobody uses  much the 32MB of internal memory buffer that let you take longer mov  movies.The pictures that I have taken with this camera are amazing a lot  better than a 35 mm camera, the detail is incredible and if you have a very  good printer you would enjoy the best pictures ever, It is so easy to use  that everybody can be a professional, you can see the results immediately  and if you do not like what you see just erase the picture, change the  settings and take another picture.

I was going to buy the model  under it that only records 640 x 480 but I am glad I didn't now.  The  difference in recording at 1.3 megapix versus 640x480 is very noticable.  If you just want a basic camera, go for the lesser model but if you are  already spending that much, go ahead and chunck down the extra 200 bucks,  it is very well worth it.  This camera is very easy to use.  I love the  fact that you can record on floppies.  NO need to install software or  cabels.  I use this camera at work which is why I got the floppy drive on a  digital camera.  People need pics taken of different things, you take them,  just hand them the disk when you are finished, no need to run to a computer  to download then transfer to disk.  The drive writes really quickly on this  camera, so hardly no waiting at all.  Also love the fact of it having a  rechargeable battery.  It uses the same battery as my sony handcam so I  actually have two batteries and they use the same charger, so that was an  added bonus.  The battery charges in about 20 minutes to full capacity and  lasts about 60 pictures before needing charging.  I did have a minolta  digital camera without the floppy and the recharagable batteries and I tell  you, it was eating those AA batteries up fast.

That's so cool!\"  And they want to know all about it, how much it cost, etc.The only flaw I've found: I do find that when I put the camera on the highest quality settings, I can only get about 6 pictures per floppy disk (yesterday's technology) which is somewhat annoying.  At some point, I will probably invest in the Smart/Memory Stick (tomorrow technology) and an adaptor which will allow me to take tons of pictures at one setting.I really love this camera... a great investment!","Date":"October 16, 2000"}

I had heard from at least two other individuals whoregularly run auctions, that this little camera does beautifulcloseups.

With the floppy disk access you're loosing somewhat on storage capacity (or the need to carry several floppies with you), but then, just pop it in and  done.  The viewer is high quality \"real-time\" LCD display, unlike  some that are jittery, or feel like slow-motion movie.The ability to  take MPEG clips is very attractive.

I imagine that digital cameras will be the big hit  this Christmas season, so, wait for these products to go down in price a  little before buying such a major purchase.  If you check out my previous  reviews I made a review about the Panasonic portable DVD player and the  price of that item in October 1999 was $1100.00, I think it's probably  under that figure now.  The utmost thing to do with products like this is  COMPARE PRICES!  Check out other online stores as well as Amazon and check  out other electronics stores to get the best deal possible.

{"Title":"Great camera !","Author":"Robin Coleman","ReviewID":"R3UX3OP4NNI045","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Sony Mavica FD85 as a Christmas gift to myself.  So far I couldn't be happier.  After much reading about digital camera's I knew I wanted this camera.  It seemed to me that using a floppy was much easier than having to hook up cables.  And it's a breeze to view the pictures I've taken !  The FD85 has an easy to understand menu that pops up on the LCD screen.  The mini movie feature is fun to play around with too.  Some folks talk about it's bulky size because of using a floppy disk to store the images, but it's no bigger than my Pentax K1000 35mm camera and lighter in weight.  And I don't have to drop everything to change to my zoom lens as with my Pentax.  One thing I didn't care for is the ArcSoft PhotoStudio software included with the camera.  It's cheap and very hard to adjust your pictures.  I never did get a decent photo printed out using that software.  So, I started using my Adobe PhotoDeluxe and it works great !  The pictures I've printed out have been of good quality and suitiable  for framing.  The only reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star rating was because I've only had it a week.  I will post another review after I've used it for several months.  In a nutshell, this was a great gift to myself and well worth the money.","Date":"December 28, 2000"}

Ikelite even makes an underwater housing for this camera, but it costs more than the camera does.

I was going to get the Mavica FD-71 (i believe thats the model #)...the order was all filled out then i clicked cancel bec. i wasn't sure...so i went with the better model...FD-85.  My friend has the FD-71 and i always thought it was a good camera.  Now that i have this one...i can see a HUGE DIFFERENCE in quality.  For the money it costs...GO FOR IT...you will not regret it one bit.  Take my review into great consideration...i will tell you the positives...for starters the quality is great..don't listen to any negatives about the quality because you will not be disapointed.  Next, the fact that it copys to a disk is amazing.  You can take all the pictures you want!  You can also copy the disk right there on the camera and give it to a friend.  Another amazing feature is that you can make short 15 second movies.  This is a great feauture to play around with.  It also has a audio/video out jack which allows you to use the camera to record a movie onto a VCR.  The best thing about this whole camera is the ease of use.  To be honest and straight out...an idiot can use this camera.  The menu set up and the options within the camera can be operated by a young child.  There are no cables to use and no software to load...just insert a disk and enjoy.  Sony has done it again.  All of my electronics are sony...TV, DVD, VCR, Receiver, and now camera...they are just the kings of electronics....you can't go wrong with anything they make.  Just trust me...buy this camera..spend the extra money.  Anyone who is involved with ebay should buy this for easy posting of auctions.  My #1 use is for ebay and i will make the money back in profits from ebay for the camera.","Date":"December 21, 2000"}

Have shot a thousand or more images without any problems.  I am a claims adjuster and use the camera mainly for work.  I basically compose the shot, point and shoot.  The only shortcomings that do not warrant the five star are:  the viewfinder is impossible to see with strong light striking it.  Also the flash needs help in very low light situations - like dark smoke residue rooms.  The battery that comes with the unit should be supplemented by purchasing an extra longer life battery to keep as a spare.  Great camera.

{"Title":"A very good value","Author":"Timothy E. Parker","ReviewID":"R2ML6TNCMDQXEE","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera based on some previous experience with the Mavica FD-73 digital camera...which has lower specs, but its operation is almost identical.  I didn't want to put out too much money on this camera, yet I didn't want to chintz on the technical aspect.  Another reason I bought this camera is because Sony is one of the few (if not the only) manufacturer to say in its sales pitch that their camera does MPEGs...and in comparison tables, not all digicams make MPEGs.  As with a lot of new digital devices, there are almost too many bells & whistles built-in, to the point it's overwhelming.  However, with a little practice, and time spent reading the owner's manual (yes, be a nerd, and READ IT), it's quite easy to operate.  The sepia effects that are available are fantastic.  There are still a lot of features on this camera I need to explore.  One thing I have noticed on the MPEGs, is that if you double-click the filename, once you have the MPEG in/on your PC, it opens in a very small window, and the audio seems to be at double-speed.  However, when viewing with Media Player, it works fine.  Maybe it's just me. OVerall, a good camera at a good price...something in the middle of the road, but it satisfies my needs.","Date":"December 30, 2000"}

I've had my camera for a year now and can honestly say I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a reliable, easy to use, excellent picture quality digital camera. The pop up menus are easy to reconnoiter and adjust, but do take the time to learn the features before you venture out on a picture taking trip. Depending upon the resolution, I got 10-20 pictures on a 3.5 floppy. I am now looking at purchasing a memory stick to avoid having to deal with so many floppy disks. The case it comes with is adequate but really only large enough for a few discs and the camera so had to pack to charger unit in another bag. I took the camera on vacation last year to Canada. As long as I charged it up each evening I was set for the next day. If you care to see the picture quality, feel free to visit some of my online pics at: [...]This camera also takes up to 15 second moving pictures.

An easy to read menu bar which is illuminated on the LCD ,makes for easy access to index through pictures, edit, add effects, protect or delete pictures.

At the highest quality setting, 6 pictures can be stored on one 3.5 floppy disk and 30 pictures at the lowest setting. All pictures are stored in JPG format and can be later saved using the \"Monarch\" Photo Lab Application that comes with the camera.

Nor having to install special software to view the pictures when done.

{"Title":"What a great camera, with only minor flaws","Author":"\"adpinc\"","ReviewID":"R18A8VQO3M97HM","Overall":"good","Content":"I saw this camera in a showcase at the Wiz, and was impressed with how small it was compared to the competition.  Given that I have an infant crawling around my house now, I found that I wanted to take instant pictures more and more, rather than taking 35mm and then sending them off for development.  I have a Canon Rebel-G, which I love, but is a bulky SLR and I found that I didn't just carry it around.  A digital camera was exactly what I had been looking for.Now I take this little camera everywhere I go.  For an ameteur, this camera is all you will ever need.  I use the medium quality (1600 x 1200 compressed) and the pictures are outstanding, especially for email and digital processing.  I haven't even tried taking pictures in high resolution (1600 x 1200 uncompressed), the quality is so good.  Friends and family are blown away at the clarity.The limitation on the quality would be the printer, which now I think maybe its time to buy a photo printer with higher resolution.Disadvantages:1) The flash card that comes with the camera is too small.  A second 8MB or one 16MB would be better.  That gives you an equivalent roll of film (20 shots or so on medium resolution).  I need to buy one.2) The battery supplied with the camera does not last long enough, especially with the LCD display enabled.  A second battery is a must, especially if you want to take the camera with you, and you don't want to lug the charger.  Fortunately, the battery is recharged within an hour.3) The camera gets surprisingly warm during extended use (a small nuisance).4) Switching to digital zoom mode feels like it takes too long, and the camera does not stay in digital zoom mode when switching between reviewing pictures and taking pictures.5) Red-eye reduction really doesn't help at all.6) I wish a power adaptor to run the camera was standard.  It needs to be bought seperately.7) A camera case should come with the camera and doesn't.  I highly recommend one be bought with the camera as the elegant stainless steel finish is likely to become scratched when carried about without a case. (I'm a bit fanatical about my electronics when I like them).8) When flipping through pictures previously taken, the camera closes its lens.  Not only is this a waste of battery life, it is annoying to wait for the lens to reopen for new shots.Advantages:1) Small size is fantastic!  You can take it everywhere.2) Powerful flash.  Brightens images even 10 feet away.3) Super-clear image quality.  It feels like you can reach into the picture when you see it on the screen.4) Awesome software.  The camera comes with a USB cable, and when it is plugged in, the computer wakes up and downloads the images.  The software is very easy to use, and highly intuitive.  It makes digital editing a pleasure.  A great feature.5) Viewfinder or LCD display are both available for use, and the LCD can be disabled to save battery life.  Very nice.6) Optical and digital zooms work very well (though a bit slow).  Image centering seems perfect in viewfinder.7) Image processing is quick.  You can snap a picture every two seconds without waiting for the image to process.8) The lens is protected when not in use, and is self-stored.Overall, I am thrilled with this camera, given the misgivings of many others.  Canon is a trusted name in photography, and I highly recommend this unit.","Date":"October 1, 2000"}

After a week of ownership, overall I'm delighted with the product. However, it was poor of Canon not to include a pouch for the camera - no more than a $1 cost to them but essential in protecting the camera from an occasional knock, IMO. Also missing is an AC adapter to power the camera - the included battery charger requires that the battery be removed from the camera, meaning that I can't be charging the battery while transferring images to the pc Note: If you are planning on buying this camera (or any other digital camera), be aware that you will need to buy a high-capacity compact flash card. If you go on a vacation and plan on taking more than 15 pics or so before you get back to your computer, then the stock 8mb card included with the camera won't cut it. I got a 64mb card (About $120) which should do nicely.

{"Title":"A Terrific, Compact easy to use Digital camera","Author":"Colin Ooi","ReviewID":"RBB40ICZRAHHN","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera recently to replace my Sony Mavica digital camera and to use alongside my Canon EOS 300 SLR camera.My initial concerns that the camera would not be compatible with my Pentium III 800 running Windows Millenium Edition were unfounded. I had downloaded the appropriate driver from the canon.com.au website and installed this, rather than the driver was on the Canon CD that came along with the camera. There had been mention only of compatibility with W98 and W2K, so I was relieved to find the WME driver available.Setup was quick and without a hassle. I was able to operate camera, and transfer pictures without having to open the manual at all.This camera is very much an improvement over my previous digital camera. With super fast transfer of pictures by USB, its ultra compact shape and size, retractable lens system, and its 3-point autofocus system, the Canon Ixus has produced numerous images that I will keep.I have found the ZoomBrowser software to be very easy to use, although other reviewers have mentioned their dislike of this particular application. The PC will automatically detect the camera when you switch it on and plug the USB cable in, and will launch the ZoomBrowser for you. You can even transfer pictures from the PC to the camera which comes in handy when you want to bring your CF card to a photo developer to produce prints for selected photos.I bought an extra rechargeable battery to go with it and it turned out to be a good decision. I added a 64 MB Compact flash to the 8 MB one that came with it, as well. The 64 MB card will store 107 1600 X 1200 pictures or over 360 640x480 pictures.Overall this camera gets 5 stars from me. It is a true pocket-sized camera with its light weight portability being a major plus!","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

The size of this camera alone, and the reviews above told me it was time to buy.  You will be impressed with how Canon has squeezed so  much into such a small space.  The camera comes with a quick charger and  one battery pack.  Time to charge about 2 hours.  Setup was so simple that  as a first time digital camera owner, I had little trouble after a quick  scan of the manual setting up for my first shots.  The LCD display is  bright and though small, very easy to see. Controls are well laid out and  simple to understand.  I am so impressed with this camera, because it is so  simple to use and due to it's size, I know I will take it along more often  than my old 35mm monster.  Suggestion, order a larger flash card (the  included 8mb card is almost useless for high resolution photos).  The only  negative, no medium resolution such as 1024x768.  You are stuck with  1600x1200 or 640x480, but this won't be a problem if you have a larger  flash card.  If you're a graphics artist, you will probably want a  3megapixel camera, but for the average user, this small camera will get  used more due to it's size and takes great photos.

{"Title":"Three Quibbles","Author":"Sam Trychin","ReviewID":"RKYBSHY7GQV01","Overall":"good","Content":"I agree that this is an amazing camera for its size, but I wanted to add some caveats:1) The quality of the photos is slightly lower than that of top-of-the-line 2.1 megapixel cameras (e.g., the PowerShot S10).  This is due to the extreme miniturization of the lens and CCD.  Keep in mind that this camera trades some image quality for convenience.2) Only three image resolution/quality combinations: 1600x1200 hi-quality JPEG, 1600x1200 compressed JPEG, and 640x480 compressed JPEG.  I would have liked a mid-range size between 1600x1200 and 640x480 (1280x960?), and the ability to choose image quality settings (hi/low is enough for me) on a per-resolution basis, for a total of six combinations.3) Colors are not quite as bright/saturated as on the Nikon CoolPix 950/990, Olympus 2020z/3030z, or even the Canon PowerShot S10 & S20.These three quibbles are relatively minor, but seemed worth mentioning.Convenience is more important to me than absolute image quality, so I am extremely happy with this camera.  Image quality is still remarkably good, and it is by far the most convenient (and cutest!) digital camera currently available. Sam","Date":"June 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Little camera that could!","Author":"R. Mallory \"Woodworking Rev\"","ReviewID":"RQ9JXY3EQSO6W","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this little baby two weeks after it hit the market here and I have had a little time to put it through its paces.  In fact, it has even been to Israel with a friend and he has the same reaction that I have.  As a travel companion, it is great.  The color saturation is pretty good, though not quite as good as Olympus.  However, remember that you can correct that in software if you know how to use it.  The images are sharp and well balanced.  The optics are exception for a camera inn this class!  Learn to use the white balance settings and your photos will improve.Use the high-res mode (1600x1200), the images are not that large and the image is much better.  At the same time, buy yourself at least a 64meg card, I use a 128meg card and that is good for around 80 shots.  If you need to squeeze more on, the hi-res compressed mode is not bad at all; just remember that the images are not going to be as detailed when enlarged.The battery lasts a lot longer than average.  I suspect that that is partially due to the lighting of the LCD screen coming from a white LED rather than a more conventional source.  It is not uncommon for a battery to last the whole day of shooting.  For me that is about 60-70 Hi-Res pictures.  While there is no disposable option, the spare battery can be had for a reasonanble price (litium-ion batteries are very expensive, trust me when I say Canon's price here is reasonable!)The down sides?  No type II slot for Microdrive or high capacity cards. Thus, you are probably limited to 192meg cards.  The macro is limited.  I'd like to focus down a little more.  The zoom is fine for me, but for nature shooters, it could be limiting.  The preview is awkward and the camera defaults out of the box to low res (640x400) be sure to reset the defaults to the high setting (1600x1200).These are all nits!  Given the size, quality of construction and the images that you can produce with this camera, the down sides are minor and can be ignored by the average snap shot photographer.","Date":"October 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"An ideal APS camera replacement","Author":"K Gill","ReviewID":"R246BPI527BOFY","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for a few days and have put it through it's paces. I bought the Digital Elph to replace an APS camera, and it takes shots that are comparable, if not better than the APS.  Even the 8x10's prints (in fine mode 1600 x 1200) look about the same as with my old APS (in superfine mode, they look even better!).  With a 4 x 6 print size, (in fine mode 1600 x 1200) you will see little difference in quality when compared to an average 35mm camera.The advantages of this camera far outweigh the disadvantages.  Quite simply, it is easy to use, and the battery life is better than most and it recharges fast.  It has a solid feel, a stainless steel case and is really well built.  The LCD is easily viewable in daylight. Fine mode at 1600 x 1200, is perfect for most pictures.  The software that comes with it is first rate, and easy to use. Taking panorama shots, and \"stitching\" them together with the provided software is really simple to do.  Red-eye correction works well (For a camera that has a flash this small and close to the lens) as long as the subjects look right into the camera.  The \"Wow! What is that?\" factor is difficult to describe.  This camera is an attention-getter!Disadvantages?  I can't complain about the small size of things, the buttons are about as good as they can be on something this small.  As with all digital cameras you will have to buy extra memory card(s), I bought a 64MB card that hold plenty of pics.  You will also have to buy an extra battery, which because it is proprietary, cost .... (but is also lithium-Ion, an advantage.)  When going from optical zoom to digital zoom, the transition in the LCD screen is jerky, but who cares about digital zoom anyway (If you need to zoom in more, take your shots in Super Fine mode, and enlarge the picture in software).  This baby can get HOT! when you use it.Other information of interest:  USB connectivity worked fine in Win2k, but it did require a reboot before it would function.  Pics in all but the brightest light outdoors seem to be slightly under exposed, I set the exposure +1/3 f-stop, and it seems to capture colors more accurately.  A video out cable lets you view your photos on your TV.The Powershot ... Digital Elph is the perfect APS camera replacement.","Date":"November 20, 2000"}

I was smitten and bought one immediately. I have taken about 200 pictures in the last 2 weeks and  have not been disappointed.If you want a camera to take everywhere to  record life's events, this is the camera. You can't truly appreciate the  size of this camera until you see it in person. I took it bike riding last  week and hooked it to my belt (using the OEM case). I had to check several  times to make sure it was still there.While serious hobbyists may  complain that image quality is not up to the top digital cameras, 99% of us  will be more than satisfied. Prints up to 8 by 10 are comparable in quality  to film based cameras. Plus I like the fact that with the included software  and my trusty Epson printer, I can correct some of my little boo boos like  red eye problems.One final thing make sure that you leave some money in  your budget for a larger CF card, an extra battery and the OEM case since  you will be taking this camera everywhere and taking more pictures than you  ever thought possible.Great job Canon.","Date":"July 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Easy to use.  Good quality and fun!","Author":"Dave Keiser","ReviewID":"RAV9SBFC51P4P","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.  I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.  In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.  The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).But the BEST thing about this little camera is that it is being used.  It only takes a few seconds to turn on, we take our shot with out having to mess with dials and settings every time and then go on.  Then, when the card is full we download it to our computer for viewing, printing and later storage on a CD.It's so easy, we use it all the time and since there's no film, we don't worry about taking too much.  We'll edit bad shots out when we want.  I'm just glad that we're saving memories really easily, because that's what cameras are for!If you're looking for a nice point and shoot digital camera that does all the 'brain-work' for you and will take great shots, and be fun to use all at the same time, this is a very good choice!","Date":"October 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Camera","Author":"David Ferguson","ReviewID":"R28HMW0ZWSVYFA","Overall":"good","Content":"I would like to address a few things that have been mentioned.  In one review, someone disliked this camera because of compatibility.  First, I would like to say that I work at a software corporation, and am very familiar with how USB works.  USB does NOT work on NT4.0.  Period.  It does work on Windows 2000, 98, and 95 with certain patches.  If you want to use this camera with NT4.0, you will need a card reader, or a serial cable.  I do believe a serial cable is available for this camera as well.  Also, you can get a floppy disk adapter for the memory card.Secondly, I just purchased this camera, and I am extremely glad that I did.  I was deciding between this camera and the Olympus camera.  The small size is what pushed me toward this one.  After I got it, I realized how easy to use the camera was, and just how convenient the small size is.  The Olympus, also, was made of plastic, making it much more fragile than this camera.  The stainless steel case makes this camera very sturdy.Next, the picture quality is great.  I've used some digital cameras before (this is the first time I've owned one) and this one by far has had the best picture quality that I have seen.  All of the accessories that I need can easily fit in a very small bag if I need to travel, and if I don't, it fits in my jacket pocket.Lastly, the options that this camera gives you is comparable to every other camera in its price range.  The only option that it did not provide that the Olympus camera did was that of Quick Time movies.  Although this would be neat to have, I think that I would never use it because of the amount of memory that it would require.  Because of this, I think this camera is well worth the money, and a very good buy.","Date":"November 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Who says size doesn't matter!","Author":"John A. Radi \"jradi\"","ReviewID":"R1LQC2M5LJ9IXR","Overall":"good","Content":"It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).  A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to \"digital zoom\")Size naturally means  pricey - [and] may seem a little bit much for a point and shoot camera  but but it has one feature which sets apart from all others: it's small  enough that you'll have it with you!  Being a gadget guru - I've owned  about a dozen cameras and this is the first one that I always carry around.The next two features which are equally important in any digital camera  you're considering:2.  Compact Flash Support - Smart Media memory is too  expensive, in short supply, and doesn't seem to be growing in capacity as  quickly as Compact Flash.  So CF seems to be the way of the future in  \"digital film.\"3.  USB support.  Sure, there are floppy  adapters and serial cables which are cheaper - but they're SLOW!  Imagine  copying a 2MB picture through your floppy drive - it would take several  MINUTES vice a few seconds via USB!  If it's cumbersome, you're not going  to use it.  Not only does this have built in USB support (great for sharing  files w/ other PC's), but Compact Flash USB readers are getting cheaper and  that'll save you battery life when downloading to your own pc.The rest  of these features are all on the same level.... 4.  Rechargeable battery.  While it's more convenient to have a camera that uses generic batteries (AA  or AAA) that usually means bulky and not as efficient.  This camera has a  proprietary rechargeable Li-ion battery that comes with a little device so  you can plug it right in the wall and recharge it.  Very compact, recharges  in about 2 hrs, if you're just taking shots using the viewfinder and  letting the camera show you the shot for <2 seconds (best method) then  you can average over 250 shots per recharge!  If you're using the camera's  LCD to take shots then you'll drain the battery in about 85 shots (not  recommended)5. Built-in lens cover.6.  All metal housing - very  durable.  Except for the Compact Flash door - which is plastic (why! ) it's  a very durable casing - unfortunately I'm a little worried about that CF  door!Comments:**No LCD to view memory status, etc...  However, the  LCD window is used to display information.  Can hardly blame Canon, this  thing is so small there's no place to put an LCD panel!**Very few manual  controls, and image quality settings.  There are 3 settings and on the 8MB  included card you can store 4 / 12 / 46 photos depending on which  resolution you choose.  I'd recommend buying a 64MB card asap, and just  take all photos at the highest resolution - you can always decide later to  scale down photos on your pc...**Playback mode.  I had my first camera  for nearly a year before I realized what a benefit it was.  On the fly  share your photo album in anyone's house in their living room, vice  computer desk - makes it easy for sharing with a lot of people.  The Canon  has a unique feature which allows you to flip Vertical pictures (when you  take shots with the camera held vertically).**Very Quick Camera.  The  Elph has an large image buffer so you can take rapid series of photos  quickly.  Depending on image setting, anywhere from 3/9/45 shots before it  dumps to CF Memory (which takes 3 seconds).  Other cameras don't have this  feature and you might have to wait 3 seconds per shot!**Image Quality.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd give it a 9.  Highest resolution prints decent  8x10's which is about all I'd ask from a digital camera.  It's fixed at ISO  100, so it's not exactly a lowlight camera, but it does fine with flash.That's about it - I hope you enjoy yours!","Date":"August 19, 2000"}
{"Title":"This little camera is nearly perfect","Author":"P. Dunn \"I just want things to work right\"","ReviewID":"RB00VCY5F2621","Overall":"good","Content":"The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use. I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera. I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module. Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).  The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom. This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example. While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.The included software works with a unique feature of the camera: \"photostitch\" lets you pan left or right to build a panoramic shot, or even wrap it completely into a 360 degree image. The LCD monitor works to let you see 1/3 of the last picture overlaid on the current one, for near-perfect alignment. When you click on the \"stitched\" images, the software combines them in only two or three steps.You can also put the camera into a \"continuous\" (two shots a second) mode for catching a series of events, and you can \"mark\" images for printing when the CF card is placed in a compatible photo printer. There is also a macro mode available.The unit is tiny (about 2\" x 3\" x 1\") and feels as solid as a tank. Once the software is installed, downloading images to your PC is initiated by simply plugging in the USB cable on the camera and turning it on.It can also work well as a pocket spy camera.","Date":"October 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Kudos to Canon!!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3GMJ42VAHMA89","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned at least 8 or 10 other cameras thru the years.  In the 70's and 80's I used several 35mm SLR's, then got lazy and have had several 35mm point and shoot auto everything cameras.  On two occasions I tried out APS format cameras, the latest being the Canon Elph 370Z.  The APS format cannot hold a candle to 35mm for overall picture quality, but the size and feel of the Elph made up for some of the lost points.  It's failure was in the flash department...totally inadequate and inconstant.  But the size, look and feel of the Elph was wonderful, thus I tried out the Digital Elph S100.  This camera is great.  Point and shoot and 90% of the time you get an excellent photo.  The inferior flash is not as much a problem with digital cameras....I guess they work much like camcorders in that department.  I think anything less than a 2 megapixel digital will not give the results that a 35mm gives and anything over that is overkill for the typical person taking 4x6 snapshots.  This camera is replacing a $200 Olympus point and shoot 35mm that has been an excellent camera, but didn't take a drop off a 10 foot balcony very well.  When you shoot at the default resolution and reduce to 4x6 inch, you will see a sharper 4x6 than any point and shoot 35mm I have used.  To get 10 photo album \"keepers\", I would shoot maybe 20 to 30 shots, discarding 2/3 of them.  With this format, you only get printed the ones you want.  This camera, like any small camera produces bad \"red eye\" with the flash, but with the Adobe Photo Shop that comes with it, you remove the \"red eye\" with just a few clicks of the mouse.  Upload your digital files to Amazon's Ofoto and in less than a week you have beautiful prints.  And since you print only the \"keepers\" it will cost you less in the long run.Now back to this camera, Canon doesn't ship it with the neat little leather case that slides on your belt that comes with the other Elphs.  The one for the Elph-2 fits it perfect and Amazon has it.  The 8MB flash card will give you only about 10 shots, so go ahead and order a 32 or 48MB one.  This is a cool camera that you will enjoy likely more than any other camera you have ever had!","Date":"November 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"The World's Smallest and Cutest Digital Camera","Author":"Jerry P. Danzig","ReviewID":"R1WSAE7TDHWT6Q","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm a writer and new to digital photography.  I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.  I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.  This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.  I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!  First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.  The included battery charger is larger!  Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.  I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)  The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.  The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off. I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.  I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.  But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.  And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.  One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!  Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.  This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!  I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.  As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.  I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.  At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.  It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.","Date":"July 21, 2000"}

It really changes the way you approach photography since you can  edit on the fly, the instant feedback helps you shoot till you get it right! Trial and error - the best way. Tip - after shooting an image hold the shutter button down and the image will show in the LCD screenIt's very well suited to people with a medium level of computer skills (perfect for Mac users)The photo stitch feature is awesome letting you seamlessly join panoramic pics together with supplied software.I recommend the following accessories:1. Extra compact flash card, as large as you can afford, I got the Viking 128 MB2. Extra battery, although the supplied pack is pretty good once it runs out you need a back up. (Get the elph Kit which includes a nice case and a really cool strap for not much more  than a single battery)3. If you plan on using the camera with more than one computer (like home and office) get an extra USB connector so you don't have to bring it with you every time.4. Compact flash reader - I got one of these thanks to other reviewers although I don't use it much. You can upload 50 hi-res pictures in a few minutes with the supplied \"image  browser\" software.

{"Title":"Great Camera","Author":"Louie Escober","ReviewID":"R3MDQTXIEIOVKE","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great camera. I wanted a digital camera to take the place of my point and shoot, and not necessarily my SLR. The Digital ELPH fits that role admirably. It's size is the major plus for me. I take it everywhere with me now and since it's digital, I don't have to worry about wasting film. I just carry it in my front pocket whenever I'm walking around.The resolution is good enough for a nice 5x7, and 8x10 is certainly possible for anybody not too critical of quality. I have noticed a bit of fringing in the pics on occasion, but nothing significant. The USB port allows fast downloads, and the included software is adequate, though I do most of my work in Photoshop. I have noticed a bit more red eye than I'm used to, but I just have to remember to us the red eye reduction feature on the camera. The included 8 mb flash card quickly became insufficient and I got a Lexar Media 48 mb flash card, which gives me about 77 pictures at medium quality (around 500Kb) and about 31 pictures at high quality (around 1.7 mb). Another issue is the battery life. Luckily, the camera comes with a rechargeable battery, unlike the S10 and S20. I'll probably have to get another one of these if I'm out shooting for an extended time.Overall a great camera for just shooting around. I've used it to take photos at work during the holidays and everyone wants one now. It certainly has a high \"coolness\" factor.","Date":"December 15, 2000"}

Much faster than the Olympus D320L I used previously. While the LCD screen is small, you can zoom in on shots in memory (effectively 9x) so it's possible to get a good idea of the quality of any shot. The panoramic mode is incredibly cool - the camera fixes the exposure settings and lets you view the previous shot before you take the next one over. The camera comes with software that aligns and stiches the shots together to form a panorama. I did one set of 12 pictures to form a 180 degree circle shot - amazing.

{"Title":"The ideal \"other\" camera.  Why did I wait so long?","Author":"T. K. Schonhoff","ReviewID":"RB25UDMWIZWXL","Overall":"good","Content":"If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.  Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:Aren't you sometimes annoyed at the size and weight of your big SLR and its collection of delicate lenses?  Are you sometimes intimidated by your own gear, and its seemingly built-in expectation that every photo should be worthy of National Geographic or Life Magazine?  Do you sometimes leave it home or leave it in the bag, rather than intimidate friends and family with your big paparazzi-like weapon?  At a party, a wedding, or just outside playing with the kids, don't you sometimes envy people snapping away with pocket cameras - and wish that taking pictures could be that weightless for you?In other words, admit it - there are times when all your wonderful camera gear just gets in the way.  For years my big Nikon has kept me from taking (and sharing) the kind of family snapshots and casual, experimental pictures that made photography so incredibly popular.  Making copies of pictures was a pain, and mailing them to friends took several weeks from beginning to end.My S100 changed that for me, and I'm having a ball.  Technical nit-picking aside, the images are surprisingly sharp, the colors are accurate and the software is impressively easy to use.  It's shirt-pocket small, yet the stainless steel body makes it feel rock solid.  I've packed it many times to baseball games and a construction site without any fear of bumping something and wrecking the camera.  It sits in the palm of my hand, inconspicuously hidden in my lap or a pocket while I wait for a nice candid moment - something my Nikon couldn't possibly manage.  It even fits easily in my front jeans pocket.  When travelling, the S100 doesn't make me an instant target for purse-snatching thieves or pickpockets the way my camera bag used to.  On airplanes, my one carry-on bag can finally contain something other than camera equipment.As with any digital, I love being able to instantly review my picture, delete it if necessary and re-take it on the spot.  I've saved a few key images that way, and the built-in meter is smart enough that I don't find too many poor exposures.  I boubght a 128 Mb memory card (much more money but well worth it) and can store two hundred plus pictures before downloading.The Canon software that stores and organizes your images is surprisingly good - and makes emailing them very easy and intuitive.  Far from being an afterthought I find it to be an asset and a true feature of the camera.One more thing, one that really surprised and pleased me.  Put a digital camera in the hands of a responsible child and you'll be amazed at the instant flow of creativity that it unleashes.  I did this at a recent party and watched two bored kids go wild for a couple of hours taking fun, bizarre, utterly silly pictures - liberated by the fact that they could be erased at the touch of a button.  It's a great family activity and one I can't recommend highly enough.","Date":"October 16, 2000"}

This camera is GREAT!  I like being able to take lots of pictures and just delete the bad ones.  The small size is awesome--makes it easy to take everywhere.  The kids love seeing the pictures just after they've been taken (and the grownups do too).It's also been nice to use for work, having taken pictures and included them the same day in Powerpoint presentations.Took about 5 minutes to feel comfortable taking pictures, a couple days to understand all the features.  For example, had to get out the manual to understand how to delete unwanted pictures.If you go on a long trip and take lots of pictures, you'll either need to bring your laptop, have multiple expensive chips.  That's true for any digital camera.I would give it 5 stars except I felt a bit nickel-and-dimed by the time I was in business.  Had to buy a larger memory chip (my camera came with 8Mb, I would recommend a minimum of 64Mb--$300), an extra battery so one's always charged (or you might spend the end of a wedding unable to take pictures like me because your battery's charging in the only outlet I could find on the other side of the reception hall when the bride and groom cut the cake).  Also needed to get a case.  I picked up a little neoprene case at an airport Laptop Lane store that was intended for a cell phone but works great.I also have found the software to download the pictures to be a bit buggy.

It's so convenient that you don't even need to think whether a shot worth taking or not anymore.Besides a big CF card, and probably a backup battery, probably you could consider adding a huge harddisk or a CD writer to store your would be albums :-)Best wishes to your photo-taking!Tannie Wu","Date":"November 1, 2000"}

I am very pleased with my purchase. It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:Pros: - smallest 2 megapixel camera availble. - light & easy to carry, fits into your shirt/jacket pocket. - \"zoom\" ability when previewing pictures - 2x zoom moves quickly - very good daylight pictures - very fast downloading of images to PC/Mac via USB cable - provided software works for Windows or Mac - has 3 modes of pictures (640x480, 1600x1200 and 1600x1200 high quality). The images between the two 1600x1200 are indistinguishable on the computer screen. I've enlarged to 5x7 prints and the lower res 1600x1200 looks as good as a normal film camera.Cons: - doesn't come with a case, I used my non-digital Elph case and it fits perfectly as the sizes are exactly the same. - battery lasts only 20 shots or so. Buy a backup. - provided compact flash card (8MB) is too small to store printable pictures (about 12 images). Have to buy another card. - flash works terrible in the dark - can't provide external power without buying a power adaptor kit. - no serial support for download. Either use USB or buy a compact flash adaptor for PCMCIA drives.","Date":"April 18, 2001"}

The size is incredible.  I'd had an APS  ELPH and was fairly happy with the pictures it took so I bought this when I  first saw it.  I love it.  I can carry it in my pocket anywhere.  I bought  a 128MB CompactFlash Card that holds over 200 pictures at the intermediate  setting (I compared this setting to the high setting and honestly have to  enlarge the photo to 600% before I can barely tell the difference).  With  this card, I don't need another.  They have a 192MB Card out now.  If your  going to travel, you'll want an extra battery also.  No other camera on the  market is even close to this for the best all round package.  I've printed  out pictures at different sizes with Yahoo/Shutterfly and at 8x10 you can't  tell the difference from a 35mm handheld.  It is still not as sharp as my  35mm SLR - but that likely has a lot to do with the physical size of the  lense.","Date":"September 5, 2000"}

It's so tiny and easy to use. As an advanced  amateur photographer, I think the only two weak points of S100 are: 1. No  Aperture Priority program mode. 2. A little more color noise compare with  Canon S10, Nikon 950 etc. Some body say S100's green color is not fidelity  but you can fix it in any imaging editor. Besides these two, every thing of  this camera is: EXCELLENT.I need to emphasize one thing: What is the  most important thing in photography no matter you are a pro or snapshot  taker? The answer is: \"Bring the camera with you\". I used to have  3 SLR cameras (2 Nikons and 1 Canon) and 10 lenses. They are great but the  problem is I cannot always take them with me. For the Canon digital camera,  guess what, I take it with me every day. I can shot picture at any time  that I want. Isn't that great?","Date":"July 27, 2000"}
{"Title":"Consistent quality and always in my pocket","Author":"Richard Burge","ReviewID":"R1VW3E5YLSUSRO","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great point and shoot camera. I travel to Mexico a lot and the S100 is just so easy to keep in my little waist pack that reaching for it is second nature. No opportunity gets by me to record where I am or what I see. With the addition of a Viking 64MB flash card, I can capture over 80 shots without even thinking twice about capacity. Indoors, the built in flash is adequate under 10 feet but can overexpose a little close up. Outdoors, images are extremely crisp and detailed without having to go into the superfine 1600 X 1200 mode although overcast provides a little too much blue tinge. While that can be corrected using the accompanying Adobe software, Adobe annoyingly keeps the retouched image in a proprietary format and really increases the file size.I travel with my little Sony Vaio subnotebook (a great combination at less than 3 lbs.) and the USB transfer using the installed Zoombrowser software is effortless and very quick. My evening ritual when I get back to my hotel room is to download the photos into their own daily folder (about a 3 minute task after a full day of shooting), choose the \"keepers\", eliminate the duplicates or those poorly framed, rename them for their location and subject matter and then review them using the Zoombrowser's slide show.When I'm home, I connect my notebook to my television monitor through its S-video input and friends and family enjoy the whole digital experience, kind of like the old days of slides but without the drudgery of trays and the racket of the projector fan. The Canon Zoombrowser works terrific and its installation was effortless.2 megapixels may not be the end-all for digital photography but the S100's mini size and rugged construction make this the camera you'll keep for a long time. If, like me, you have a drawer full of point and shoot 35mm cameras that have provided profoundly inconsistent results, the Digital ELPH is the one for you. Get a spare battery and you're set for a long time!","Date":"December 11, 2000"}

This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR. It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow. Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste). Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc. The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same size as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.

Even though every store in town tried to sell me the S110 (or later model), I stuck to my guns and ordered the S100 (only available through amazon.com it seems).  It's what I wanted.  It takes great pictures.  The software is easy.  The menu-driven display makes sense.  I purchased a 64MB FlashCard and an extra battery to go with it so I wouldn't have to worry about running out of space to store pictures or the lack of a low-battery warning (until it's too late).  I also like the fact that I can plug this puppy into my PC to move the pictures to the screen.  I would suggest adding a case if you purchase this product because now that I have it and I actually like it, I feel a little protective of it and find myself scowling at my husband when he puts it in his pocket, even though it fits easily.

{"Title":"Four Months, Zero Problems; Price break too!","Author":"Rheumor","ReviewID":"R30WVHPW8N5FJO","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this little gem for four months now. It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths. I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera. I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera. I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted. 1) It is perhaps too small. I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on. Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips). 2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system. 3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card (I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res). 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away. It is hot enough to be annoying. Canon says it's normal. I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.These minor carps aside, it's a great little piece of technology, and even better with the recently lowered price.","Date":"November 11, 2000"}
{"Title":"Exceeds my Expectatios","Author":"Donna Roach","ReviewID":"R1JBUOY26KEE3K","Overall":"good","Content":"I too have been checking out digital cameras for a long time.  When the price dropped I jumped on this one.  I absolutely love it.  I've had it just over one month.  I've developed pictures on-line several times and have been very happy. Though I have done the exact picture in two different  (Kodak and Yahoo) and they both have different skin tone.  Can't say which I like better, wish it was somewhere in between.  I love to take pictures of my 4 boys, and in the first few days of practice I've taken so  of the best pictures I have ever taken before.  Fantastic close ups.  It's so easy when you don't have to catch a good one by chance. Take several shots and you know if you have a good one.  The pictures are sharp and clear. (Almost too sharp and clear f you don't have a flawless face.  Thank goodness it is easy to touch up.  I highly recommend Photo Suite III.  You do take the risk of a fuzzy shot if you think you have enough light and you don't use the flash. The camera itself chooses a slow shutter speed with no flash (p.37).  I was also dismayed about not having the ability to use the low resolution with the auto setting, but actually you don't lose any quality of performance in the manual setting.  You just have the ability to change and set some settings.  If you want to keep the settings when you turn the camera off, you just set the mode in the \"saving the shooting\" to last (p.62).  The only problem I have with this camera is that the on/off button is so close to the shutter button.  Many times I've gotten everyone together and smiling and then turned the camera off instead of taking the picture.  Everyone gets tired of that real fast, hopefully I will overcome doing that.  As far as the camera getting hot.  I have left my camera on for an extended time to burn the battery completely out and it barely gets warm.  I found an adorable small purse that everything just fits into.  I just hate camera looking bags.  I would rather wear the camera around my neck to leave my hands free.  So I made a black stretchy slipover pouch that just hugs the camera itself,  I attached a small elastic cord loop to the pouch corner, and that glides along a black cord that I threaded through the camera's wrist strap hole. The pouch stays on the cord when I slide it out to use the camera, and it gives it a little more protection from scratches.  It looks attractive and people don't know it is a camera.  And I don't have to worry about setting it down when I don't have pockets.  The longer you own the camera and more familiar you become with the manual, the more you'll love this camera.  It is very easy to use and gives fantastic pictures.  This is a very cool camera and I would buy it all over again.  I'm very happy with it.....","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

I would just like to give an update of my experiences since that time. This camera and my printer (Epson Photo Stylus 870) have rekindled my interest in serious \"point and shoot\" photography.Over the past 5 months I have taken over 1,000 photos and printed out several hundred. Every person who has seen these pictures have raved about the quality. They all comment on the level of details in these photos which are not seen in drug store quality prints. I have become the unofficial photographer of events within our circle of family and friends.Since the S100 is so compact and easy to use, you won't mind taking it everywhere. Even the most casual photographer will be able to capture the magical moments of life. For me, that's the most important purpose of photography.","Date":"December 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"The \"take everywhere\" 2.1 megapixel choice","Author":"hyperbolium","ReviewID":"R1H96800GGT477","Overall":"good","Content":"I replaced my Canon S10 with an S100 within only a few months of the initial purchase.  Even with its relatively compact size and rugged construction, I found myself leaving the S10 behind more often than not. It was light, it was small, but it wasn't light enough, and it wasn't small enough.The S100 solves that. For the most part, it is an S10 in a smaller, lighter package. Slipped inside your coat pocket, or hanging off your belt in a case, it's barely noticeable.  But take it out to shoot, and the quality and flexibility will astound.As with the S10, the S100 is easy to learn.  Unlike the S10, there is no secondary display on top to provide information on shooting mode, pictures remaining, etc.  The color LCD on the camera's rear shows overlay menus and stats to provide this. In other digital cameras, this might be a serious negative: using up valuable battery power. But given how miserly the S100 is with electricity, the arrangement doesn't seriously impact the number of pictures you can take.And you can take a lot of pictures.  By adding a larger compact flash card, such as the Viking 128MB, you can capture a short vacation's worth of pictures without downloading.  A choice of three different resolution/compression settings helps conserve memory.  The rechargeable battery (included) will nearly see you through the entire 128MB, depending on how much you use the LCD display for shooting and editing.  With a second battery, you're virtually assured that you won't run out of power during a day out. The recharger is multi-voltage, so with a plug convertor, you can recharge your battery in many foreign countries.The electric frugality also means that you're free to edit your shots on the go, snapping a half dozen or more in any circumstance, and deleting all but the best.  This is great for shooting pictures of the camera shy.  They're assured that you're only keeping the \"good\" shots.  It also works well with children, as you can provide them the instant gratification of seeing the picture only seconds after it's been shot.  (This isn't particular to the S100, obviously, but its battery life helps!)A few negatives of the S100: (1) the flash slot is CF1, rather than CF2 (as in the S10 and S20), which means no microdrives. (2) The flash is weak, as might be expected in a camera of this size, and located so close to the lens as to just about guarantee red eye. I've gotten some spectacular examples of the latter. With post-processing you can mitigate the red-eye, but it often takes an artist to really eradicate it. (3) The controls are small, and may be difficult for some fingers. (4) The shutter lag is substantial, making it very difficult to capture action (although the continuous shooting mode helps).  (5) The 2x zoom often leaves me wanting. The 2-megapixel resolution helps, as you can often blow up the middle of a shot and still have sufficient pixels for a smaller print.The programmed exposure modes are adequate, and the manual settings can help, but at its heart, the S100 is a happy snapper. Great for snapshots, but frustrating for sophisticated photographers who find themselves in unusual lighting.  The panaromic mode, combined with the photo stitching software works well.One can discuss the merits and demerits of the 2- and 3-megapixel cameras on the market, but if portability is your primary concern, the S10 is hard to beat.  No matter how good your camera, it won't take good pictures while sitting in a drawer.","Date":"May 24, 2001"}

We just got back from Hawaii, where I did my first serious shooting with this camera, and I had to get online to add my review.  I had been investigating digital cameras for weeks before selecting the Powershot S100. Basically, the consumer reviews I had read here at Amazon convinced me to purchase this camera, and I'm glad I did.  At 2 megapixels, it takes great photos yet doesn't break the bank.  It's extremely compact, solidly built, and very easy to operate, especially in the default automatic mode.  Learning to use some of the more common advanced features, like other flash or exposure settings, is relatively simple, too.  People often comment about the batteries on digital cameras.  I bought a spare with this one based on other users' recommendations, but I haven't had to use it yet.  I found the battery life to be very good, since I did all my shooting through the viewfinder and only used the LCD to review shots afterwards.  I also ordered a 32MB CompactFlash card, which you definitely do need.  At the default 1600x1200 setting, this allows approximately fifty shots on the memory card before having to download to the computer.  If you plan to shot more than that in an outing, then order a larger capacity card.  Bottom line - I'm very happy with my purchase.","Date":"February 23, 2001"}

Took about 150 shots, and used 50 of them. The only reason this camera gets a 4 out of 5 stars is the picture quality. Since I was taking photos outside at night as well as under a number of lighting conditions inside I had to touch up just about every picture that I ended up keeping- the Adobe PhotoEditor software they include is a Godsend. Granted, my picture quality problems are probably because I'm a such a novice, but it was problematic. I've read other reviews where people have complained about the flash (or lack thereof) on this camera, and how it affects the picture quality, and I'd agree.With that said, I've gotten more use out of this camera in the last few days than I have with just about any camera before.

I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities. I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.  This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.First off, the ease of interface with the PC was very good.  I set up the camera, followed the brief instructions in the manual and had no problems setting up the camera to interface with my PC (I've got Windows 2000).Second, the quality of the pictures is fantastic!  I have used the amazon.com site to get the pictures developed like a \"real\" camera, and have been very pleased with what I have gotten back.  I have also used the pictures on a Ceiva Digtial Picture frame, and that has worked very well too.Third, the camera's features are top-notch.  The black and white ability, as well as the piece-meal panorama pictures (you put them together with the included software) are great.

All controls are very intuitive (the zoom surrounds the shutter release & all camera functions are monitored on the LCD at the rear of the camera).Photo clarity is great at the Large/Fine setting for 5x7 prints, however, anything larger will require the Large/Super fine setting.  The standard 8mb compact flash card is only adequate (12 pictures at the Large/Fine setting and only 4 at the Large/Super fine setting).  I recommend at least a 32mb card which will increase the storage capacity to a 35mm SLR's with a large roll of film.  I also recommend purchasing the Canon accessory kit (leather case, neck chain & spare battery).Included software is very easy to use and don't forget Canon offers 50mb of storage on their web site to their digital photo customers at no charge.  A neat benefit since family and friends can access this site and view your latest photos.All in all, I'm very satisfied with this purchase!If you're looking for a moderately priced digital camera (@ $600 including the camera, case, battery, neck chain and 32mb card) this is the one!

{"Title":"Small, delightful and well-designed","Author":"John White \"weasel rancher\"","ReviewID":"R2060GFBKEAOYD","Overall":"good","Content":"My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images. The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it. The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it. But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.The larger the CompactFlash card that you use, the slower  it takes for the ELPH to turn on. It takes about 2-3 seconds of pressing  the on button plus 2 more seconds till you can shoot a picture. I  understand this is to prevent automatic turn-ons but sometimes I want to  immediately take a picture.That aside, this is a great camera. I bought  a 32mb CompactFlash to go with it and shoot in Fine mode (1600x1200  compressed) and get about 50-60 images. It takes about 4 seconds to  transfer each picture via USB to my Apple G3 PowerBook.The QTVR  (panorama) generating software is great. It eliminates much of the hard  work for the user. But you really need to keep it on a stable surface to do  this well.I also have an ELPH Jr. APS camera. (With a black body before  Canon changed it.) It got it because it was so portable (i.e. usable). This  is every bit as enjoyable. I rarely ever use the flash. The zoom works  perfectly fine, though I'm not much of a zoom user. My friend has an S10  and his pictures are a little better, but the S100 wins out for its  tremendous portability.","Date":"July 4, 2000"}

The camera was the hit of the tour. I could have sold a half-dozen at least to my tour-mates. I brought along three 48-MB compact flashes, and filled them, getting 71 or 72 pix per unit.Using the small screen as a viewfinder helped me compose better photos. I can't say why this worked better for me than the viewfinder of a single-lens reflex, but it did. Previously, my making a particularly well-composed photo came under the heading of \"Even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while.\" My percentage using this marvellous little camera was much better.

But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.The S100 is very small, and easily  fits in a pocket.  It is much easier to use than the A5 Zoom was (there are  only 2 main camera modes: take pictures or review stored pictures), and I  haven't had to consult the manual since the day I bought the camera.  Picture quality is excellent, in my opinion. The S100 comes with a USB  cable to download pictures to your PC, which provides a massive speed  improvement over the serial connection of the A5 Zoom.  The software  supplied with the camera is also a major improvement, IMO, over the  software supplied with the A5 Zoom.  I found it much easier to browse &  access my pictures with the new software.  The S100 has an optical/digital  zoom which isn't terribly powerful, but is a nice feature, and as with the  A5 Zoom, the LCD display is excellent.  Unlike the A5 Zoom, the S100 comes  with a battery charger in the box (Yes!).About the only negative thing  I can say about this camera is that the 8MB CompactFlash card supplied with  the camera only holds 12 pictures at the \"Large\" (1600x1200)  setting.  So you'll most likely need to purchase a larger CF card if you  want to take this camera on trips.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the  S100.","Date":"July 26, 2000"}

You won't miss those frequent opportunities to capture life's remarkable moments again.  Photography is a great hobby of mine, and I love my 35mm and APS cameras *but*.. this little digital has opened up a new world for me.  I now have a camera with me when I normally would not to catch those special photo opportunities.  The Elph doesn't give you all the operations of a conventional SLR, but it does give you the basic settings to compose excellent quality everyday pictures.I'll start with the \"Pro's\":  The small size makes this camera one to hang out with ALL the time.  Excellent quality high resolution output.  I *love* taking great panoramic \"photostitch\" pictures.  The macro setting is also fun to play with.  You can get as close as 4 inches from your subject.  Pretty neat from a fixed lens. It is super easy to set up camera and install the software.  Don't lug around those big photo albums!  With the supplied video cable (VC-200) you can put on a great picture show for your friends in your house or theirs all from the palm of your hand. The Canon ZoomBrowser software is very intuitive and easy to use. Adobe PhotoShop software stirs your creative juices and I promise will turn you into a digital Picasso.The \"Con's\":  Battery life is zapped too quickly (about 1/2 hr) (A battery charger is included in the kit and it takes about 2 1/2 hours to recharge the batteries - which which you can expect according to the manual to last for only 300 charges).  You'll definately want a spare battery!  No camera case is included.  The included 8 mg CF disk can only hold a few pictures.  I just purchased the Viking CF128M 128 MB CompactFlash Card from Amazon at an excellent price.  Red eye only works marginally, you'll need to run many of those pics through Adobe Photoshop.  The Elph is not geared for those outdoor night pictures, even if there are lots of city lights.  Evening city light pictures I took ended up dim but that could be because I'm still learning how to optimize all the settings.So, besides the cost of this camera, I have had to fork out another $250.00.  Get ready to lay out even more if you want the power supply and CF adapter.Look at it this way, you won't have any expensive film or photo processing charges.  Gratification is instant.  Isn't that worth the price of admission?","Date":"January 8, 2001"}

{"Title":"Great camera! Perfect for serious but not professional user","Author":"Michael C. Reynolds \"reynoldm\"","ReviewID":"R2R7KDGRNPQI3O","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera after looking around for a digital for quite sometime. I looked at so many cameras out there, but I decided on a few things I was looking for. First, I wanted at least 2 megapixels for high quality photos. And this camera delivers! I love the picture quality. Second, I wanted something from a brand known to be high quality. I have been happy with everything I have ever bought from Canon and I hear relatively few complaints about their products. Third, I wanted something small so it's easy to take around. This camera is perfect for the pocket!The camera has been a joy to use. I found all the functions easy to find and it only took a few hours of playing around with it to get everything down. The only thing I get a little frustrated with is how still you need to be when taking pictures in low light. The camera can take great pics in low light, but you must keep the camera very still. I recommend taking several shots to make sure you get a good one.The hook-up to the computer was very easy, but you must have a USB port. I found all the software decent, but unless you have someone helping you, the photo editing tools take a while to learn. The software is good though, contrary to what you may have read in other reviews. I suspect that people who knock the software just got frustrated on learning it.Overall, a great camera. Most everyone will go \"wow\", great pictures and easy to use. Only thing better would be 3 megapixels, but most people won't need it.","Date":"January 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"First impressions","Author":"Wm Grayson","ReviewID":"R3VMM1UURRG73T","Overall":"good","Content":"First; To the Bay Area Electronics Fan who posted an Email on 13 June. The S100 has an Compact Flash Card type I slot and will not accommodate the IBM Microdrive.  To My review.  I paid full price at Frys and don't regret it a  bit.  The lack of features as compared to say the Oly 3030 Zoom or the  Nikon 950, or the Ricoh 5000 all of which I own is more than made up for by  the S100's small size and ease of use.  The quality of the S100's output is  impressive. The only negative comments I have are the \"Icons\"  used to define the camera's different modes, ie; B&W. The Icons are  small and not very readable for someone with less than 20:20 eyesight. Not  only that, they don't seem to make much sense. All in all, for the money in  my opinion it's the best camera in it's class.","Date":"July 2, 2000"}
{"Title":"Know your needs.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3RYHTFE0DJFZZ","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is not intended to replace your 35mm. Frankly neither can the more advanced digital camera's currently on the market...yet. If you do the math to print a 8X10 at 300 dpi. you would need 3000 X 2400 resolution...no doubt it's coming... The S100 has limited optical zoom (the digital zoom, as in other digital camera's deteriorates the image quality relative to zoom used)...the zoom \"frames\" close-ups nicely, the camera is not all that great in low light situations (equivalent to ISO 100), the flash is effective up to about 10 feet...OK for a point and shoot camera, it comes with a 8mb card...not enough...32 would be nice unless you intend to keep your images in your camera instead of your computer...then by all means get one with even more memory...I don't see the point. It does come with a charger...the S10 does not...while the S10 appears to take somewhat better pictures...unless you are an expert you won't be able to tell the difference...to me size matters so I bought the S100. Again, if you are looking to replace your 35mm with a digital this is not the camera for you.  Otherwise this is a great little (tiny) point and shoot camera that shoots great images, will not be left behind like my 35mm often is and will capture your fondest memories effectively.  The camera works well, is constructed like a piece of jewelry, is robust...feels that way anyhow and will serve you well as a high quality point and shoot camera. The manual says that unless you have Win98 or 2000 \"originally\" installed on your computer the USB function may not work...it worked fine for me...excellent software package for the novice digital photographer...eh... :)","Date":"October 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Most practical camera","Author":"Ryan Parasram \"parasram\"","ReviewID":"R3L34USZ37DWFQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures. I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card. Here are some useful facts:- On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures. A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture). The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken. The LCD should be used. However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder. The digital zoom is crap. Turn it off. It fits in your pocket. The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp). But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera. I take my camera everywhere. Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera. The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff. The panorama setting is unbelieveable ! You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing ! The pictures are a little dark sometimes. You have the option to have the flash automatic or off. I would have liked to force the flash on as well.","Date":"January 25, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great camera, but some cons.","Author":"A. Bowman","ReviewID":"R1YXEHQT2OPJXV","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera at the end of August.  With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.  I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.The camera:  Amazing size; it is literally about the size of a deck and a half of cards.  It fits into my pants pocket or my chest pocket without a problem.  Great pictures, especially in daylight.  I went for a walk with my dog today and took a picture in the midday sunlight and I got back and it was fabulous.  But pictures with the flash aren't that great, unfortunately.  The foreground usually gets too bright and the backround not light enough.  The 2X optical zoom is great but the 2X digital zoom doesn't do much I've found.  The resolution is good enough so that you can take a picture using optical zoom and then crop the part you want and it will still be a good sized picture.  The software that comes with camera is adequate.  It lets you view the pictures you take and then edit them a little bit, extract redeye was the feature I used most.  But there are many other great features that I haven't really explored, but I have played around with a little.The battery:  It probaly lasts about a half hour using the LCD screen.  But if you just point and snap using the traditional viewfinder the camera lasts very much longer.  It takes about an hour to charge with the included charger that plugs right into any outlet.  I would recommend buying an extra battery.Also I would recommend buying a carrying case, the Canon Powershot case is an excellent fit and also has a small pounch on the front for an extra CF card and/or battery.  I bought a 128MB card which is great when you go away for a while and won't have access to your computer.  But I found that I rarely fill up even half the card which holds 210 pictures at medium resolution.  The Viking Flash Reader is a nice touch, although definitely not needed.  It allows you to upload pictures a bit faster without wasting the battery of the camera.All in all here's what you really need:1. An extra battery pack.2. A bigger CF card, 48MB is sufficient, 64 is really nice.3. A carrying case to protect your investment.It's a lot of fun too!","Date":"January 3, 2002"}
{"Title":"Convenient, Compact, Quality Digital Camera","Author":"R. Seccia \"ronseccia\"","ReviewID":"R1R4MD2DQEAIIF","Overall":"good","Content":"I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100... after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.I wanted a digital camera to replace my 35mm point and shoot - primarily for snapshots of my kids at various events.  I wanted something I could easily take with me without having to \"lug\" around a big piece of equipment.  I wanted quality images to email to family members AND to occasionally produce quality prints.  I also wanted the ability to transfer the images easily to my PC.  The s100 delivers on all points.ProsCompact Size.  Did you ever go somewhere with your camera and feel like carrying it with you was an annoyance and a hindrance to enjoying yourself?  Before I bought the s100, I would usually bring my 35 mm point and shoot instead of my SLR simply because of the size.  Now I take my s100 everywhere which means more and better pictures.  You can slip it into your pocket and take it anywhere without that \"burdened feeling\" of carrying around a big camera.  The s100 is very small (about the size of a deck of cards)  yet comfortable to use.  Some other digital cameras like the Sony Mavica are much bigger and to me, carrying them around is a hassle.Image Quality.  This camera takes excellent quality images.  Outdoor photos are superb.  Images shot indoors using the flash are very good although sometimes a bit under exposed which is the case with most digital cameras in this class.  The macro (close up) function works incredibly well.  I ordered prints from images produced on the high resolution/fine setting which came out great.  Realistically,  there is no digital camera substitute (yet) for a good 35mm SLR in terms of image quality on prints.  But if you're considering replacing your 35mm point and shoot with a digital, the s100 is an excellent choice.Video Out.  The S100 comes with a video cable that allows you to connect the camera to a TV to display the images.  At first, I couldn't care less about this feature as I figured I'd never use it.  Wrong.  I use this more than I thought - like when I took photos at a birthday party and everyone wanted to see the pictures.  Instead of  people crowding around the little camera, I connected it to the TV, set it to auto-display, and we watched a slide show of all the pictures!  This is handy if you have family members without a PC since you can record the photos to VHS tape.Con'sLimited Resolution Settings.  This camera has only two resolution settings: 640x480 (fine compression) and 1600x1200 (fine and superfine compression).  So, you need to decide before shooting what you plan to do with the images.  The lower resolution is for online viewing and email while the higher resolution is better for making prints.  A medium setting such as 1024 x 768 would be nice since it's acceptable for both online viewing and producing small (4x6) prints.No Battery Life Indicator.  This camera has no indication of how much battery life you have left.  You get an indicator when the battery is low but by then it's too late.  It would be nice to have an estimate of the time remaining.Small Optical Zoom.  This camera has only a 2X optical zoom which is on par with most of the cameras in this class.  This is sufficient when shooting subjects that are fairly close but a higher powered optical zoom would be nice.  Digital zoom degrades the image so I suggest turning it off.Low Light / Fast Action.  You really need an adequate light source when shooting indoors to get an optimum picture.  Generally, the flash works well if you're within several feet of your subject but further away you need to have sufficient ambient light.  This camera is also not a great choice for fast action shots like sporting events.  You can use the continuos shoot mode but it is pretty much hit and miss.  The low light / fast action issues are typical for most digital cameras in this class.  If you plan to shoot a lot under these conditions, you'll need a higher end camera or a good 35mm film camera.AccessoriesBattery.  I didn't buy a second battery and  so far haven't needed one.  It will all depend on your picture taking habits.  If you plan to use the camera over a long period such as a vacation, I recommend a second battery.Compact Flash (CF) Card.  You DEFINITELY need a larger CF card than the 8MB included with the camera.  I bought a 32MB card which is sufficient for my needs.  I typically shoot at the high resolution using fine compression which gives me about 60 shots on the 32MB card.  Using superfine I'd get less than half that.  If you plan to take many pictures at the highest resolution/superfine compression, you'll need even more memory.CF Card Reader.... I don't use any of the software that came with the camera.AC Adapter.  If you get a CF Card reader you will not need an AC Adapter unless you plan to use the camera for extended periods.Summary. I love this camera!  It has its limitations like all digital cameras in this category....","Date":"March 20, 2001"}

I have seen photo's on the internet but believe me..there is nothing like the real thing! This one truly makes you fall in love with it the first time you see it.When you buy this cam...also get an extra battery, flash card and protective case. Many tips has already been said in these reviews so I'm going to add to it. One review said that the person had tremendous trouble installing the software on a Win98 platform. My first installation was succesfull. I used Win98 second edition to help with the installation. Something you should keep in mind. The SP100 only supports USB transferring of data to your PC. So you need a USB port attatched to your motherboard. The latest boards has a USB port. But the older ones ( which is not that long ago ! ) does not have a port and you have to buy a USB card to plug into your motherboard. I had to do that.The rest of the installation and connection to the camera is mind blowing easy and quickly ! Downloading photo's to your pc is like saying 1,2,3.Then something another reviewer said. Sometimes the photo's tend to be a bit dark. Quite true. But you CAN force the flash to stay on. You also can set the flash on Slow-Syncro mode which adjusts itself to the slow shutter speeds. You can also set the exposure compensation and the white balance.There are a few more things the cam can do. I will name some of them. Shooting continuously, ( 2 images per second until you release the button), a timer ( takes a photo after 10 seconds ), shooting close-ups, stitch photo's together, replay images on your TV (realy cool), and taking black and white photo's.The software is okay...nothing to rave about !

{"Title":"Smallest digital camera which is any good - & waterproof!","Author":"Bruce Boyes","ReviewID":"ROKULTGELY05E","Overall":"good","Content":"I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use. I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking). This is the only camera with all these capabilities. Even with the waterproof housing it is small. The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap. The metal housing seems very rugged. Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds. I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes. For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that. The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds. You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background. The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260. The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus. The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery. The panorama modes are wonderful. Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field. High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly. It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere. In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera. The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure). 1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s. There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact. It's a little jewel.","Date":"November 24, 2000"}
{"Title":"A great camera for everyone except the pro's","Author":"Thomas A. McLaughlin","ReviewID":"RJ6HG5PHX1O3T","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought this camera at Christmas but I delayed writing a review until we returned from our long-planned cruise down the Nile.  The camera was excellent.  We took nearly 300 pictures, and most looked quite good in spite of our lack of photographic experience (or instincts).  It traveled quite easily and even survived an unexpected camel gallop while swinging wildly around my neck.Hints: We got the camera at a discount by waiting until a local photo shop featured \"Canon Day\" with special deals on Canon products.  For us this happened around the holidays. Extra flash cards are a must, but the amount will depend on the longest interval you expect before downloading.  We did not bring a computer, so we needed lots of megabytes worth of storage.  Flash cards go on sale in different sizes at different times from different stores, so pay attention.  I scored some cards cheap when a local Office Depot store closed down and sold off their inventory at low prices.  Tip - calculate the cost per megabyte to better compare various vendors' functional prices.  The sweet spot these days seems to be 32 meg cards. Although the camera travels well in your pocket, a small inexpensive belt-mounted camera case helps keep an extra battery and flash cards in one place. You'll definitely want a second battery if you do more than, say, 35-40 photos before re-charging.  We only used the second battery twice because we only turned on the display when needed. Don't bother buying a neck strap.  When you go to a professional conference and ask for a neck strap instead of a pin or clip for your name tag.  After the conference, put the neck strap on the camera. The menu is pretty intuitive, but just to be sure we re-typed some basic settings in a small font on a small piece of paper and laminated it.  It's a tribute to the user-friendliness of the camera that we rarely used the card after the first day or two.Negatives:The zoom is anemic, probably because they had to make trade-offs somewhere.Low light photos are poor, although this may be my lack of experience.The thing is almost too small and light - I constantly had to check to make sure I still had it.The software isn't bad, but it still isn't as intuitive as it should be, especially Zoom Browswer Ex.Definitely a good purchase.  You won't be disappointed.","Date":"June 3, 2001"}

This thing is tiny, and silver, and made of metal. It looks hot, it feels sturdy. Many people have come up to me to ask about it.2) Portability. I take it everywhere, literally. It's in my purse and goes everywhere with me so I never miss the perfect picture of a gorgeous sunset or my husband doing something funny. The size is also good because it's unobtrusive -- SLRs can get in the way at parties and inhibit \"natural\" pictures because people are too aware of the camera. The S100 is less invasive -- it's quick, it's small and it's fun, and that's the way picutures of friends and family come out because of it.3) Quality. The pictures are very good quality. I almost never take my Canon 35 mm SLR out any more because the S100 takes great photos and is so incredibly portable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this can replace an SLR if you're a serious arty photo buff. But the ease of use and portability of it makes up for the minimal drop in quality. Compared to my friends' digital cameras, the S100 takes superior pictures, even at the middle quality setting. As for prints, I bought a Canon BJ color printer for a couple hundred bucks and the prints are superb!4) Memory. Compact flash, while still pricey, is the least expensive common form of removeable media. Don't count Iomega's click disks which are cheap but aren't widely used. Stock up on CF -- if you're anything like me you'll need a lot of CF cards because you won't want to stop taking pictures. I have used cards from the major manufacturers in the following sizes with no problems: 96, 64, 15, 8. Removeable memory is WAY better than embedded because when you use up the space, you can just pop in a new card and keep shooting.The negatives:1) Weak flash. If you're inside, you had better be no farther away from your subject than 10 feet in a lit room and 5 feet in a dim room.2) Micro focus. The focus is a little flakey on very small objects. I like close up shots, and if I'm trying to shoot a small insect or flower (maybe half as small as a dime) the focus has trouble finding it. There is no manual override. This is semi-reasonable, but still disappointing. Other than this extreme close up limitation, the focus is great.3) Short battery life. This problem is not unique to the S100. It's no problem really, just make sure to get 1-2 spares. Mine lasts me about 2 hours of solid use. If you're planning to take it on a trip, just make sure you bring the charger (included) and spare batteries.Bottom line, the pros far outweigh the cons. I couldn't be happier with the camera. If you're serious about getting a digital camera, you must buy this one.","Date":"March 23, 2001"}

First of all, contrary to some of the reviews on this site, USB absolutely does not work with NT.  And the opitonal Cannon Serial Port cable is not compatible with the S100.  So you have 2 options, 1) a PC (pcmcia) CF adapter card or 2) a Parallel port CF card reader.  Sand Disk makes both and I've used both successfully.Options #1 is cheaper (about $15) but it will only work if you have card wizard installed as NT does not dynamically recognize PC cards.  Card Wizard comes loaded on some newer model laptops like IBM thinkpad, so if you have card wizard this is the cheaper, faster and easiest way to go.  If you have an older model laptop without card wizard then your machine might hang if you boot it with the card seated.  If you insert it after boot it will not be recognized.  You can purchase card wizard separately but it's about $80 so if you don't already have it I'd recommend options #2Option #2 is a CF card reader that plugs into your parallel port.  It costs about $50 and has a Y connection so you can maintian your printer connection and the disk reader at the same time.  It seeam to be a bit slower than the PC card and is more combersome to pack/unpack...I hope this helps some poor sole as I burned many hours figuring this out.p.s.

I want a small, compact, digital camera that delivers. The S100 is definitely it. It takes amazing pictures and is easy to use. Even if you aren't really familar with the menu and the options, all you do is spend 20 to 30 minutes to read the manual, you are set. It is light and fits easily in your pocket. You don't even know you are carrying it sometimes. I take a lot of pictures of people (strangers I ask if I can take their picture), and since it looks so unique and interesting,  the camera eases the people I take pictures of - instead of sticking that zoom lens in someone's face- its the ultimate icebreaker, and then after I am done, I show them the picture and they are always happy. What a great hobby. I'm documenting cities and people I come across, and the little S100 is such a great help. People can't help but ask about it and participate - this camera is great! Plus the picture quality is outstanding. No complaints here!*I would recommend buying an extra battery and flashcard that has more megs. I bought a 32 meg card and I can store an amazing amount of pictures on it. I guess it comes down to preference depending on how many pictures you store- I tend to spend a day taking pictures and when I'm home, upload them to my machine, so I don't need a enormous card. But either way, this camera takes amazing pictures, is fun, and is small. What more can you ask for? I haven't had any problems with it, so I have nothing but good things to say.

The menu functions are easy to read and the  lcd monitor is sharp for it's size. The only thing I would recommend is  that you upgrade the 8mb compact memory card since you can only take 11  pictures at 1200 x 1600 resolution and 46 at the lowest resolution. The  software is super easy to use and once you connect the USB port to the  camera, the sofware automatically opens up with the pictures right in front  of you. It's a great buy and no one will be disappointed.","Date":"September 19, 2000"}

{"Title":"Its an awesome camera, but.......","Author":"Arturo Delgadillo","ReviewID":"R1PAUWRO7FK4IP","Overall":"good","Content":"Si, I bought this cool Canon camera for way below price with a 128 Viking CF card. The camea is great, smallgood looking and takes really good pics. At 2.1 megapixels you dont have to worry about running up tons of storage space and the quality is more, yeah more than good for average user.Cons.-- the battery drains way way to fast you basically also most have to buy two to have fun and/or carry the charger, which is small with a cool flip up plug. Another thing I might find annoying is that you can't change the image quality in auto mode. They are set to mid and I personally think its to big, especially for the 8 meg CF card. It then will only hold about 7 pictures. Wah wah wah.I think I wouldlhave enjoyed this a bit more if it came with a tiny remote for the self timer, Why? So i can shot myslef and not everyone else. :DBuy the camera -----Ive had a few and this is a great value and great pictures.Arturo Delgadillo","Date":"November 28, 2001"}

I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.  I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!Usability - Ihave to admit, I abhor reading manuals, so after charging thebatteries I immediately dove in, pressing buttons and whatnot.  I wasalmost instantly rewarded with the ability to shoot very high qualityphotos, browse through the results, and file manage my pictures.  Thesoftware install was a snap, and the plug-n-play of USB PCconnectivity is truly a godsend.  I remember not that long ago digitalcameras had floppy drives in them, and the \"flash\" media usedwas 1.44 MB floppy disk drives!Performance - Again I was verypleased with the features included in this camera.  The Macrofunction, in particular, is stellar.  I've not had a chance to playwith the various black and white, exposure, and landscaping featuresyet - but the next trip I take this little guy is definitely comingalong.Expandability - The camera comes with an 8 MB memory flashcard - which can be upgraded to 128 MB card that can store manymore pictures.  The 8 MB card stores 16 pictures at the defaultresolution, whereas the 128 MB card can store around 300 (I believe,I'm still waiting for mine to be delivered).  Now that's what I callexpandability.  Also, the unit comes with a DV connector - oh thepossibilities...Looks - OK, so beauty is subjective, blah,blah, blah.  This camera is a beaut!  It's small yet feels verysturdy, and the all metallic shell gives it a very post-modernistic,cutting-edge look and feel (how can a camera be post-modernistic youask?  It's a digital camera - the whole paradigm ispost-modernistic!).I unequivocally recommend this product to anyonewho is looking for a digital camera (and even those who are but don'tknow it yet).","Date":"April 9, 2001"}
{"Title":"The secret to getting a great shot","Author":"D. Blickstein","ReviewID":"R277463T1B5161","Overall":"good","Content":"What is the best tip for getting a great shot?Well, I think it's a non-obvious one: having the camera with you when the shot presents itself.For years I've had mostly bulky SLRs that I often opted to leave behind rather than deal with and/or risk breaking when hung from my neck.  Then I got a Canon Elph.  I rarely used anything else - with it's nifty little belt pack, there's no reason not to bring it, and I can \"draw\" the camera out and shoot as fast as any gunslinger.  It was the only camera I brought on a tour thru Italy.The digital version of the Elph has most of the same advantages: it  produces a very high quality photo, with all the essential exposure options in a very very small convenient package.The negatives about it are: a very non-intuitive interface and a lack of a belt pack (you can buy one of course).  Of course, you'll absolutely want a (much) larger memory card too.  But if they improved the user interface (I still am confused and I am a gadget guy but I'm figuring it out) it would be as close to a \"perfect product\" as you're likely to see.So... if you want a nice handy little cam, and aren't afraid of devoting some time to the manual and experimentation, go for it.  If you absolutely need something with an intuitive interface, you might want to fool around with one in the store before you buy to see if you can pick it up.","Date":"December 29, 2000"}

{"Title":"One great camera!","Author":"Amazon Customer","ReviewID":"R1L28QR5C89WGC","Overall":"good","Content":"Back in the 70's, I had a minature Rollei 35 mm camera with a Zeiss lens. I took that camera everywhere and made tons of great pics, many of which I had blown up and framed. Unfortunately my ex wife got that camera in my 1983 divorce! Over the years I've accumulated several SLR cameras with numerous lenses and tripods. Again I found myself increasingly carrying a point and shoot camera most of the time. When I saw the digital Elph, I knew that this was the Digital cam I wanted, and I've not been disappointed. My current wife carries it in her purse all the time. Works great, no complaints. This camera has a high \"drool\" factor--you'll get lots of \"oohs and ahhs\" by those who see it.You will want an extra battery, another flash card (I bought a 64 meg flash card) and a flash card reader. With the flash card reader, you just take the flash card (the film, in essence) out of the camera, put it in the flash card reader, and your computer reads the flash card just as if it were an extra A: floppy drive. You can drag and drop pics into your select directory on your computer, and as they pile up on your hard drive, save them on a Zip drive or a CD if you have a read/write CD Rom.Camera is a piece of cake and no complaints so far.","Date":"April 18, 2001"}

After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.2.1 mega-pixels (2.02 effective, according to manual) is nothing to write home about -- and the Canon continues to take under-saturated pictures -- but the picture quality is top-rate, besting many 3-mp cameras I have tested.  The quality shows when you print the images, even at 5\"x7\".  I use an Epson 875DC and the images are many times better than those taken with my other digicams, even under the same shooting conditions.This camera is also easy to use; you can start shooting away after you unpack and charge the included LiIon battery.  The LCD viewfinder is small but very clear.  One good thing: your nose won't touch the LCD when you use the optical viewfinder (unless you have a very small face).  Battery life is decent: I get about 50 shots with all flash and LCD on.  Obviously you get more if you turn off LCD, and even more if you don't need flash all the time.This camera turns heads.  Every time I take it out I can hear people around me talking about it.  Some will ask me if they can hold it.  I'm always proud to tell them that it takes great pictures, too.  I love this little camera.So, what are you waiting for?","Date":"January 12, 2001"}
{"Title":"Canon S100 Great Camera","Author":"G. Hill","ReviewID":"R1VQ51LVADDAWD","Overall":"good","Content":"Hi, I just bought one of these jewels about 2 weeks ago.  It is such a joy to have something this compact and versatile.  We live in Manhattan and have a 3 year old. So we carry a lot when we go out.  This is why the...is such a nice thing for us.  Put it in the pocket and go.  We added a Sandisk 64MG compact flash card (... after shipping from amazon) and a 2nd battery (...).  This will give you the ability to shoot about 43 pictures at the highest quality setting.  The camera produces sharp pictures and having a computer to edit and print the pictures gives you a geat deal of creative freedom.  It has occurred to me that if you were not computer savvy, that digital cameras might prove to be a challenge at first, but one worth meeting.  However, if you have no stomach for technical things, stick with your 35mm. Also one should keep in mind that 2 megapixel digital pictures are not as sharp as good 35mm pictures, however; the quality of the S100 will please anyone but the most demanding, and remember this camera is made for conveniently capturing good snapshots in a digital format.  In that regard, I have never been so excited about documenting our experiences and we have already taken more pictures in 2 weeks than in the past year with my old clucky 35mm. I have a HP 932C printer (...) It prints great pictures.  Print on HP Premium Plus Photo Paper.  It is the heaviest stock, 145lb.

Nice outlook, solid and compact, but the 6oz weight still let you feel it is there in your pocket. 2. Longer battery life than S10&S20. Still better to carry a secondary battery (...) with you.  3.  Fast image compression and large memory buffer to quickly allow the next  shot. 4. In general, satified image quality.Cons: 1. Not like the S20,  won't support CF-2, ie.,not compatible with microdrive. 2. The camera  cannot record the right color in some condition, e.g., the flash light may  cause the non-red surface to be distorted into red color. 3. The usb  connection cover is made by plastics, which is easy to break off. 4. If you  want to review the photo right after shot. 1. Your finger needs to remain  on the shutter button right  after the shot.(can be locked with another  button). 2. Or you have to switch from the record mode to the play mode.  This is kind of awkwards. Should have a dedicated options for shot review.  5. Each battery takes two hours to fully charge. You may not get it in  hurry. You cannot buy the equivalent disposal battery in 7-11 store.","Date":"June 23, 2000"}
{"Title":"The Perfect Camera for \"Fun Photos\"","Author":"Cliff Bauer \"Cliff\"","ReviewID":"RO2X88PB35XVP","Overall":"good","Content":"My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card. Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.Three things make this camera a particularly good buy:First, and most importantly, its size makes it SO CONVENIENT. I have had absolutely no qualms dropping the S100 in a bag or pocket and walking out to a birthday party, a sports event, or whatever--space simply isn't an issue with this camera. As a result, I have taken some of the best shots of friends and family with the Canon.Second, the feature set is basic, but very easy to use. The power button is a simple button--no toggle thumb switches with multiple settings that can sometimes be confusing. Switching between viewing and capturing modes is simple and straightforward, and even the more advanced features (such as changing the flash mode) are easy to figure out even without reading the manual.Finally, the \"built in\" lense cap is a big plus. I didn't realize how nice this \"feature\" is until I briefly used a friend's digital camera and had to remove and replace the lense cap WITH EVERY SHOT. The built in cap seems insignificant with light use, but when taking many shots over the course of a few hours, the S100 really shines.Photographers should be warned, however, that the S100 is not a professional-level camera by any means. The 2.1 megapixel resolution, while not meager, is not enough to yield even high-quality 5x7's. Serious cropping of a photo is usually out of the question because of the limited resolution.So, if you will be using your camera as a \"fun\" camera--for casual pictures--look no further. This is the one. If you're serious about picture quality, compare the S100 carefully to its larger siblings--the S20, and the G1.Overall, a fantastic little camera.","Date":"June 16, 2001"}
{"Title":"not bad--for better quality pics get 3.1Mpix or higher","Author":"SL","ReviewID":"R1WHJVSKSM58M5","Overall":"good","Content":"If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design. The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.The jury rated the S100's prints in the middle of the pack, but its overall image quality results fell at the low end of the midlle for 2-megapixel cameras. Color balance measured better than average, with a noticeable blue cast in images shot under outdoor lighting conditions. Though the S100 only offers center-weighted metering, we overcame a tough indoor-exposure situation by using both exposure and focus locks. Other 2-megapixel cameras offer a more powerful zoom lens and more image-control settings.The flash worked fine for shots taken at the maximum-rated distance under indoor lighting conditions, but it overexposed images taken inside at the minimum-rated macro distance. We were impressed with the sharpness of macro images captured outdoors with no flash. Standard shots taken without flash under outdoor lighting conditions showed slight underexposure but accurate color. The S100's panorama mode worked effectively, as did its burst mode, in which we captured one shot per second at the high-resolution and high-compression settings and three shots every 4 seconds at the high-resolution and low-compression settings.The S100 feels balanced in its shiny stainless steel case and flattens to a smooth, flat box when the lens retracts; an integrated cover protects the lens when retracted. External control buttons are minimal, because you adjust most of the setting through menus, but, unfortunately, the relatively small LCD and small menu font present an operational challenge.The S100's bright LCD displays a graphical menu system which attempts simplicity, but misses the mark and leads you back to the User Guide to clarify navigation and features at every turn. It can be frustrating to use the small LCD to take advantage of the camera's effective panorama mode, but better that than using the viewfinder in this mode. The S100 can be ready to capture your first shot in 3 seconds and subsequent shots every 7 seconds.Compared to others in its class, the S100 is well equipped and designed, with both a USB interface and convenient access to batteries and media when the camera is mounted on a tripod. The included software bundles together a valuable mix of applications, particularly the effective image-stitching software for panorama-mode shots.","Date":"March 26, 2001"}

The Canon S100 destroys this problem.  I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.  The results are superb...both in print and over the computer.The computer interface (I use Windows ME) was a no-brainer.  Absolutely no problems whatsoever with installation or use.Uploading photos to your preferred online printing shop (OFoto, etc.) is simple and straightforward.  The quality of the printed shots is outstanding.  So far my prints have all been 4x6 and the clarity is outstanding.  I'm NOT a professional but I am pretty picky and to my eyes the quality of the S100 prints live up to the very best shots I've ever taken with traditional 35mm cameras.  In fact, the number of \"bad\" shots is substantially less than with the traditional 35mm camera.  Consistency is just outstanding.I've purchased the Viking 64MB memory card (great price here at Amazon) and find that it works very well and that it is plenty fast.Low light shots could be better but I haven't found this to be a limiting issue.Bottom line...buy this camera and prepare to take more quality shots than you've ever taken before.

Thomson","ReviewID":"R1E4THLPYF0AQ6","Overall":"good","Content":"I have to admit, I don't have very much experience with digital cameras prior to this, but I did a TON of research before deciding on this one, based on price, size, battery usage, and picture quality. Before I bought it, I got it as a graduation gift. It is soo cool! Here are some things you should know about the s100:1. The battery usage is pretty good, I've heard a lot of complaints about other cameras. For some reason I always have the LCD on, so I dont know how long they last without that. Buying a second battery is very helpful, and I really recommend it.2. It comes with 3 cool softwares. One is great for organizing your pictures in a \"library\", it does it quick and easily accessible. You can put the pics into folders and name them. From the camera, each picture already has a date on it. Adobe PhotoDeluxe is good at editing, but if you want pro quality, I recommend Adobe Photoshop. It also installs a software for making panoramic photos. The camera makes taking those pictures easy, and the software makes stitching them together even easier. You can stitch together 2 pictures or more (I usuallly do 5 or 6).3. Some people seem to have a few problems with the flash, but I like it. It is really tiny, and hardly noticable, but very strong. It also sends a smaller light out first to decrease red eye. I still get red eye sometimes, but i fix it easily with a kids photo software program.4. I have pretty big fingers, but I havent had much of a problem with the controls. You can do all kinds of things right on the camera, like manual exposure or flash, regular zoom, continuous shooting, deleting and rotating pictures, or making them black and white. All can be done quite easily.5. When I am taking pictures of people at home, I love to plug the camera into the TV so everyone can see the LCD screen. This was a big hit at my graduation party.6. A lot of people will come up and ask you about the camera. Most people are surprised its digital and the features it has. Also, people are really surprised by the photos you print, if you have a good printer.I also got a memory card reader with mine, which downloads pictures really fast and doesnt waste battery power.

If you don't, consider getting a Lexar CF card with USB built in. (I think they call it jump start).This camera is TINY. I carry it in my pocket with my cell phone (Samsung SCH-8500), both fit no problems (though it is a bit bulky).My few complaints: the manual mode is weak (no shutter priority, which makes taking pictures of computer screens potentially interesting), the lens is REALLY SLOW (combined with a light camera makes handheld low-light no-flash shots really hard even without zoom), the zoom is weak (only 2x). Perhaps I was spoiled by best shot selector and a reasonable manual mode on the Nikon Coolpix 950, but I sold mine since it was too big to reasonably carry with me all the time. BTW the tripod mount is not in the focal plane of the camera, so tripod panoramics don't turn out perfectly; not that I care, since I'd never bring this camera out with a tripod (I'm looking into a Oly C-2040 for that)","Date":"January 19, 2001"}

The resolution is better than you could possibly need for viewing on-screen.  For printing you will find it adequate for most needs, though a real photo buff or professional will crave more of the megapixels that equal image quality and the ability to enlarge pictures.  You will want a larger capacity card than the camera ships with; a 64mb card is superb (though I fear myself wanting something larger in the future).  I am waiting to see if I need the additional battery that most people seem to crave.  Get a case to protect the LCD while travelling, but it feels good to have it in your pocket alone when you are careful.  It is so small that you will have little excuse to leave it at home.  I miss the days when I used to take a point-and-shoot 35mm with me everywhere.  I have many pictures from the 80s and early 90s.

This camera is super solid (metal body) and will fit anywhere!  I use it for business with my laptop (PCMCIA slot adapter for the compact flash card-- about $...) and personal (USB  speed).  The camera is easy to use and allows very good picture quality.  The only negative was finding a small case-- most compact cases in  department stores are too big.  I settled on a hip neoprene case made by  CaseLogic for MP3 players. I also added a 32MB memory card which allows  about 50 pictures in the regular 1600x1200 mode.

{"Title":"A Terrifc, Compact easy-to-use Digital Camera","Author":"Colin Ooi","ReviewID":"RSS275NZ8IUY8","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera recently to replace my Sony Mavica digital camera and to use alongside my Canon EOS 300 35mm SLR camera.My initial concerns that the camera would not be compatible with my Pentium III 800 running Windows Millenium Edition were unfounded. I had downloaded the appropriate driver from the canon.com.au website and installed this, rather than the driver was on the Canon CD that came along with the camera. There had been mention only of compatibility with W98 and W2K, so I was relieved to find the WME driver available.Setup was quick and without a hassle. I was able to operate camera, and transfer pictures without having to refer to  the manual at all.This camera is very much an improvement over my previous digital camera. With super fast transfer of pictures by USB, its ultra compact shape and size, retractable lens system, and its 3-point autofocus system, the Canon Ixus has produced numerous images that I will keep.I have found the ZoomBrowser software to be very easy to use, although other reviewers have mentioned their dislike of this particular application. The PC will automatically detect the camera when you switch it on and plug the USB cable in, and will launch the ZoomBrowser for you. You can even transfer pictures from the PC to the camera which comes in handy when you want to bring your CF card to a photo developer to produce prints for selected photos.I bought an extra rechargeable battery to go with it and it turned out to be a good decision. I added a 64 MB Compact flash to the 8 MB one that came with it, as well. The 64 MB card will store 107 1600 X 1200 pictures or over 360 640x480 pictures. I am now on the lookout for a 192 MB card which will easily serve my needs.Overall this camera gets 5 stars from me. It is a true pocket-sized camera with its light-weight portability being a major plus!","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

I've been a Canon afficionado for some years. However, I have found the ELPH series can be difficult to use because of their small size. I would not give this as a gift to someone who might have difficulty seeing the tiny symbols on the camera body, or to someone with large hands who might have trouble adjusting the micro-sized buttons to set the camera. The larger Canons still have the edge over these mini-sizes, especially in quality of photos.","Date":"December 8, 2000"}

{"Title":"Some extra and hopefully useful info.","Author":"Coleman Yee","ReviewID":"R1VNYYL3IDLBWY","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using this camera for a few months now. A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:1. The 3-point AiAF works great in most situations. But for tricky situations, you'll be greatly disappointed as you can't control the focusing point.2. Don't have high hopes for macro mode. Forget about closeup shots of flowers and insects. It just can't focus close enough. Also, you'll have to use the LCD for macro cos the optical viewfinder does not have closeup correction.3. Fleeting moments will remain fleeting moments. The lag between the pressing of the shutter button and the actual picture is very noticable. Common for digital cameras, but if you're used to film cameras, this is something you'd have to get used to (really tough taking sports photography).4. Don't try taking pictures of people at wide-angle, unless you know what you're doing. Zoom it all the way in, or you'll get distorted faces and enemies if you send it to the subjects.5. Just a minor point here. The lettering on the camera body comes off real easy, especially if you subject it to rough usage like I do. Like the ON/OFF button on mine is completely gone, so friends can't figure out how to turn it on (which suits me fine). But the body is really rugged. Subjected mine to a good number of minor knocks, but it's not worrying.6. Last point. Minor for some, major for others. This thing is highly attractive. You'll have to get used to friends drooling in awe. Wait till they see the pictures (provided you're already a decent photographer).","Date":"March 19, 2001"}

It takes great, clear pictures, its small, and its easy to use.But, I did run into a couple of problems...1.  Although it says it on the box once you buy the camera, the amazon.com website failed to mention that transferinng your pictures to your computer via the USB cable works ONLY if you have a pre-installed version of windows 98 or windows 2000 on your computer.  If you have upgraded from a previous version of windows, the USB cable will not work.  That being said, I bought a San Disk card reader and it works great.  It is so convienient that this method is probably better anyway.2.  The battery does not last long at all.  That is what prevented the camera from getting 5 stars.  With the LCD on it only maybe for 40 pictures.  You definitely need a second battery... but you're gonna have to shell out a high price.Even with the problems, i love this camera and probably would buy it again.","Date":"December 29, 2001"}

This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting. The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive. I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures. The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots. I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack. My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be. I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time! Other than that, I love this camera.

As a formerly pro-photographer now home with a 3 year old, I gave up on trying to take quick pictures with my expensive SLR Canon outfit.  The Canon S100 Elph is easy to use, and with moderate computer skills, I had no trouble installing and using software.  This is my first digital camera, so I can't compare it to others.  But, the pictures coming out of my printer certainly compare with traditional media up to about 8X10, where there is falloff unless you use the highest resolution.

I have had some annoying problems with the software on my Windows 98 machine; basically I have to uninstall the driver everytime I disconnect the camera or the computer will look for it, not find it, and crash the next time I restart the machine.

The days of buying film, waiting in anticipation while it develops(more$), and only then seeing the often disapointing results are over!  I waited way too long to go digital, scanning photos,filling boxes with prints that just were a waste of paper, and then along came the elph s-100! My mini-knight in shining stainless steel armor! I really love this camera.  The images are superb. I love the things that I can do with them. The canon zoombrowser software is a snap to organize them. And the thing that I love best is the size. I carry the little guy everywhere! I hook the camera case to my belt and away we go! Inside the small caselogic(sold seperate) I hold the camera, 2 spare memory cards and a backup battery(also seperate items).  Once I realized that this thing was a keeper I purchased the following items and recommend them: small camera case, backup battery, ac/dc power adapter, and at least 1 32mg(or higher)memory card. I also recommend a disk reader. I have the sandisk. It was a little tricky installing the driver but it makes downloads a breeze. This stuff adds up fast and that is the only down side, cost. However, it is up-front cost and believe me it is worth it!  My favorite way of sharing the images is to hook the camera up to my vcr. This turns the tv into the camera monitor and then I can make video photo-albums by recording the images onto a tape! The camera functions are easy to control and the images are great! It is alot of fun to see your pictures on tv, a 21st century slide-show that is easy & fun to do. Of all the ways that I have used this is the most popular with my family & friends.  Of course digital images have so many possibilities. The more you experiment, the more fun it becomes! The only drawback is lack of time for hobbies, and of course hard-disk size. The latter is solved by the many on-line storage sites. My favorite is OFOTO.com. They also offer easy to download software, and competitive prices on developing prints.  In summary if you are sitting on the fence like I was about digital photography, the camera you have been waiting for is here! Its size, ease of use, image quality and rugged construction make this the perfect next step into the future!","Date":"April 11, 2001"}

It's, literally, no bigger than a pack of cigarettes. It'll fit right in your front pocket. But, don't let its size fool you. It appears to be built very rugged -- not nearly all plastic as many cameras in this price range are. I bought the camera just before Christmas and the very first picture I took was shot across a 28-foot living room at night using the built-in flash. The wall on the far end was perfectly exposed. I kept wondering how a flash so small could put out such power. I really haven't had one bad exposure. I just made a trip to Las Vegas and took dozens of snapshots along the strip at night without the flash. Every one turned out great. I shoot mostly on medium resolution and a 64mb flash card is about all you need -- unless you'll be gone for weeks. The only annoyance: somehow, the optical viewfinder was not installed perfectly level (with the digital viewfinder), but the Canon service folks took care of that. This really is a GREAT camera -- same superb quality as my old 1981 Canon AE-1 Program which is still my favorite 35mm.... The Elph is a winner. Go for it!","Date":"April 17, 2002"}

Which, ofcourse, means the better quality pictures you want to take, the morestorage space you need. I recommend a 32M, or better, Compact Flashcard...  2)Buy an extra battery.  The batter will last around 70 or sopictures using a flash, with the LCD turned off, but if you plan ongoing on vacation, you will definitly need one.  3)Image quality isinconsistent.  This could be my fault, but under the camera automaticsetting, some pictures come out way too dark, red, or blurry.  This isspecially true when taking pictures indoors.  But daylight outdoorpictures are truely beautiful.  4) You need to hold the camera verysteady when taking pictures due to its small size.

I bought a 48Mb memory card which I have never used entirely, in a whole weekend or 4 days, which is long enough to download the pictures at home (279) lowest qualityI also bought an AC/DC conector which worked perfectly when taking pictures for my e-commerce business, (. . . ) and my thesis with pacients and their development of their therapy I've re-touched the pictures in photoshop and these tools are really saving me LOADS of money.The software is some how ineficient in the sence of re-naming pictures.

{"Title":"Very Worth Your Consdieration","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1JC5YUESKK98C","Overall":"good","Content":"***Confessions of an Anti-Camera man***Up to the moment I bought this camera, I have been very indifferent towards taking any photos. Photography was too analog for me in this digital age. Make no mistake, I am in mechanical engineering, but to me, those 35mm camera was too tedious  in terms of usage. You could not see how you took the picture on the spot, or that you had to use all of the film to get the prints.My attitude towards taking photos changed when I saw my dad's Nikon Coolpix 800 half a year ago. All of my problems with conventional cameras were solved when I saw the pictures on the small but very sharp LCD. Since then, my quest to find a digital camera began. After all the considerations from sorting through countless reviews, I chose Canon Powershot S100 for the following reasons.1. It is very light and compact. Besides my cell phone, slim and  light Ericsson T28, and Palm V, this camera is so compact  that you worry about sitting on it without realizing that  you have it inside your pocket. 2. The quality is very satisfying for an amateur photographer  like me. Also, the functions included in this camera  is really worth the price. I use the Black and White  option with gusto. 3. You don't have to buy films... for ever! Of course,  you have to have other kinds of data medium like the  flash card, but having photos in forms of graphic files  makes things so easier in this world of computers and  the internet.  In addition, places like Kinko's are now having machines  that lets you make fine prints from your digital camera.However, there are some problems. 1. Because the camera's power consumption is very high, you are  forced to buy an AC adapter or extra batteries. 2. Also, the 8MB flash card included with the camera is toooo  puny. I had to buy a bigger one. 3. The software that is included is not that good. But hey,  the Japanese are excellent in hardware, not that good  in terms of software(not just yet).  4. Also, it took me some frustrating moments to install the  USB driver... And I thought I was frequent with computers for  the past 16 years!  (P.S. To dear Craig; get someone who is good at computers  and have the person install the driver for you. It was hair  raising for me also) 5. You need sufficient light source in order to take a good  picture.... But again, this applies to MANY digital cameras  out there. My advice; believe in the power of the sun.Uhmmm... and besides these five little complaints, this camera rocks. My, I can write far more complements on this camera on and on. Also, the price; it is one of the most affordable and attention-grabbing cameras out there(actually, S100 captures not only photos but attention of other people as well).Until I get serious about photography, this camera will be 'camera' that I will cherish for a veryyyy long time to come, and I hope that you will, too.","Date":"February 10, 2001"}

I also bought the Canon case for it which I did not care for. Canon just gave a press release which states they are going to manufacture the Canon Digital Elph PS300. Although still 2.1 Million Mega Pixels, it will have an optical 3x zoom lens ( the PS100 is 2X ), more efficient use of memory with 9 different resolution ( I believe the PS100 has three ) better battery usage.. and the biggest difference is it will allow you to take video with sound! Maybe worth the wait.","Date":"March 9, 2001"}
{"Title":"One of the better *compact* cameras for beginners","Author":"Dani Nymeyer","ReviewID":"R2IW2TGDPWTUW6","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!  The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).However, I do have a few things to complain about...First off, the battery.  This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.  Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.  The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.  Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!  Very wrong.  The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.  Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.The flash is very weak.  Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.  The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.  To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.  The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.These are all the flaws I found in the camera, it's not my first choice in cameras, I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.  If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.","Date":"December 22, 2004"}
{"Title":"Small, small, small, I love it!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R248IO79FJM50P","Overall":"good","Content":"I adore this camera.  My #1 priority was to get a digital camera that was small enough so I could take it EVERYWHERE.  I would rather have dozens of pictures of pretty good quality than one perfect terapizel resolution shot from the one occasion a year that I might actually remember to lug a full-sized camera along!This camera is small and light and rides in my purse all the time.  On the highest quality setting in good lighting it makes very acceptable prints.  For pictures taken in lower lighting outside the reach of the flash, you can definitely see the prints starting to get grainier.  If you don't make prints at all but keep your pictures on a computer, you'll probably be perfectly happy with the resolution.I did get a 64MB card in addition to the 8MB card the camera came with; you might also want to consider a second battery since using the flash a lot (like at indoor family gatherings) can quickly exhaust the poor thing.  (It recharges pretty quickly though.)Overall, I've been delighted with this camera's convenience, pleased with the prints, and never had a moment's trouble with it in the year I've had it.  A very satisfying purchase.","Date":"November 23, 2002"}

I would recommend this camera unequivocally!The camera's resolution is an optimum balance between getting sharp pictures and not taking up a great deal of memory on your harddrive - 2.11 megapixels is plenty.You'll definitely need another CF card - get a 128 MB CompactFlash Card which will take about 150 pictures easily!  I got a SanDisk 128 MB CF Card.You *may* want to get an extra battery.  If you turn the LCD display OFF while taking pictures, you don't even need an extra battery.  I got one just for kicks - it's always reassuring to have a spare battery you can reach out for when the camera's battery is running low.I also bought the SanDisk CF Reader.  I haven't used it yet since Windows NT 4.0 doesn't have USB Support.  Guess I'll have to wait for my new computer to arrive before using it.  I have heard that it transfers images quickly and conviniently (more so than attaching the camera itself).  Not to mention, the camera's battery will not drain.Summary:  Get this camera!  For the price they have advertised here, it is a fabulous buy.  It's incredibly easy to use (very intuitive design).  As for accessories, a bigger CF Card (to meet your needs) is a must - amazon has pretty good prices on these cards as well.  The extra battery and CF reader will provide a great deal of convinience.You'll be surprised at the # of pictures you'll take with this little thing -- after all, you can always erase the bad images :)","Date":"December 15, 2001"}

{"Title":"Canon Digital Elph","Author":"David Hurwitz \"DaveH\"","ReviewID":"RM6ZFG2QRXMI","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had a Canon Digital Elph for several months and am thrilled with the camera.  While it has its limitations - lack of a good zoom, anemic flash and hard-to-see viewfinder, it takes great pictures and is exceptionally easy to tote around.  I have not used the highest resolution mode and have been quite satisfied with 8X10 prints printed on my HP 890 or sent to Ofoto.  The panorama mode can produce spectacular results and by the way is an easy way around the limitations of the camera's 2.1 megapixel resolution.  If you play around with the size of your panoramas, you  can print pictures larger than 8X10 that will be as sharp as your 8X10's.  If you don't have a large format printer, use a printing service for that special photo.  I have been blown away by the instant feedback I get from a digital camera and the Elph has made photography a lot more fun.  Often, it's the only camera I carry, but I still lug around an APS SLR with a big zoom when I'm doing serious photography.  I have been rather surprised how well some hand-held night shots come out.  I've gotten pictures at dusk that are reasonably sharp and show much more detail than I would expect from the camera's ISO 100 rating.  It is essential to have a second battery as your battery will always run out when you need it.  I use Lexar CF cards, they come with a USB cable and transfer pictures 3x faster than the camera.  Set the camera in \"manual\" mode, which is still basically automatic, as it allows you to choose all the flash modes available.  In addition, set the camera to remember the last settings or you will have to put it into manual mode each time you turn it on.  Unlike a lot of digital cameras on the market, the Elph is easy to use and carry and feels like a camera.  Its menus are a little complex but people who don't find features that are there and complain about difficulty of use just haven't studied the manual.  I have recommended the camera to my friends on this basis:  in 5 years it will be obsolete but it will still fit in your pocket and you will still be using it for snapshots.","Date":"February 10, 2001"}

{"Title":"Durable but not indestructable","Author":"Buddie & Arthur","ReviewID":"R2FXFDIL1E3M5O","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this camera virtually since it was introduced to the market and I am a definite fan.  Despite using it frequently it has withstood the test of time and use and the pictures that it takes are more than suitable for my needs.  I post pictures at much reduced resolution and they still look great and those that I have chosen to print look great even at 8\"x10\".The only structural flaw that I've experienced is that the door to the CF bay broke but for $$$ I was able to contact the Canon Service Center (through their website at ...) and order the replacement part shipped directly to my door.  Installing it involved removing the piece attached to the lanyard with a mini-screwdriver, but all in all the fix took 5 minutes.  Though the newer cameras have corrected this structural flaw (and others), I have found this camera to be extremely durable.This camera also works extremely well underwater if you purchase the waterproof case.  The case is extremely bulky, but for what you get by being able to take it underwater, the bulk is more than worth it!All in all, this is a great camera!","Date":"November 15, 2002"}

The camera was a pleasent surprise on Christmas morning.  The pictures are very clear and it hooks up very easily to the TV and our computer.  I'm glad I purchased the extra picture disc which had been recommended also. My only recomendation would be to purchase a spare battery as the one with the camera runs out quickly.  It does recharge very fast.  This is a great camera and I would recommend buying it to everyone.","Date":"January 2, 2002"}

{"Title":"This camera really changed things around our house","Author":"James B. Rasmus","ReviewID":"R2Y5Q9W3PCTBB7","Overall":"good","Content":"With 3 kids, ages 3 mo, 5 yrs and 8 yrs we are really on the go.  We found that with each new birth, we had less and less time to tote the SLR and lenses around and take, process, wait, and pick up photos.  This thing fits in your shirt pocket so it goes everywhere and we are able to save the 3/36 great photos and delete the rest.  Highpoints of the product in my opinion are: the size, the size, the size, the great optics, and the bundled software.  Things that could really turn this into a dream machine in future models of the same size would be: better battery life, 4.4 Mpix, slighty more intuitive onboard software/os.  Overall this is great product!","Date":"August 16, 2001"}
{"Title":"I wanted to love this camera","Author":"Jonathan C","ReviewID":"R25TX8ZS44FEY8","Overall":"good","Content":"In the next 8 hours I have to decide if I am going to return my elph.  And I am stumped, here's why:Inconsistent quality control -I bought one that had a big green dot in the middle of the LCD screen so I returned it. The new one I bought has a big problem with white balancing - caucasian skin tones turn yellow brown indoors with the flash, and black shapes become two dimensional in dim light. In addition - the LCD does not work in dim light.But on the other hand -Size- I have taken more pictures in the last 29 days than in the last 6 months. Wow Factor - everyone at every party loves to play with it Digital Convenience - not having to worry about film, you can shoot away at things you never would waste development cost on.So do I return it and pay 200 more for a Fuji 40i? Or do I wait a year for the next generation and continue to shoot on film.You decide.","Date":"December 12, 2000"}

I have waited for some time before getting into the digital craze and I am glad I did. However, the accessories are not yet available.

{"Title":"Extremely cool.","Author":"R. Duncan","ReviewID":"R3VA39A7PLEC7Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned several digital cameras but this is by far my favorite. It's so tiny that I take it everyplace. Easy to  use, elegant design, battery life is great. USB interface is a huge improvement in speed and reliability over the serial interface I had on my previous camera (Olympus). The only thing that really annoys me about this camera is the location of the on/off button. Too many times I've hit it by accident instead of the shutter button when I was in a hurry, and turned off the camera instead of getting my picture!","Date":"March 22, 2001"}
{"Title":"great balance of size and quality - the straight story","Author":"Frostystar \"frostystar\"","ReviewID":"R2FEQ0YFM5MYQA","Overall":"good","Content":"this small camera takes terrific pictures.  I have found the best results are outdoor shots.  the flash indoors works well on close subjects.  things to know:battery life is good if you keep the lcd off.  take pictures through the viewfinder.  use the lcd sparingly for quick reviews of what you've taken - you should by another battery and keep it charged as a standby.go out and by a 128 MB flash card - they've gotten pretty cheap and one will hold plenty of shots.i like using a USB flash card reader to transfer shots - so easy and you don't have to mess with the camera and run the batteries down, etc.avoid the optional Canon bag - awkward getting the camera in and out ...- the velcro closure is lame. Eagle Creek makes a great small camera bag.  it's black, cushioned, has an elastic opening with an ample shoulder strap and neat little pocket that can accomodate your extra battery and flash card(s) - highly recommended.if you're looking for a good quality digital camera and compactness is a major criteria, you're search may be over.  I would look at other reviews of similar form factor cameras by Canon as I purchased this late last summer and they may have an improved version at the same pricepoint.  snap on!","Date":"May 2, 2002"}
{"Title":"Small, light, robust and great pictures for the price.","Author":"Mr. James Mcclenahan","ReviewID":"R1ES5AYFDKNABW","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned a Powershot S100 ( known in Europe as the Canon Digital Ixus ) for a year. It does not provide the same flexibility as a decent SLR but it can and does produce very good photos.Because it is so small and light it can be taken virtually anywhere, -  great for holidays, sporting events, parties.A high capacity compact flash card is an essential extra - I have purchased a 32mb and a 64mb. One word of warning, the USB connection for downloading will not work with Windows 95.","Date":"January 2, 2002"}
