{"Title":"pics a little dark,","Author":"bored99","ReviewID":"R8ISICYY1UWNG","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures. The size is tiny, which I love. We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging). Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 \"adjust levels\" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.Speaking of software, the program that came with the camera 2 years ago was horrible, but they've since upgraded to a program that's decent which you can download from the Canon website (and likely they provide the latest software with current purchases--I'm not sure).The normal zoom works well, but when you get into the \"digital zoom,\" everything gets fuzzy--both the viewscreen and the actual pictures are big blurs. So I just don't use that feature.Overall, it's a decent buy.","Date":"July 20, 2002"}

It is the size of a Credit Card and about 1.5 inches thick.  Our family loves it.  The camera takes excellent pictures wich are great for the internet, e-mail, and printing.  It is very easy to use and come with the basic functions any novice like me will ever need to use.  The camera functions well in just about any environment, and its flash will even take a perfect picture in total darkness (limited distance).  I really wanted a full function camera, with all the bells and whistles that I probably would never use, and I was looking into the the 3 or 4 megapixel cameras.  After much shopping around, and comparing price and values, I purchased this one and couldn't be happier.  I would strongly recommend this camera.  My only fear is I will misplace it because it is so small.","Date":"May 25, 2002"}

Shamroski \"jshamroski@yahoo.com\"","ReviewID":"R13ZSHJ8ZM4BK2","Overall":"good","Content":"I just got the camera, charged up the battery and went out shooting. The pictures look great. The default resolution for the camera in full auto mode (point & shoot) is 1600x1200 Fine, to get the Super Fine mode you have to go into manual mode - but even then it is very simple to shoot.I see a difference between the Fine & Super Fine modes, but I have printed 8x10 in both and am pleased with the results.My biggest complaint is the size of the memory card included with the camera, only 8mb - this will only store 4 pictures at max resolution in Super Fine mode. Luckily prices on Compact Flash cards are cheaper now (128mb for ($$$)). I have also found 3rd party batteries (...)for half the cost of the Canon battery.The pocket size charger makes traveling with it very simple, no cords needed to charge.Other - I wish the AC Adapter was a little cheaper, at ($$$)I think it is a little out of line.Bottom line, buy a camera from camera company and you get a good camera.

{"Title":"Best Christmas Present ever!","Author":"Marc C. Bush \"mc_bush\"","ReviewID":"R15ABY7RXYBNPZ","Overall":"good","Content":"OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get. Thank you Santa!It's been nearly a year of fun use of this little darlin', and there's no stopping me. The picture quality is excellent, and the camera itself is sure to become a classic - what with the real aluminum shell, and tiny size, this camera is packed with cachet. Nice thing is that it's also easy to use, and the results are remarkable.During our company softball tournament in which my boss and I were playing, I handed this to one of my friends to take pictures, and my boss handed another his \"best in class\" Olympus 4 mega-pixel. The results - the Olympus was a little sharper, and had a bigger telephoto, but the users all showed a preference to own the Canon.Here's the scoop - Pixels aren't everything. There are several other variables in getting a great picture. Of course there's the aesthetic of the photographer which can't be quantified, but on the technical side there are also others. Many tend to focus on numbers when buying equipment - what's the resolution - how many watts - what's the horsepower. But can you really rate things this way? Is a BMW Z3 the most powerful car or is it sufficiently powered? How well it corners may be a better metric. The S100 may not be the most powerful in terms of resolution or zooming capabilities, but it sure looks and handles great!On the technical side - the lens is excellent. I suspect that it's pushing the resolving power limit for such a small piece of glass. If you remember from your Physics classes the theoretical ultimate resolving power of a lens is directly proportional to it's diameter. With such a small diameter, one can only reach a certain limit. From examining the results up close one can see that the resolving power of the lens is the limiting factor in the overall resolution. Details break up in the image before the pixels become evident. All this to say that the only way to make the picture sharper would be to make the lens wider which would scale the whole camera bigger, and who would want that?The camera does an excellent job focusing, determining the correct exposure, and balancing colors - three other aspects to good image quality - other than simple \"pixel count\". I've made prints from shutterfly.com up to 5x7 so far, and nobody would be able to tell that these were not shot with 35mm - and a full size SLR at that.OK now for the drawbacks. Nothing is perfect. The main gripe I have is the amount of \"shutter lag\". That is, the amount of time it can take between pressing the shutter button and the camera firing. I suspect that most of this delay is required to get such fine results. Canon calls it AiAF. It basically takes a sample picture prior to the real one and sets the focus, exposure, flash, and white balance accordingly. Nice thing is that it's reading all this stuff from the same CCD sensor that will eventually give you the image - not some little sensor away from the lens that point and shoot film cameras require. But it does cause about a 0.5 second delay - just long enough to loose the moment. But with some practice it's not difficult to pre-focus by pressing halfway down - then press the rest of the way down when ready to fire.I could go on and on about this little jewel - cool stuff - with just a few minor issues - the shutter lag being by far the worst.Right now I see that Amazon has a great deal on it. Great deal! They must have bought up a bunch of these for this price. It has been discontinued and replaced with the S110. The only differences I can see is that the S110 has a minor video mode and 2MB of built in Flash memory so you can take a picture or two without a memory card in it - no big deal. I just keep the 8MB card that comes with it as a spare, after all you are going to go out and get at least a 64MB card to go with it any way aren't you? If you want to pay extra, get the S300 which has a 3X zoom instead of the 2X on this one.Enjoy and happy holidays!","Date":"November 19, 2001"}

An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.  Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.  BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.I found the Canon on closeout at Compusa for a crazy low price. Should have bought every one they had, but lacking the bucks, I picked up one, intending to play with it for a day or two and then sell it off at Ebay for a nice profit.I'm still using it 4 months later.  I can't bring myself to sell it.  I've never opened the included 8mb CF card as it's stupid for Canon to even include a card if they're going to put one in that small,  it won't hold the equivilent of a roll of film.  There are lots of sellers of CF cards now priced right. I put a 128mb chip in that cost me less than $50.I've read some complaints about the battery.  I don't think those folks know what they are talking about.  As long as you are not messing around too much reviewing photos,  the included battery will last you all day. If not,  get a converter and plug your battery in your car for a quick recharge. No big deal.The lens is a bit slow,  and it really doesn't have the reach I'd like,  but that's fixable.  (...) buy an adapter and one of his monocular lens add ons. Works very well, but it's a bit of a pain to focus. Once you figure out how it all works together you can get photos of birds in the tops of trees with no trouble. Better buy a little tri-pod though.The best photos are taken by the camera you have at the time you need to take the photo. This camera and the others in it's line are pocketable and built to be hauled around. This is the camera that will take the photo you would have missed! The only reason I put this camera at 4 stars is the little 8mb cf card that comes with it. If they'd put a 32, I'd given 5 stars.","Date":"November 18, 2001"}

{"Title":"Best birthday present ever!!!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R13O5JU6I3VNBO","Overall":"good","Content":"My boyfriend bought this for me for my birthday last month--yes he thinks I'm special.  The only digital camera I had ever used was a Kodak with limited battery life that my brother has.  In the middle of a boat ride in AZ it died.  But I've had nothing but fun since I got this camera.  I spent the first few days running around snapping pictures of friends to send to a pal in AK via e-mail.  The software included makes downloading to your computer a no brainer, and you can compress photos and send them to disk or via e-mail instantly.The memory card that comes with it is kinda cute, but I recommend ditching it for a larger one--8MB just isn't enough.  My guy gave me a 48MB compact flash card, and with the photo quality set at fine/large it still holds about 80 images.The camera's size makes it a blast to handle; it will fit in your pocket or one of the riddiculously small cases I found at Ritz Camera.  I think what I love most about it is that it takes the guesswork out of taking pictures.  I've always been a pocket camera type of girl, and would leave film sitting around on shelves and in my camera until I didn't know what was on the rolls anymore.  I'd develop picures and say, \"Oh look, it's London from last spring!\"  But now I can view my photos as I take them, and can ditch the stinkers.All in all, I believe it's a worthwhile investment despite the price, but it's even better if you can get someone to buy it for you!","Date":"May 1, 2001"}
{"Title":"The new model is larger","Author":"Amazon Customer \"tholden1\"","ReviewID":"R119M1KK20TN0J","Overall":"good","Content":"The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.  The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.  It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a \"Normal\" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.  The price is $... more.In my opinion the 3X zoom is nice but it is not worth $.. more and a large increase in size.  I also cannot see how such limited movie making capabilities would be useful.  I therefore bought the S....The camera takes very good pictures.  The flash has a tendency to cause a slight blue cast on some things indoors.  The low-light capabilities are not that great but then I think they are as good as my previous Minolta Vectis APS point-and-shoot (which by the way has a 76mm zoom compared to the S100s 70mm, not much different).  The ability to preview shots after taking them is great.  Outdoor shots are where this camera really shines.  They are great!  Overall, I think it takes pictures just as good if not better than my old Minolta APS.  It fits easily in my jeans pocket.  The battery life is not bad.  Get a second battery if you are going to use it on trips.I deducted a star for the following reasons:  they should have either not included a compactflash card and reduced the price or included a larger compactflash card than 8mb, they should have a leather case available in the US like they do in Canada and Europe, I would have preferred a pop-up flash like they do on some of their Elphs, I would have preferred more standard batteries but I understand why they went with the proprietary one, I would prefer the ability to change image capture resolution without having to switch into manual mode.Overall this is a great camera.  Well worth the price.  It is going to replace my Minolta Vectis APS 25.  I am very impressed with the pictures I have taken with it so far (except for maybe some of the indoor with flash shots).  Very easy to use.  Well recommended.","Date":"March 13, 2001"}

{"Title":"Very handy second camera","Author":"contentgrrl","ReviewID":"R2GZ4KLNZNZ2A0","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it.First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.  I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.  The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.  The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder. If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.  They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.  When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.  Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.  It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.  Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture. By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.","Date":"July 21, 2003"}

But then not too long after I purchased this camera, I \"occasionally\" can not turn the camera off:  that is,  when I press the off button, the zoom len would not contract.  I have to use brute force to push the len in.  I also have a problem with blurred images every now and then.  After I contacted the Canon support person, they told me that the len is defective and I have to send in for repair.  BTW,  I have the camera for a grand total of six months and I have only used it for 5 occasions.Another problem with this camera is that it does not fair very well if the lighting is not sufficent, even with the built in flash.  If you use automatic mode and if you want to take outdoor night view, be prepared that you might not get what you want.One thing I can say positive about this camera, besides the obvious ultra light weight advantage, is that its software (image viewer) is fairly easy to use.

{"Title":"Great all around digicam, and it's truly Mac compatible!","Author":"A. Tubesing","ReviewID":"RZ7YP19VZGUBD","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this camera for about six months now.  As a serious ammateur photographer for 15 years, I swore that I would still use my film camera for some things, but I haven't touched it.  I take this Sony everywhere.  This camera is a great all-around digital camera.  It is compact, easy to use, the menus and controls are easily understood, and it takes great pictures.  I was thinking about getting the S30 without the video feature instead, but I am very glad I got the video.  I really like the video feature and I use it a lot.  Below are a few major points you should consider about this camera.  First of all, no other digital camera brand I have seen comes anywhere close to the lens quality of the Sonys.  The marco (close-up) setting allows you to take a picture from literally a half inch away from the subject.  Most other digital cameras with macro settings let you get as close as a couple feet.  This means that when you can get, at closest, a full-frame picture of your whole hand with other digicams, the sony lets you zoom all the way in to just a fingernail.  Incidentally this camera also has a text-capture mode which I have used quite successfully for taking pictures of blueprints and other documents.  These kinds of images show up nicely on the computer screen.  Secondly, This camera is fully mac-compatible.  It comes with a USB cable and software that actually does work on the Mac.  When you connect the camera to the cable, it shows up on the desktop just like a drive.  The only problem I have had is when reading files right off the disc - sometimes it thinks there's a problem with the drive.  If you first transfer them to your hard drive and then view them there's no problem.   Some rules of thumb for file size:  A high resolution pic (1600x1200) typically takes about 900k, so I figure about one meg each.  The medium res (1024x768) is about 300k per pic, so I figure about three pics per meg.  These are still pretty high resolution pictures.  The lowest res (640x480) pics take about 100k each (a nice size for emailing).  That's about 10 per meg.  On video mode, the high res (320x240) takes about 100k per second, so about 10 sec of video per meg.  The low res video mode (160x112) does about 40 sec per meg.  So with the 4 mb memory stick that comes with the camera you can get about 4 or 5 high res pics, 15 med res pics, 40 low res pics, 40 sec high res video, or 160 sec low res video.  So in summary, get more memory.  I bought two 64 mb cards and they lasted a whole 4-day vacation, and I am pretty snap-happy.  The one problem that I have to complain about is that there is about a one-second delay between pushing the shutter button and the actual capture of the image.  (And I am not talking about the  wait time for writing the file, I am talking about the actual moment of the photograph)  This means that if you are taking pictures of subjects in motion you will have to anticipate the moment and push the button a second early.  If you take a lot of action shots, this camera will proove frustrating.  Often a critical moment will have passed by the time the camera actually takes the picture.  Baby pics, wedding dance pictures, sports shots, all of these are very hard to do with this camera.  For regular static subjects this is not a problem, but for objects in motion this camera is difficult.  All in all I highly reccommend this camera.  Happy shopping.","Date":"December 2, 2000"}
{"Title":"GREAT Camera with TWO minor drawbacks","Author":"Keith","ReviewID":"R7MSQ7FH9KCSY","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera. I origionally intended to purchase the Mavica 90 however when I found the Cybershot, I fell in love with the SIZE and the 2.1 megapixel. The battery life on this camera is fantastic, 2 1/2 hours. The batteries and memory sticks interchange with most of Sony's newer model video cameras. The flash works great in TOTAL darkness up to about 5 feet, after that, it's not much good. In low light, the flash works great. One fantastic feature is the screen, it is clear, sharp and when not in use, turns inward so it is protected from getting scratched ect., a definate PLUS! The screen is some what dark when shooting in low light but you can take your shot and look at it right away in \"play\" mode to see how the shot came out. For me, a minor inconvenience when shooting in LOW LIGHT. The controls are easy to figure out and after playing with them for about 15 minuites, I was ready to go. The video mode will record up to 60 seconds and the sound is really good, given the size of this little baby. Now for the few MINOR drawbacks. First, the 4 meg memory stick supplied with the camera is a joke. Plan on getting at least an 8 meg but I would suggest no less than a 32 meg. Second drawback is the Memory stick/Floppy Disk adaptor. When I purchased it, I was told it worked just like the Mavica - it DOES NOT. Without the software, the adaptor does not work, so if you plan on popping it into a friends computer to look at your pics (Like the Mavica), forget it, unless you carry the software disk around with you. All in all though, this is a great little camera. Smaller, higher pixels and cheaper in price than the Mavica. It performs as advertised by Sony and I was not disappointed. One suggestion, look at the sony starter kit, it includes a carry case, 8 meg memory stick and extra battery, well worth the money in my opinion. If you do get it, I would place a piece of foam in the bottom of the carry case to better padd the camera. Bottom line, if you have been looking at the Mavica's, look at the Cybershot 50 before you make your purchase. If you can do without throwing the floppy disk format into anyone's computer then the cybershot is better, smaller and lighter. For me, it was a minor trade off. EVERY person I have showed this camera to now wants one !","Date":"November 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Amazing little digital camera","Author":"David J. Huber \"Addicted to books!\"","ReviewID":"R3H9CMGKTC73TJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought one of these about 6 weeks ago as I write this, and have fired a couple hundred pictures, and a couple of short videos through it.  Wonderful! It takes great pictures, and the videos (with built-in  microphone) are pretty cool, too. While the controls seemed a little  unwieldy at first, once I pulled out the manual, I needed less than an hour  to go through the options and see how everything works, which isn't too bad  of a learning curve at all. The LCD viewer is great - I can edit and delete  images while shooting, thus saving some precious memory stick space.  I  have appreciated that the LCD viewscreen can also be swiveled around  laterally and vertically, even to point forward, so I can take a picture of  myself and, at the same time, see myself in the viewfinder.  Brilliant! The  flash does a great job of illuminating scenes.  The camera also offers  ability to adjust for white based on indoor, outdoor, or \"other\"  conditions (sounds dumb, I know, to have \"other\", but trust me,  it makes sense).  This is my first USB peripheral, and I have to say I am  impressed - I can pull down a full 32MB memory stick pretty darn quick, and  it's really nice being able to plug the USB port in *while the computer is  on*, and immediately use it without any software hassles. I have to admit  to a certain awe at Microsoft for actually pulling it off with win98.  You  can use the software that comes with the camera, but I have not, since you  will find better image handling, organizing, and altering software as  freeware, shareware, or expensive (like photoshop) professional  stuff.Another super aspect of this camera is the battery - it is  removable, but it is rechargable, and the camera comes with a DC-in jack  and it's own external power supply, so you can plug the camera into the  wall, and recharge that battery for another 2.0-2.5 hours of use.  No more  buying scads and scads of Earth-killing AAs. This is such a simple built-in  to add, and such a highly useful extra, I really have to question why every  digitial camera doesn't do this.On the downside, the viewfinder is very,  very difficult to see when outside; sometimes impossible to see.  And, of  course, please realize that this camera is a point-and-shoot (albeit a  functional one), so changing lenses is *not* an option, nor is having much  control over f-stop or shutter speed - you will have some control, but the  f-stop and shutter speed ranges are not are not what you might be used to.  I also think that, overall, its senstivity to white is not as good as it  should be - my whites tend to end up a bit grey; not much, but a bit.  But  I have to admit I dont know if that's the camera, or a problem with the  really hazy NYC days we've had and/or from shooting inside in rooms with a  mix of flourescent and incandescent lighting.Overall, I am impressed  with this camera, I'm very glad I bought it (and not a different one), and  while it is not 3 megapixels, unless you plan to make large prints of your  images, the resolution on this camera is far higher than you need for  web-image making, and high enough for anything else. It's small, easy to  carry, easy to use, easy to download, and easy to recharge. For the money,  this is, in my opinion, your best deal for a non-professional 2 megapixel  digital camera.","Date":"August 6, 2000"}

Most purchasers of 35 mm point and shoot cameras expect to get a soft case when they buy their camera. Not so with the Sony. The 4MB Memory Stick that comes with the camera is essentially useless, unless the only planned use for the camera is to record low resolution images. Of course, if this were the case, there would be no rationale for buying a 2.1 megapixel camera. Expect to tack at least $100 to the price to buy the \"necessary extras.\"The camera is great fun. It's compact and easy to hold and use. The lithium ion battery charges quickly (full charge in about 2 hours) and provides sufficient power for two days or more of heavy use. The user interface is fairly intuitive and the controls are easy to use. There are several useful features (e.g. adjustable flash intensity). It's easy to get started right away, and it seems to take good pictures under a wide range of lighting conditions.The LCD viewing screen is wonderful. It is clear and bright. The lack of an optical viewfinder, though, is a problem. The LCD is tough to see in bright sunlight (though screen brightness is adjustable). Also, you can't see your subject if you are shooting at night.We've just started experimenting with the image processing software provided for the PC. It's not the easiest nor most intuitive application we have encountered and there is no accompanying  written documentation.Overall, we're happy with the purchase and (based on past volume of use of our point and shoot 35 mm camera) expect to take a lot of digital snapshots.","Date":"December 3, 2000"}
{"Title":"Sony Comes Through","Author":"R. Williams","ReviewID":"R3KLTU63IHHLHU","Overall":"good","Content":"The Sony DSC-S50 may not be the cheapest digital camera you can buy, but it certainly has to be one of the best. The USB port makes loading your pictures on a computer really easy. The controls and menu layout are similar to the Mavica, so if you have used that camera then you already know how the menu system on this one works. The small size and storage capacity are what sold me on this camera. As noted in some other reviews, a viewfinder would be nice, because if you are taking pictures outside, it can be difficult at times to see the image on the flip-up screen. But those are about the only drawbacks to this camera I can think of. I have taken most of my pictures at the lowest resolution, and even then, they are still EXCELLENT pictures. I even posted a picture of a book cover on ebay, and you could read every word that was printed on the book cover. I used the Macro mode and it worked great. I have used a Kodak and Mavica (not owned) in the past, and found the Kodak to be OK, but it isn't in the same league with SONY. I also have to give AMAZON a plug here too. They gave me great service, shipping costs were reasonable, and you save at least $50 or so compared to a typical retailer. This camera comes with a 4mb Memory Stick and I bought a 16mb for additional storage capacity, and I would definitely recommend getting at least that. They are a little pricey right now, but I'm betting the price will drop in the future. Overall, this is a great camera and you won't be disappointed if you buy it. Don't waste your money on off-brands.","Date":"September 22, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nice point and shoot with a few compromises","Author":"\"a_mom\"","ReviewID":"R26Q6X2N93VYAV","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the S50 as a replacement to my traditional 35mm point and  shoot camera.  For the most part it does a good job.  As others have  mentioned, the LCD is quite difficult (if not impossible) to see in bright  sunlight or dark situations.  The red eye reduction does an adequate job,  but I still get a lot of red eye.  The most annoying thing for me is the  shutter delay.  Even without the flash, the delay is quite disconcerting.  The time the shutter needs to be held to take a photo takes some  adjustment.  If you plan to take action shots or shots of children (who  tend to move constantly) getting the shot you want is nearly impossible.  If you use the flash in red eye reduction mode, the delay is quite long.  Since the camera is digital, it's not as disturbing when I  \"waste\" a shot, but I do get frustrated missing a shot I want  because the of the shutter delay.  However, as with an electronic device  there's a learning curve.  Once you get used to the specifics of the S50,  it's a good camera.  The 4MB memory stick is surprisingly adequate, but  I still recommend an additional 16MB or 32MB stick.  The menu structure is  intuitive, as are the controls.  The layout of the controls on the camera  are well placed, too.  The interface to Windows 98 is seemless.  The  included software has its limitations.  Rotating images yields a  disapointing loss in quality.  It's adequate for simple webpage use, but  for any serious editting there are far better packages.  The S50 is a  good replacement for my old point and shoot, but I still use my traditional  35mm for action shots.","Date":"September 8, 2000"}

Better than any that I have seen thus far on the market.  Of course, you do pay a hefty price for such quality (and by this I simply mean price in dollars).  In this particular model, you get up to 2.1 megapixel resolution, which allows for still shots up to 1600 x 1200 (keep in mind, that most people view web pages at 800 x 600, so this is quite large).  The unit ships with a dismal 4 MB of memory, which can only store appx. 4 pictures of the highest resolution.  I would recommend an upgrade to 8 or 16 MB of memory, via Memory Sticks.  Other than that, the product is great, includes USB connectivity for speedy transfers of images, and even allows for full motion video (assuming the memory is available).  As a side note, please use extra caution when touching the screen.  The unit has a special Liquid Crystal display, which does a great job at displaying the images, but is easily susceptable to dust and fingerprints.

The CyberShot DCS-S50 not only takes excellent pictures on  it own, but is an excellent companion to this digital camcorder.  The  memory sticks are interchangeable between the Camcorder and the CyberShot.  Since the DSC-S50 has higher resolution capability I can take my still  images stored on the Memory Stick from the camcorder and increase their  resolution with the CyberShot without having to first download them to my  PC.  (keep in mind that your Sony Memory Stick must have enough space to  add these higher resolution images, also remember, high res. means higher  memory consumption) These two products also share the same rechargeable  battery pack, lens size (.37mm), memory sticks and recharger.  Since my  earlier camcorder purchase, I have aquired more Memory Sticks and after  market zoom and wide angle lens.  All of these devices are  interchangeable.The main reason that I didn't go ahead and purchase the  DCS-S70 (3.3 Megapixel) was the incompatibilty between lens and sizes.  This DCS-S50 (2.1 Megapixel) made a lot more sense once you weighed in the  interchangeability factor.I am pleased that this manufacturer decided to  maintain this compatability an allow me to enhance my digital photography  collection.I also agree with some others and wish it had a supplemental  fixed view finder like the DSC-S70, for bright sun and very low light  occasions.

This is my first camera and I must say that I'm really happy with my choice.  It seems it's hard to find a camera with all the features you want but this one had the most features.  What was important to me was a rechargeble lithium battery with good life and Sony is the only one I know of with the info lithium technology, included AC charger, MPEG movie capable, optical zoom, ease of use, customizable functions, USB connectivity, and of course picture quality.  With other cameras it seemed like you had to buy rechargeable batteries, a charger or they don't have USB support which is a must these days.  My only complaint is that it only comes with a 4mb memory stick which is not very useful but I bought a 16mb stick with it that turns out to be free with a $50 mail in rebate.  This is a great camera and I highly recommend it.","Date":"January 9, 2001"}

I was originally using an FD-73, but needed better resolution that this camera supplied.  With the Cybershot, you can choose you desired resolution.  After careful consideration of the FD-85 for its convenient floppy drive, I chose the cybershot.  A decision that I have not regretted.  The rotating lcd screen is a great idea and safeguard against breakage.  We actually cracked the screen on the previously mentioned camera while it was in its camera case in a suitcase during a vacation.  I have been very pleased with this lightweight camera's performance, user friendliness, and versatility.  However, my shopping list now includes a 64MB memory stick.  The 4MB stick included with the camera holds only 4 pictures in the highest resolution.","Date":"November 4, 2000"}
{"Title":"All around GREAT camera","Author":"\"jadedtim\"","ReviewID":"R33FJ629NWM059","Overall":"good","Content":"Quick facts about this camera: It's light, battery life lasts roughly 3 hours of straight use, and the 4MB Memory Stick supplied is decent. The user interface is so simple I NEVER had to get the instructions. There are so many personal tweaks you can adjust to the camera (white balance, black and white mode, timed exposures, 10 second timer, great zoom lens, macro mode... the list goes on!). The movable LCD screen is crisp and is very convenient to use. The camera feels solid and well-built.I personally bought a 32MB Memory Stick to gain more picture storage- this camera can now take 80-90 pictures at 1024x768 resolution. Also bought the Floppy Disk Adapter... but stick with the USB if you already have it on your computer. Also, one side note- this camera will be able to link to your Sony Playstation2 video game console in the future!","Date":"October 18, 2000"}

I was really impressed by the image quality, and the lithium-ion battery. The main complaint consumers have about digital cameras is battery consumption (I work as a tech-support agent for a digital camera manufacturer and field calls from customers on battery issues daily). The battery, the image quality, and the SONY name sold me on this excellent camera. The small memory stick that was included was a downside, but overall I am very happy. Getting the photos to the PC is very straight forward with no extra software to complicate things - you save images directly off the memory stick as if it were a floppy disk or CD-ROM disk through windows explorer. Easy as pie.","Date":"May 25, 2001"}

Then the Polaroid PDC-640...you get what you pay for. Now I have a Cybershot and am finally happy!I purchased this camera mainly because I couldn't get decent resolution in photos I use for computer wallpaper. This camera exceeded my wildest expectations.The download times, with the USB cable, are like Warp 9 vs. 1/4 impulse power from the Polaroid's serial interface. Battery life, WITH the LCD screen beats the pants off the Polaroid, I used to only shop for cameras that took alkaline batteries (I won't even talk about the Kodak, a BAD experience). The ability to add verbal notations with your pictures has been invaluable in my job. I think the only way to get (noticeably) better photo resolution is to spend another $1000 or more.The downsides are, of course, the 4 meg memory stick...lack of a carrying case...delay of shutter release. I won't call the lack of an optical viewfinder bad...the view through the one on my Polaroid never looked like the finished picture.All in all, with the addition of (at least) a 32 meg memory stick AND a decent carrying case, I have an excellent camera for many enjoyable years of photo opportunities.","Date":"December 19, 2001"}
{"Title":"Most Consistent Cam 6 yesrs later!","Author":"JimH \"JimH\"","ReviewID":"R99VCSZ7UHC12","Overall":"good","Content":"This was the first digital camera I ever owned and I stumbled across the amazon page for it and realized I never wrote a review for it, and it certainly deserves the glaring review I'm about to give it.I own 3 other digital cameras now that I have bought for various reasons (smaller, slr capabilities, large (3.0\" viewfinder) ) and while I am happy with them, none of them deliver more consistently impressive pictures in any surrounding you can think of like the Sony DSC-S50 does.What I am most happy with when it comes to this camera is its night shots. It takes amazong low light shots, I have taken so many incredible pictures at concerts and outdoors (las vegas) with it.The viewfinder is an incredible feature that guarantees perfectly framed self portrait shots, overhead shots, waist high shots, basically you can take a picture from an angle high or low and frame it perfectly because of the viewfinders ability to rotate.Now 2-megapixels isn't the greatest six years later, but I have printed and framed many 5x7's and even 8x10's from this camera (and other megapixel cams) and been very happy with their results and visitors to my home have always asked what kind of camera I took them with and are shocked it was with my trsuty six-year old 2 megapixel S-50.It is a little bulky by todays standards, but it is VERY durable. I have dropped and knocked around this camera for years and it still performs like new (save for one little plasitic knick near the arrow keys that doesn't effect functionality at all).The camera comes with one batterie and when I purchased it originally I bought an extra camera. To this day, they hold a very long charge and sonys battery feature that tells you down to the minute how much time is left on the battery is an incredible feature.The video clips can only record 15seconds at a time (with audio too) but I've fond that is just long enough for a fairly brisk \"happy birthday\" song!I cannot reccomend this camera enough for overall picture quality, functionality, eas-of-use and espeically for those on a budget. Memory Sticks in a suitable capacity for this camera are dirt cheap, and the camera itself is very affordable now.","Date":"November 26, 2007"}
{"Title":"A retrospecitve review","Author":"Nona Suomi","ReviewID":"R2T57O98B9LUO1","Overall":"good","Content":"It's now obviously long after this piece of antiquated hardware's life cycle, yet here I am writing a review for it. Why? Well read on to find out what's so special about this old Cybershot.In short, this thing is built like a brick. It has hung around for nearly a decade of constant use and abuse at my hands, and it's still kicking. I can't count the number of times I've forgotten to put on the oh-so-useful wrist strap and watch this camera fall three or more feet to hard concrete, only to pick it up and keep on going like nothing had happened.Its 2.1 megapixels are certainly low-end by now, with even my shiny new cell phone's camera outdoing it with a 3.2 MP built-in camera, but there's no beating having a full-size camera when you're taking photos. And besides, unless you plan to make literal wallpaper out of your vacation photos to Sea World, what's the big deal with having 6+ megapixels anyways? Proper composition beats computer editing any day in my book- you can't use Photoshop to change the fact that Dad sucks at taking photos, you can only make it less apparent...The LCD display is both a blessing and a curse- it's great to have a backlit display preview, but the lack of an optical viewfinder makes it a pain to set up shots in bright light. The single best thing about the screen though is the free rotation. I have yet to see another camera with this feature, and until I do I plan to keep this thing handy. Even when you aren't using it to take shots, it's useful since you can turn the LCD inwards, preventing any damage to the screen while the camera isn't in use, which has been the death of so many of my sister's newer cameras.The battery life on this thing has been great for me. I have not replaced the original battery, but still get over 120 minutes of use out of the InfoLithium M battery that shipped with it, not including any excessive use of the flashbulb.It's got a decent set of built-in controls, considering it was designed as a point-and-shoot camera. There's a number of effects to apply pre-shot, as well as brightness sensitivity, focus, etc.The Memory Sticks this device is capable of come in sizes up to 128 megabytes (I have not had any success in getting it to accept anything more recent such as the ProDuo line) but today you can pick up boxes of the 128 MB sticks from online dealers for next to nothing, so you'll never run out of storage space. On top of that, it takes quite a respectable number of photos (or not so many MPEG videos/voice recordings)  to fill up single 128MB memory stick, so you won't be swapping out the card every five minutes unless you're taking photos about once every two seconds.Seriously, the mere fact that this camera still gets the job done nearly ten years after its initial release says something about the quality of it. If Sony were to make their current cameras with this durability I might consider buying one.Bottom Line: If you could find this camera for sale new today, and didn't mind the low resolution (or trying to find working Vista drivers...) then definitely go for it.","Date":"July 17, 2009"}

I have nothing but great things to say about it...- It has held up through the worst abuse with me.  Even survived a few concrete drops.  Construction is awsome.- Optics are great.  I can get about 5in from an object before it gets blurry; and that is enough to get fine print off of something in great detail.  Zoom control is great once you get the hang of it.  Moving objects are usually no problem and you do not have to hold the camera extra-steady to aboid blurring either.- Colors are vibrant in most any light source.  I rarely have to mess with the brightness/contrast in PShop.  I don't know how, but image quality rivals 5 MP cameras that I've used.  I actually bought a Casio Exilim 5MP and resold it right away to stick with this.- Swivel LCD is useful for personal photos.  No dead pixels or problems with the LCD after years of USE!- Aftermarket batteries are $10 and work great.  Original used battery lasted 2 yrs.Might not be worth >$100 these days, but definitely close!  One thing's for sure, you definitely won't be the least dissapointed.","Date":"December 17, 2006"}

It can take reasnable MPEG movies and is very simple to use. Downloading the pictures onto computer proves to be quick and simple. The LCD screen is flexible allowing you better photos from awkward positions. The only small draw-back is that the shutter takes a bit too long too catch a fast moving object such as a bird.

{"Title":"I Love This Camera!","Author":"MacDoodle","ReviewID":"R3KRBPLXKETVT5","Overall":"good","Content":"As an amateur photographer and freelance web designer, I've always been particular about the quality of my photos as the camera captures them - and how well they will translate for web use. I'm as particular about my digital cameras as I am about my film cameras. This camera is my third digital camera purchase in 4 years, and I'm FINALLY happy!The quality of the images for both print and web use is excellent! (Hint: Jump on the Ofoto offer - it's well worth it!) The ability of the camera to go up to large formats - 1600 x 1200 - gives you the ability to print up to 20\" x 30\" photos. The 72 dpi assures you that there will be no wasted file size or web space when used for the web.Even though this camera is lightweight and compact, it has the power to get incredible focus and detail on small objects as well as larger objects caught with the 6x zoom - tripod suggested for zoom photos, as it would be with any other camera. I don't like to leave the house without a camera, but don't always want to carry my bulky cam bag with me - The Sony DSC-S50 is the perfect size to drop into my purse or briefcase!The filter effects let me shoot the same scene in several different modes - B&W;, Sepia, etc. This is a nice feature for artistic experiments, but a little cumbersome in getting there. Effects reset to standard mode when you shut the camera off, which can be annoying when trying to compose and focus while using filter effects.Sony could have cut the price of the camera (or included a larger capacity Memory Stick) by not including the MPEG movie feature, and some of the filters. The MPEGS are nice, good quality, but limited on time/size when using a smaller size Memory Stick and IMPO, don't need to be on a still camera. Best advice I can give for this camera is order a 32mb or larger Memory Stick when ordering the camera. The 4mb stick that comes with it is useless if shooting large size images.Yes, the camera is totally worth the price! Buy it!","Date":"March 10, 2002"}

It takes excellant photos, the resolution is plenty for most any photos, and I like the display that flips up and turns 180 degrees so you can take your own photos (the new Cybershot models don't do this). The MPEGs with sound are really cool and everyone I have shown this too has been amazed that it takes videos with sound. The display is sometimes difficult to see in bright light, and it does not have a viewfinder, but I seem to adapt to this limitation without any problems. I like it more than most other brands of digital cameras and the memory sticks are priced right and hold a lot of photos. I bought the memory stick floppy disk adapter and it makes it easy to read the photos even though the USB interface is really simple to use also, if your computer has one. Just plan to have a CR-RW drive so you can save your photos and clear off the memory stick for taking more. It puts the time and date on your photos for recording when they were taken right on the print, which I have heard most other digital cameras don't do this. It is the perfect size, not too big, and it takes photos that make me look like a professional. I have taken beautiful sunsets that the exposure would not have been right if I had taken them with a 35mm camera. The menu system is great, and the camera has a large display (larger than the new Cybershot models) and a way to flip it around so it is protected from being scratched. I really like it and recommend buying it over the new equivalent model.","Date":"December 20, 2001"}
{"Title":"Fantastic Camera With a Few Flaws","Author":"David Marshall","ReviewID":"R2OHE7M932GEAE","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the first digital camera I have owned so I can't compare it to others, but this one does most of what I want to do and more than I actually use. I bought it because I, in a strained sense of scurry, drove 200 miles to see my first grandchild and left my 35mm camera at home. I had seen reviews before purchasing but weighed all the options before buying this one. The zoom is great for a small camera but not like a 28-210 Kiron. The ease of use is fabulous for a point and click buff but includes helpful adjustments for lighting, various resolutions, and more. Short video clips of the new \"Princess\" are priceless. Relatives enjoy viewing the \"day's catch\" with the slide show feature. Takes fantastic pictures that I print using my home computer or upload for professional printing. A few flaws I've seen mentioned (...) on which I concur: 4mb memory stick takes 4 pics at 1600x1200, not very useful. I bought 2 64mb sticks (aboout 80 pictures each). I tend to keep almost all of the pictures I take until I've had time to review closer so I won't delete pictures I wish I had back. LCD screen is very hard to see in bright sunlight and since I like the sun to my back and not to the subject's back, well, you get the picture (pun intended). You cannot see subject on LCD at night without lighting assistance. Works best inside, but takes great outdoor pictures if you can frame what you're tryng to photograph. I'm sure more expensive cameras will do more (and they're all over-priced), but for the comparative price range, this one is great.","Date":"December 18, 2001"}

Now there are reasons and some flaws. No viewfinder just a screen. 2.1mp can be found on anything now but the lens is what really makes it. The macro mode is better than ANY point and shoot I've ever used period. I can get 1/4\" away and it'll still focus with a super sharp clear picture. I've tried a $1,200 point and shoot macro and it was put to shame. The guys at the camera store literally couldn't believe their eyes. Battery life of 2+ days, seriously that is just great.

The LCD screen is the best I've had the privledge of viewing.  Also, the screen twisting capability makes it really easy to compose regardless of subject position.  The on screen display and joystick control make it a snap to navigate between options.  The picture taking is fast compared to other cameras I've used that have a 2-3 second delay.  Also, power on and zoom is fast.  The battery life is fantastic for a digital camera.  At this point, the perfect camera for me...Unfortunately, the bad makes this camera completely useless for me.  The pictures are awful, even though others have written good reviews.  At first I thought it might be user error, so I went through all the manuals, tried a bunch of different settings, took flash and ambient light pictures... all had the same result...  dark pictures and lacking definition.

Despite its fixed-focus lens (or  perhaps because of the simplicity of it!), I've captured some great candid  moments with it.  It is easy to use, has almost no lag in capturing images,  and uses the relatively inexpensive and quickly swappable SmartMedia cards.  It's also the first digital camera I've owned built tough enough for me to  be willing to carry around shoved in a pocket.  The macro mode is very  useful for \"capturing\" little bits of nature.  The flash works  well, though, like any camera-mounted flash, \"red eye\" is a  problem only partly solved.  The 1280 X 960 pixel image size is just right  for computer monitor screen-filling display and adequate snapshot-sized  printouts.I do recommend investing in a USB-connected SmartMedia card  reader, though.  In addition to the greater downloading speed, you can also  access the images directly from any (Windows 98 in my case) graphics  applications instead of having to transfer via the Fuji interface software.  Downloading images with the serial interface built into the camera itself  is a dreadfully slow process, and the only reason I gave this camera only 4  stars.I'm currently researching the digital cameras that have arrived  since I bought the MX-1200, to help a family member who is in the market  for one.  Although the pixel counts are slowly creeping up with newer  models, the value and utility have not.","Date":"July 27, 2000"}
{"Title":"transferring images","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3IZQ17RAQ1VPL","Overall":"good","Content":"I have a digital camera, not this particular model. I was reviewing comments on this model (searching for a reasonably price model for a friend) when I notice criticism regarding download times.  Please note:  All the digital cameras will take a noticeable amount of time to download images to your PC if you are using the serial cable that came with the camera. However there are faster means. If you have one that uses either a smart media card or a compact flash card, you can buy a reader for either your parallel port or your USB port.  Remove the card from your camera and insert it in the reader. Then the card will appear as if it is another disk drive on your PC. Use Explorer to copy all the files to your real hard disk drive. Thats the fastest way to get them to your PC.  Forget the serial connector unless you only plan to transfer one or two images. It takes too long.  (the previous reviewer and other may not be aware of this when they are buying the camera but this irritating issue applies to all digital cameras not just this one. Its the serial port thats slow.)Second, there is criticism regarding the cost of a 32MB card which cost over $100.  I found 64MB compact flash card for around $120 on the internet so search around. Also you have to remember you won't have to buy more memory cards. simply delete the pictures on the card and you are all set to capture more.  Most cameras come with only an 8 Mb card so a 4 Mb for this Fuji is below what many other cameras provide BUT its also cost less. It looks to be one of the least expensive 1 Meg pixel camera around. You're going to have to buy another card if you want to be able to take more pictures before returning to your PC (when you are traveling.. unless you bring your laptop) even if you have a 8Mb card. Look at the Olympus 360 & 460 models at $300 & $400. They only come with 8 Mb also. The primary difference between them and this model will be a) more zoom options and b) image quality.  The resolution may be slightly higher and color accuracy may be better.. you'll need to review some comparison reviews on accuracy.  Another note: you can take more pictures that just 13 (26-27 on an 8 Mb card) if you settle for less resolution. If you plan to PRINT the image, then stay with the best resolution but if you only want to use it to create a screen saver so email the photos then you can reduce the image resolution to be able to take more pictures on the same 4 Mb or 8Mb card.","Date":"October 5, 2000"}

I just wanted a simple camera that was cheap enough but put out quality  images. There are no complaints from me. The 1280x960 images are crisp and  when I purchased a 32meg smartmedia card (that's the max that it takes) you  can take 40 to 90 or so 1.3 megapixel pix. The 4meg card that it comes with  doesn't allow much room for creativity.  For the sake of sanity, I had  to buy a smartmedia usb reader in order to keep the battery consumption to  a minimum. The built-in serial connection takes forever and eats battery  power. I think this is true for all cams though. Battery life is good for  this camera. Using standard alkaline batteries and keeping the use of the  LCD viewer to a minimum, I was able to use the camera for a full 7 days and  shoot some 200 pix. I think the camera is slightly too expensive (...) but it's rugged and takes good snapshots.","Date":"August 24, 2000"}
{"Title":"A great amateur camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2WM1X5KS9VI90","Overall":"good","Content":"We've owned this camera for nine months and have been very satisfied. It takes great clear pictures both indoors and out. It's compact size makes it very portable. We've used it for family photos, school projects, web postings and even an occasional portrait.Other reviewers are right about the slow download times with the serial port. But the camera should not be faulted for that because it is true for all cameras with serial connections. We got a USB card reader as a rebate item with the purchase. It has made all the difference in the world. Since most cameras with similar features and resolution are selling for 350+ you are still better off buying this camera with a USB card reader.Wealso suggest you purchase a set of recargeable NiCa batteries--they keep their charge well and work great. Also don't buy a 16  or 32 Meg card, buy two or more 8 Meg. It's easier to keep your pictures straight and you can keep one by the computer while you are working and the other one with the camera.","Date":"October 15, 2000"}
{"Title":"Slow transfers, slow picture-taking, and no space","Author":"\"wcfrench\"","ReviewID":"R13HE5HL8Z86KZ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've been using my Fujifilm for about 3 months now, and the bad things are starting to outweigh the good as I'm seeing the vast array of digital  cameras on the market.  I didn't have much time to choose between cameras  when I bought this one, but it looked like a good deal.  Looks can be  deceiving though.  I'm not saying it's a bad camera, and it may turn out to  be excellent... for a beginner.  First of all, the camera comes with a  serial cable.  No matter how much juice you try to pump through the cable,  you only wind up getting about 1 picture per minute transfer time.  That  might be ok if you download your pictures once a day, but most people  won't.  Secondly, the picture-taking is much too slow if you're trying to  capture something within a small time frame.  There's a slight lag when  pressing the button, about 1/2 to 1 second, which might sound unimportant  in text, but it seems like a lot more when you're the one taking the  picture.  Not to mention the camera doesn't actually \"snap\" until  you fully release the button, unlike most cameras usually snapping when you  press the button.  This makes it EXTREMELY hard to explain to someone if  you want someone else to take a picture for you, like when you're on  vacation.  Besides the lag in the initial snap, you have to wait a good 6-7  seconds before you can take another picture.  That's just unacceptable if  you're trying to take a picture of something passing and you took the  picture just a second too soon and want to get another try.  There's no  second chances.  And lastly, the problem of storage.  The Fujifilm comes  with a 4 meg memory capacity.  This only holds 13 pictures when the camera  is set normally.  If you want to get any decent space out of it, you'd have  to purchase the 32 meg storage card, which costs 110 bucks.  By this time,  you've (I've) spent over 300 dollars and have a camera that's not as good  as other 300+ dollar cameras. In summary, the only way I would recommend  this camera is if a) You have plenty of time on your hands to download  pictures b) You are taking pictures of lifeless objects c) You plan on  downloading your pictures very oftenTake it for what it's worth.","Date":"September 19, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent Camera","Author":"Brenda J. Abasolo \"georgiapeach69\"","ReviewID":"R1WO2K76TYM5OE","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased the Fuji MX-1200 as my first digital camera about three months ago and am more than happy with it.  It's compact, very easy to use and takes good quality pictures.  Sure, there are other models out there with more bells and whistles, but for this price range, this is an excellent choice.It doesn't come with an instruction manual for the Picture Shuttle and editing software (well, mine didn't arrive with any software manual), but it was easy to figure out and I had my second batch of pictures loaded, cropped and sent out in emails within 30 minutes.As others here have pointed out, it IS a good idea to purchase a USB Flash Memory Reader for transfering the photos from camera to hard drive (although I didn't find the serial port download time as incredibly slow as I thought it would be).  Two or three sets of batteries or better yet, rechargable batteries, are a MUST.  Every digital camera (not just this one) eats them quickly if you use the LCD display constantly.Also a must...a SmartMedia card.  The MX-1200 comes with only a 4meg, which only allows taking 12 pictures on the lowest setting.  With a 16meg card, you can hold over 60 pictures.","Date":"December 9, 2000"}

Sure, you could spend a lot more for a camera that is a lot more high-tech, but if you just want a camera to learn on and experiment with or just take fun family snaps, then this camera would be great.My husband actually won a photo contest with a 5x7 photo taken on this camera (printed on an HP printer). Pros: low cost, easy to use, easy to figure out how to take good photos, takes good enough quality photos to replace your film camera (if you're ready for that... I'm not quite there).Cons: memory card pretty small if you want to take high quality pics  (We got a 64MB memory card--available on costco.com--so we could take many pictures at high quality settings: about 100 pictures on the highest quality settings.), slow upload to your computer using serial cable (we got a SmartMedia drive that hooks up to our USB port and is lightning quick), lower picture quality capability than many (more expensive) cameras on the market.These days, most digital cameras really aren't that horrible , and this camera is lightyears better than the ($) cameras that were out 4 years ago.  This camera would be great for someone who wants a camera for casual use, or for pictures for their website, or even regular pictures that won't be blown up much larger than 5x7.  We take pictures with abandon now, not worrying about how much film we have left, not worrying if a shot is going to be a throw-away (you can delete it right on the camera, anyway), and we have gotten some truly beautiful and priceless shots just using this camera.  If you're not a professional photographer, why spend thousands when you can get this camera at a great price?","Date":"December 12, 2001"}

Highly recommend a USB card reader - even using TWAIN/Photoshop 5.5 it takes FOREVER to download 1280 x 820 res pictures (the camera's middle setting).  All my complaints are minor - this is a great camera overall.  The mode select knob can stop in between modes, but look like it's pointing to a mode.  This makes you think something is wrong until you move the switch the 1mm it's off so you are not between modes.  Not a show stopper, just takes getting used to.  I guess all camers mow batteries, but I bought 8 NiMh rechargables and that seems to work.  Get a cord to plug in when you're downloading pix - will save batteries, especially if you are using the serial cable.  The optical viewfinder is way off for anything closer than about 10 feet, so I almost always use the LCD - another battery killer.  Camera won't auto shut off when in PC mode, I've drained lots of batteries when forgetting to switch the camera off after retrieving photos.  These are really nit-pick items, most cameras would have same or similar. Overall I'm happy with this camera, it's well made and user friendly. For the money and 1.3 Megpixel is plenty for general use.  Safe bet you will feel your money was well spent.","Date":"March 23, 2001"}

I have taken it to Scotland, Hungary, Austria and Germany and have been totally amazed at how good a picture it provides in a small package for a small amount of money.I am not a newcomer to photography. I have owned several 35 mm. SLR's of various brands. I still have a Canon that I can use if I want to, but I havent't taken it out of the case since I got the Fuji. My recommendations are similar to those of other reviewers, with one exception. Forget about the USB reader. Get a \"Flash Card\" floppy disk adapter. It costs more, but it will download to any PC. Naturally, you should purchase as many addtional smart cards as you can afford. They are getting cheaper now, so a couple of 32 meg cards would be in order. I carry a half dozen of them when I travel and download my pictures to my notebook computer every evening at the end of my day. Nowadays, most of my pictures end up on the internet, so the Fuji was a step up for me rather than a step down.

Been taking it out to clubs and raves (night shots, lots of laser lights, etc) and the quality has been amazing. I have had 3 people, whom after using mine, have bought the same model.  There are two drawbacks: the battery life is a little short if you use the display. But why use it? With smartmedia cards, you can afford to take as many bad pictures as you want. Also, another drawback is that if you're taking pictures where there is a lot of dust or fog and the flash is used, you'll see the particles being illuminated in the picture. This'll look like someone is blowing \"soap bubbles\". But it's no biggie since I usually avoid taking pictures in this kind of environment anyway. I do recommend you pick up the 32mb smartmedia card (I've taken about 60 pictures in one night on highest setting with room to spare) AND a usb smartmedia card reader for your camera, though.","Date":"December 2, 2000"}

The 1.3 megapix resolution is very good and better than most need for the majority of situations. This camera is so compact that I find myself taking it more places, more often.

{"Title":"Affordable and reliable","Author":"The WB","ReviewID":"RF4OG07K4634U","Overall":"good","Content":"Late coming to the review, I still want to share my 10 years of experience using the Fujifilm MX-1200.  I purchased this blister pack camera on December 31, 1999 as a New Millennium present for myself and for taking my first plunge into digital photography after shooting 35 MM film for almost 30 years prior.  Call it skepticism or a leap of faith with high expectations at that time, I started down the road of digital photography.From the very first time I picked up this camera, I loved the benefits of digital photography.  The MX-1200 changed my thinking and recaptured the excitement of photography for me once again:* The benefit of viewing the picture at the time it was taken on the 1.6\" rear screen viewer.* The first real higher resolution (1.3 MP, sounds funny now) pictures at a reasonable price.* Continuous or resettable picture naming/numbering when saving to disk.* The ability to swap media cards for virtually unlimited picture taking.* Adjustable flash settings, White Balance control, EV settings to manually adjust different exposures.* Two image saving sizes and three different compression levels.* Using AA batteries instead of a proprietary battery as a power source.* Manual and automatic picture viewing prior to saving to the card.* Excellent tonal/contrast qualities, especially with interior flash pictures.* Light metering works great, giving a good overall exposure, considering the hardware available at that time.* Tough housing and durable internal workings -- after a number of drops, this camera still works fine.This camera is not without short comings either (many of these points were resolved with the advancements in digital photography technologies) .  Retrospectively, the MX-1200 shortcomings  included:* Right off the bat, the Fujifilm picture shuttle software was horrible.* Transferring pictures from the camera to the computer via serial cable was nothing short of pure torture!* Oh, yea -- flash memory was outrageously priced per megabyte -- in early 2000, an 8 MB SM card cost $50.00!* Low light shooting -- a real Fujifilm let down, even today.* The best pictures were obtained only when shooting at 1280 x 960 using minimum compression -- memory used was high.* It was not until USB card readers became available and SmartMedia cards dropped in price did the real joy of this camera grip me.* Fixed lens focusing is preset at 38 MM (35 MM film equivalent).  There is NO optical zoom.* 2 X digital zoom is a complete joke -- it shrank the picture down to 640 * 480 and was grainer with little enlargement benefit.* Macro mode worked, but it took multiple attempts to capture the shot.* NO internal storage flash memory.* NO multi-shot capabilities.* NO movie mode.* Settings must be reset when the batteries die or are removed from the camera (same issue today with my S100FS also).* The \"White Dust\" phenomenon is horrible when using the flash with this camera.* SmartMedia cards -- an Olympus/Fujifilm creation that didn't last beyond 2004 -- when they dropped it completely.Despite all of the shortcomings listed above, the age of the technologies involved and the lower quality image from a very simple 1.3 MP Point & Shoot camera, I'm still amazed at how the picture quality holds up after all of these years.  I continue to use this camera today as a backup to my Fujifilm S100FS in situations that I don't want to expose the newer Fuji to for the concern of loss or damage.  In terms of photographic quality between these two cameras -- there is no comparison for very obvious reasons.  But, owning and using the MX-1200, the Great, Great Grandfather of Fujifilm digital cameras has been a pleasureful experience for me as I watched and used succeeding generations of digital cameras mature into the quality cameras we now have today.","Date":"December 31, 2009"}

{"Title":"Great product with great features! but...","Author":"\"no_x\"","ReviewID":"R3KVJ70NU5G4HU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the S70 about two months ago and I shot a lot of pictures with it: its light weight, compact size and ease of use even with one hand (the  right of course :) ) make the perfect digital camera for ME. I was really  impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...)  although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. As many  other digital cameras, there are many features such as crop/resize a  picture, choose between 6 different resolutions, zoom in a picture (to look  for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a  lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using  the digital one unless you're perfectly still), several effects (sepia,  black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder  with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see  anything using the LCD display)... you can even shoot a movie with it! Why  only 4 stars ? Simply because it comes with a 8Mo memory stick (come on  Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mo unless we use the 640x480 resolution!),  there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not  that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking  for when you don't know your camera. However, it's still very easy to  use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and  try again! Want to have a look at your pictures ? Turn a switch to  \"play mode\" and use the arrows of a small pad to navigate among  them, delete, resize... then just plug your USB connector to your PC and  with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your machine, just  like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you  want. The stamina rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much  time you have. In short, I think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it  even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mo but  you can go with a 32Mo). It has all the features of the other digital  cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is  commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution  which is obviously excellent but the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to  use, except for the menu. I've used it in trade shows, parties with  friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from  a plane! Last but not least, even if I print a lot of pictures with this  camera, using a pretty good Epson printer (but not a photo printer, no need  for it), I still have a good 35mm when I want to have a professional  result. That makes sense, doesn't it?","Date":"July 24, 2000"}

Not only does it take wonderful pictures in a variety of settings, but it also comes with a lot of small, easy to forget about features that add up to a great overall usage experience and that make the camera a much better real value than most of its competitors.Some of these include an internal, rechargeable Lithium Ion battery that shows you, in minutes, how much more time you have left before recharging is required, a built in USB port (no external cradles are required), all required cables, a built in memory stick slot and included memory stick (although the included 8MB stick is too small, you should definitely pick up at least a 32MB stick), and an AC adapter included (believe it or not, a lot of digital cameras don't come with an AC adapter and since digicams eat up batteries this really makes a big difference).These types of small things are often overlooked in reviews, but in long-term, real-world use, they really do make a difference.The only negatives that I've experienced are things that other reviewers have mentioned, the included memory stick is too small and the camera does not come with a carrying case, which you should definitely get if you plan on traveling with the camera.Some quick notes, while the camera works flawlessly with both Windows 98 and MacOS based computers, a Windows 2000 driver does not yet seem to be available.","Date":"October 10, 2000"}

Every thing good/bad about this camera has already been said here so I would like to cover a couple other features not mentioned - some of these notes are mine, others from WWW sites and newsgroup posts.The one second shutter delay can be somewhat shortened by half depressing the shutter button. The S-70 will the autofocus, which makes up most of the shutter lag. When you then press down the button all the way you'll find it will almost instantly take the picture. Several other techniques can be used to minimize the delay: 1) go to manual focus, 2) go to AE mode, 3) go to manual WB - the less auto, the faster the camera.MPEG recording for 60 seconds. I would like to correct one reviewer regarding making videos with this camera - If you switch to the smaller resolution, and hold down the shutter button, you will get a minute of video. This is the max though. The camera has to store the raw video in internal memory, then convert it to mpeg and write it to the memory stick. The camera can only fit 15 seconds of large resolution video, and 60 seconds of small resolution video in the internal memory. There is no way to get more than this much video. OR.. reduce the size to 160 x 120 and  get 1 minute per segment.EXIF information - data is automatically imbedded into the file when saved in the camera. The data includes the time and date the picture was taken, but also all information on the f-stop used, program mode chosen, shutter speed, flash utilisation and more. Much of this information can be seen by opening the image in MGI PhotoSuite (the version that came with your camera--or a later version) and selecting \"Image Information\" under the Image menu. If you choose to keep the information after downloading to your computer, you must ensure that the original is kept ( if you save the jpg file as something else, you lose the exif information). You can RENAME the file, but opening it and saving or modifying it in any way will lose the info.I use Photoshop to edit and crop files, but always save as the PSD photoshop native format, which keeps the original jpg file untouched. I also chose the \"serial\" numbering option on the camera, which allows the memory stick contents to be moved to the PC in the same folder without having the \"file exists\" problem. (It carries on automatically with DSC00678.jpg etc, rather than going back to DSC0001.jpg every time a new stick is inserted or reused).","Date":"October 19, 2000"}

However, the S70 earned my money because of its image quality, ease of use, and USB connectivity.In the past, Sony built good cameras with  innovative features; however, the image quality has always been suspect in  the minds of aspiring photo amateurs and professionals.  With the DSC-S70,  Sony got it right!One of the reasons that older Sony digital cameras had  mediocre image quality was because of their mediocre lenses.  Sony knew  this; so, they found someone who was really good at making lenses: Carl  Zeiss.  For me, the most impressive feature of this camera is the 21 mm  Carl Zeiss, Vario-Sonnar lens.  I've used and admired Zeiss optics for many  years in film photography.  This lens yields excellent resolution, coupled  with brilliant colors.  Lesser lenses yield images with a focused center;  however, the edges and corners would not be as sharp.  Not with this camera  -- every pixel is clear and the details are impressive for even the most  discerning eyes.Another reason that I got this camera is because of the  wide variety of apertures and shutter speeds.  The aperture ranges from  f/2.0 to f/8.0 and the shutter speed can vary from 8 to 1/1000 seconds.  Although the S70 doesn't feature a full manual exposure mode, you get a  reasonable degree of control.At the time I got this camera, Sony only  offered Windows 95 & 98 drivers.  I'm delighted that Sony now offers  support for Windows 2000.  Installation was a breeze.  You can find the  Win2K drivers here on Sony's site ...The battery life is  pretty good.  On a full charge, you can take roughly 2 hours worth of use.  The battery meter is pretty accurate, which indicates the number of minutes  remaining.  Although the memory stick technology is proprietary, it's easy  to use and very convenient.  The 8 MB memory stick that comes with the  camera is pathetic.  You need more to take many high resolution pictures,  preferably the 64 MB, which is the Sony's largest to date.  Rumor has it  that Sony is making a 128 MB version of their popular memory stick -- way  cool!  I would recommend getting an extra battery and a 64 MB memory stick  -- using the 8MB memory stick as an emergency only backup.Good luck, and  have fun with your new S70!","Date":"August 16, 2000"}

I chose the DSC-S70 at the recommendation of the  sales person who also owned one.  It is very easy to use out of the box and  you can get as deep as you want into the many features of the camera.  The  pictures are very impressive - excellent resolution with vibrant colors!  I  am having a blast with the movie feature - excellent for e-mails.  The  rechargeable battery has a long life and is quickly recharged.  I did buy a  64M memory stick and that has been very adequate, the 8M does not cut  it.  I highly recommend this camera.  If you do a lot of shooting I  would definitely purchase another battery and a larger memory stick  however.","Date":"August 29, 2000"}
{"Title":"Easy to use","Author":"Marsha","ReviewID":"R16OWBW531A4D0","Overall":"good","Content":"My wife wanted ease of use and I wanted optical resolution and zoom. The DSC-S70 met both our requirements. We've had the camera for about four months and are still very satisfied.Some good things about the camera: The pictures are great. Printed on an Epson 2500 they look photo quality. The Info lithium battery goes forever and is quick to recharge. The LCD display controls are easy to learn. Lot's of flexibility in recording and exposure modes if you care to operate other than automatic. The video playback, both pictures and video clips, is straight forward and works well.Some things to think about: The included 8MB memory stick is too small. I ended up buying two 64MB sticks, and at about $120 each I think they're too spendy, but then so is SmartMedia and Flash. If you have any other Sony products that use memory sticks it takes some of the sting out of buying extra memory. The delay when the camera 'sets up the exposure' (shutter button part way down) takes some getting used to. Picture processing time at the highest resolution is about half a second so there's no 'rapid fire' picture taking.If you're a Windows 2000 user you'll have to get the USB drivers from Sony's website. It took a Sony technician almost one-hour to find them for me. Once installed the camera worked fine with Windows 2000.","Date":"January 1, 2001"}

Maxwell \"tjmaxwell\"","ReviewID":"R2AXMLNZTQGK0S","Overall":"good","Content":"Like many of the other reviewers, I have read countless reviews about Digital Cameras before I made my choice.  While many reviews preferred the Nikon CoolPix 990 or Olympus 3030Z better, I chose this one for several reasons.  First off, the image quality is phenominal thanks to the Zeiss lens.  Secondly, this camera is around ($)cheaper than both of the others with comparable features.  Finally, you'll need to spend a lot less on accessories with this one as compared to the other two.  This camera comes with a built in battery charger and an AC-Adapter.  Those two things would run you about ($) with the other cameras.  Also, the memory sticks aren't as hard to find as everyone makes them out to be and they are in fact cheaper than SmartMedia or CompactFlash cards of equivalent sizes.  Throw that in with the fact that this camera bears the Sony name, and does a much better job of reducing the red-eye phenominon (which really really plagues the other two cameras I mentioned) during portraits, and you have the best value available in this price range, period.","Date":"October 17, 2000"}

I was able to begin using all of the camera features immediately without having to read the manual.  What made it less than perfect?  The auto-focus and processing delay when shooting in high resolution is slow enough to make moving/action shots almost impossible to time properly. (2-3 seconds) I also experienced some problems interfacing the USB port to some Windows 95 R2 (with USB updates)based PCs.  I found it to work perfectly with Windows 98.

I was especially impressed with how good it shoots in low light situations. The rechargeable battery is very good, but buy an extra. The same goes for the memory stick, you really need to invest in the larger capacity memory sticks, I found a need for 3 when on vacation.Problems: The LCD is hard to read in bright sunlight (common to all) but you still have an eye viewer - that's good. Next there is a delay time between pressing the shutter and the actual taking of the picture (you get used to this) and secondly the recycle time between pictures is a few seconds, so rapid fire shooting is not possible.I have also switched this camera to \"black and white\" mode for outdoor scenery shots and it works very well. With easily obtainable software, like Adobe Photo Shop, you can change the contrast and brightness easily for more striking effects. When taking normal color photos you can also enhance contrast and colors to enhance or exaggerate for some great \"artistic\" effects. I then use a well known HP printer for $200 or less and get great photo prints when using their high quality glossy or matte photo paper.","Date":"December 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Ok But...","Author":"bobo","ReviewID":"R2M4OWDXMT5YH4","Overall":"good","Content":"The S70's focusing system is slow and can be inaccurate when the intended subject is off-center. Some shadow areas or low light photos cause chromatic aberrations. The worst camera problem however is the over-saturation of primary colors especially red. What at first may appear, as a vibrant color upon closer inspection really is an unnatural boost of certain colors in the camera's processing algorithm.  This occurs to the point of eliminating detail and subtleties.But my biggest complaint is not the camera but Sony. I have had the s70 since July 00' and attempted to find the one basic item/accessory that any camera owner with common sense would want - a filter for lens protection.  The camera requires an adapter to attach ANY filter or lens. Not only could I not find this basic accessory anywhere on the net but also Sony has yet to fill my 2 Month+ order. To add to the frustration the filters were available immediately and have sat collecting dust for two months. The point here is 1) Manufacturers need to stop releasing products without simultaneously making available the basic items that are necessary to make the products useful - a 3 month wait is too long. 2) It seems that for some reason with digital cameras both retail and e-com stores while selling a wide variety of camera brands carry very few supplies/accessories for these same products. 3) Basic items should be included in the kit.  It seems to me that the best time to get a customer to buy the basic accessories is at the original time and place of purchase.","Date":"October 20, 2000"}

The only problem I had was getting it away from my wife once she learned how to use it. Also Sony was very cheap in only shipping a 8MB memory stick which is a joke.

One of the deciding factors in my choice to buy this camera over others was the menu.  I was able to understand the options and figure out the camera without reading the manual.  For some other cameras I looked at, I couldn't figure out how to change the picture size or file format.  The other features that I was looking for were the USB cable, a decent optical zoom, macro mode, and at least 3 megapixels.Things I like about this camera:Picture quality -  I am only an amateur photographer, but the color, contrast, brightness, and sharpness all seem great to me.Ease of menu use - as decribed aboveMacro mode - Lets me take great close-up pictures of flowers, butterflies, and other random things.Memory Stick - Granted I bought the 64MB Memory Stick extra, but it holds a lot.  I generally take about 1/4 of my pictures in JPEG mode at 2048x1536 and 3/4 at 1600x1200 (which is still way bigger than my monitor); using this scheme I have been able to take more than 60 pictures at one time with room left over for more.USB cable - I can download a full Memory Stick of pictures (64MB) onto my hard drive in under 3 minutes.Battery - It comes with a rechargable battery so you don't have to buy one.Things I don't like:Focus time - It takes about one second to find the focus before it takes a picture, which can make it hard to time action shots.Software - I don't use the image editing software that came with the camera because I already had something better.","Date":"June 30, 2001"}
{"Title":"Film Has Finally Been Surpassed","Author":"cornhusker001","ReviewID":"R1I0HT6V4DQ7RQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my DSC-S70 because my family and I were about to go on vacation to London and I felt that the image quality from digital cameras had finally surpassed film-based cameras.  I absolutely love my DSC-S70 and recommend it to anyone that is interested in getting a digital camera.  I have not had any troubles with my DSC-S70.  The only real problem I had was finding 64 MB Memory Sticks since none of the local stores had gotten them in yet.  I had to settle for 2 32 MB ones.  But since each one is equivalent to a roll of 35 mm film when you use the highest JPEG setting, it wasn't really a problem.  I only took one bad picture during the entire vacation, and that was because my brother bumped in to me when I pressed the shutter and I didn't notice it until later.  Although I felt that the 8 MB Memory Stick was a little small, I'd rather pay for the little bit of memory that I actually need than pay for the memory that I will never use.  I may have needed 64 MB for my trip to London, but in most cases, I'll never need to take more than 8 MB with me.  Sony also gives you a ... gift certificate for its online store if you register your camera online.  If you use this gift certificate towards another 8 MB stick, it will only cost you ..., giving you the same amount of memory that all the other cameras give.  And now, I think they give you ... back if you buy a memory stick with the camera.  I found the MPEG performance to be quite pleasing, especially in the HQ mode.  It had no problems adjusting from a close-up to a wide shot and was able to catch details like the pixels on an LCD screen.  All of my shots came out crystal clear.  I took my shots of Piccadilly Circus and turned them into a 360 degree panorama that looked as good as any of the professional ones on the Internet.  Even on the brightest days, the camera produced excellent results.  I would have been comfortable with the camera and its menu system even if I hadn't read the manual.  The icons in the Program AE mode are confusing UNTIL you read the manual.  Remember that this isn't a cheap film camera with just one button; you actually have options about what your picture will look like.  I tried the Olympus 3030 in the store and was absolutely confused with its icons, but not with the Sony DSC-S70.  I am very pleased with this camera and would buy it again if I had the chance.","Date":"April 17, 2001"}

But after using it and the software included to retouch some wedding photos. I will keep the camera. It is easy to use and prints very well on my H/P 772. Using the H/P premium glossy paper produces very professional results. I am still trying to get the sizes coordinated for printing as the program is driving me and I feel I should be driving it. I am sure with practice it will come.  The camera is basically point-and-shoot, if you like the shot keep it if you don't delete and do it again. Everything is automatic and does a great job of compensating for conditions. Most of my photos have been indoors with a few outdoor shots which also turned out well.  NEGATIVES; 1.It has a hefty price tag.  2.Sony is stingy with the 8Mb memory stick, which is good for about 5 photos at 2048X1600 Pixies. I bought a 32 Mb stick and use the 8Mb stick for practice shots.  A 32 or a 64 should come along with the ... retail tag.  3.Also a protective carrying case would be nice.

Taking a risk a while back and purchasing this camera (at a much higher price than 749) I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pictures. The Zeiss lens that the camera has just takes absolutely beautiful pictures. Being a fool, I gave this camera  away as a gift thinking I would be able to take even better photos with the Nikon 990, eventually shelling out more for the Nikon but getting the same performance with a little better control on the white balance. Now that I've experienced not only the DSCS70, the 990, but also the Olympus 3030Zoom, I'm itching to once again get this camera. The one recommendation I can give when buying this camera is that you buy the 64mb memory stick and get an extra battery. I personally can't wait for sony to release a 128mb stick for this camera which I think is to be released some time this year.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

As I climb up on the learning curve of all the camera's functioanlities, I think that it is a very fine piece of precision instrument and worth every penny of its price.Some users, I believe, have overlooked the advanced functions of the camera. The shutter speed, for example, can be adjusted in 13 steps from 1/8 sec. to 1/1000 of a second in taking pictures of a moving subject. And the aperture can be adjusted in 9 steps from F2.0 to F8.0.Another great feature is the selection of alternative image sizes. I used to use the 1290 x 960 size which would allow 96 images with a 64 mb memory stick. Then I found the quality of the picture was sufficiently good even if I went down to 640 x 480 size which would allow 760 images with the same 64 mb memory stick. During my recent vacation in France, I recorded several hundred images on one single memory stick. (But don't forget to bring your international electical adapter since you have to recharge the battery every night.)Lastly, the German Zeiss lens is definitely superior to other cameras' lenes on the market.I think that the camera has a good chance of becoming a collector's item since Sony has already stopped production of this model.","Date":"April 16, 2002"}

Since then, I have tried several different digital cameras but none come close to the accuracy of the color reproduction of the DSC-S70. This can be attributed to the superior optics designed by Carl Zeiss. The movie mode is great too although, your limited to 15 second clips. I have posted some pics here on Amazon. Take a look at the quality of the macro shots. It may not be the fastest or the most portable camera but it does take consistently good pics.

Like all new electronic products, it takes awhile to learn all the ins and outs, but once you do, you'll be pleased with all the things this camera can do.  The quality of the photos is great.  With the USB connection, you can print directly from the camera if you want.  I was pleased with the light, contrast, level of detail, etc. when I printed.  The 8Mg memory stick doesn't hold much -- only 5 pictures at the 2048 x 1536 resolution.  That's the main drawback.  I bought the accessory[kit] which includes a carrying case, spare battery, and another 8Mg memory stick.  I like that they include the AC adapter with the camera.  I'm still learning and experimenting, since I've only had the camera a week.  The menus are easy to navigate.  Oh, by the way, it has a 6x digital zoom, not 2x.  That's so prominent on the packaging, I'm surprised the product specs and other reviewers misstated it.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

Best for my purposes.","Author":"Hanoch McCarty \"The Energizer!\"","ReviewID":"R103RHC82841K5","Overall":"good","Content":"I needed a quick easy to use, high quality digital camera.  I've owned five already including the Olympus D-400, D-450 and C-3030.  I think the Olympus C-3030 is very high quality but requires four PhD's to learn how to use it.  I am not an amateur.  I've taught photography and I've built 15 different computer systems over the years.  I am a professional in presentation software, for example.  The Olympus C-3030 was an expensive disappointment.  This Sony camera has great optics and --- once you spend a little time learning it --- an extremely simply menu system!  I can take pictures of clients and rapidly download them and embed them into a Powerpoint presentation.  Others have noted the flaws: the USB cable is simply 'not ready for prime time' and the 8mb memory stick is a joke.  So: if you want a great digital camera (that can do excellent 5-15 second video clips--- something I really need) then get this camera and a PCMCIA adapter [and] an extra battery and two 64mb memory sticks [and] you'll have a great system to use.  Toss the USB cable and write a letter of complaint to Sony for not providing the PCMCIA adapter.  The attached unlosable lens cap is a good idea, but an automatically hidable one (as on some other cameras) would have been better.  Including all the goodies and a case in one 'kit' would have been smart and should have been done at the same price.  Putting the microphone in front instead of on top would have been a good idea, too.  Letting the user record 60 second video clips would have been great, too. But as a usable high quality system: I currently haven't found a better one.  And as a tool to photograph the misbehaviors of neighborhood vandals, it's been proving to be a godsend.  With some specialized accessories, it sits, high in a second floor window with an external powersupply and an intervalometer plus a motion sensor.  It gets GREAT shots, even in very low light!","Date":"October 12, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great product with great features! but...","Author":"\"no_x\"","ReviewID":"R48RQUM5RNWUD","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the S70 about two months ago and I shot a lot of pictures with  it: its light weight, compact size and ease of use even with one hand (the  right of course :) ) make the perfect digital camera for ME. I was really  impressed by the quality of its pictures (colors, shades, contrast...)  although I've read a pretty bad review about it in a magazine. As many  other digital cameras, there are many features such as crop/resize a  picture, choose between 6 different resolutions, zoom in a picture (to look  for a specific detail for instance), USB connection to your PC (which is a  lot faster), optical and digital zoom (even though I don't recommend using  the digital one unless you're perfectly still), several effects (sepia,  black and white, solarize, negative and two or three others), a viewfinder  with a focus ring (very convenient at night, believe me, you can't see  anything using the LCD display)... you can even shoot a movie with it! Why  only 4 stars ? Simply because it comes with a 8Mo memory stick (come on  Sony! we can't do anything with 8Mo unless we use the 640x480 resolution!),  there is no carrying case or something to protect it and the menu is not  that intuitive... it can get pretty complicated to find what you're looking  for when you don't know your camera. However, it's still very easy to  use... turn it on, point and shoot... delete if you're not satisfied and  try again! Want to have a look at your pictures ? Turn a switch to  \"play mode\" and use the arrows of a small pad to navigate among  them, delete, resize... then just plug your USB connector to your PC and  with the driver installed, a removable disk appears on your machine, just  like a zip drive or a hard drive! Drag and drop your pictures where you  want. The stamina rechargeable battery allows you to know exactly how much  time you have. In short, I think the S70 is worth the price you pay for it  even if you'll have to buy another memory stick (around $140 for a 64Mo but  you can go with a 32Mo). It has all the features of the other digital  cameras of its range of prices plus others, the quality of the picture is  commendable (and again I'm not talking about the 3.3 megapixels resolution  which is obviously excellent but the colors, contrast...) and it's easy to  use, except for the menu. I've used it in trade shows, parties with  friends, during weekends (sceneries...), I've even taken some pictures from  a plane! Last but not least, even if I print a lot of pictures with this  camera, using a pretty good Epson printer (but not a photo printer, no need  for it), I still have a good 35mm when I want to have a professional  result. That makes sense, doesn't it?","Date":"July 24, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great beginner digicam","Author":"L. Wallach","ReviewID":"R11R4S4L2NQLNJ","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is great for the beginner digital camera enthusiast.  I got this camera as a present last Spring and enjoyed it thoroughly, taking it on a trip to Italy.  If you want to see samples, please email me and I'll send you links to these pictures.  The pictures it takes are wonderful, bright, vibrant colors, great contrast, etc.  That should be the main thing to be concerned about when starting out.  One of the best things other than the image itself was the flexible lcd viewfinder.  You can twist it around in every which way, making it ideal for taking candid shots.  Another great feature is the infolithium battery which lasts forever (the person who said he had problems with his must have had a defective one) and constantly tells you how much time you have left before it needs to be recharged.  The menu system is a snap.  The camera is compact enough to fit in a coat pocket.  Obviously for a lower-resolution, lower-end camera, you're not going to find high-end features like manual modes, etc., but you do at least have some flexibility in terms of flash and exposure modes.  Another downside, though easily fixed with some extra money is the included 4mb memory stick.  You really need more if you want to take more than a few shots.  Obviously you can decrease the resolution which increases the number of shots you can take, and although these lesser-resolution pics are clear, they may not be suitable for printing.  At the highest resolution, 4x6 prints come out nicely, but lower resolutions produce prints that are not very good.  The other side of this is that memory sticks are proprietary to Sony products.  So in order to take full advantage of the medium, your MP3 player and PDA would have to be Sony products as well, so that you could use the sticks interchangably.  Sony still hasn't learned their lesson from Betamax or Minidiscs, but that's another issue.  Yes, speed is also an issue.  It takes quite a while to take a picture after hitting the shutter release, and even longer to take another one after the shot.  As long as you don't primarily take pictures of kids (or other fast moving objects ;-) this camera is great!","Date":"December 18, 2000"}

First, a national consumer magazine rated the S30 one of the best 1.3 mega pixel cameras.  Second, you have to consider the accessories that come bundled with this camera.  You get a rechargeable lithium ion battery, an AC Adaptor, and a USB cable that when connected to your computer, makes your camera act like a hard drive.  You can even upload images to the camera so you can take them with you.  We love hooking up the camera to the TV!! The features are nearly endless, and the picture quality is very impressive.  I can't say enough about this camera.  Sony even has a rebate program where you can essentially get an extra 16MB memory stick for free.

{"Title":"I'll never go back","Author":"Spartan Fan","ReviewID":"R2LXUR6M5KZUVL","Overall":"good","Content":"I just recently got the Sony DSC-S30 and I can't put the thing down.  I think the reviewers that had problems with the battery life and the amount of pictures that can be taken possibly did not take time to read the instruction manual.  This camera has many settings that you can choose from to manipulate how many pictures you can store at a time.  Of course if you go with the highest quality you will undoubtedly get less pictures.  This can be solved by getting an extra memory stick, or going for lower grade pictures, which are still crystal clear.  This camera has many options that will make a novice photographer look like a pro.  There are many picture effects to choose from.  You can take black & white photos, sepia colored (to look old fashioned), redirect light sources and shadows, and much much more.  The movable LCD display is great, you can even turn it backwards and take a picture of yourself.  Antoher great feature that my family has used, is hooking it up to the TV.  Using this we took a self portrait with the timer and we could reposition ourselves and preview the picture by looking at the television.  Technology is so cool.  I'm glad we didn't take our salesman's advise and go with a \"starter\" camera -because we are young-, I would not have been happy.  Nobody gives you more cool options and buttons than Sony.  Great Camera- but now I wish I had gotten the DSC-S50, for the movie feature.

It  takes spectacular daytime shots, including landscape and action shots.  Low  light situations leave much to be desired.  This is one of the few reasons  I didn't give four stars.  The aperature settings are so small that it is  difficult to get low-light shots that aren't blurry.  The moonlight  settings are nice, but keep the shutter open for almost a second; if you  don't have a tripod, it is tough to hold still long enough.  Also, forget  about the 4meg card that comes with the camera, invest in at least a 32 meg  card.  I bought a 64 meg memory stick and I can take about 95 pictures at  1280X760, which is great.  I find that the space runs out at about the same  time as the batteries do under normal use, which is perfect.  I also love  the free-moving LCD screen.  It comes in handy all the time.

The best part is being able to delete unwanted on-the-fly and edit the pictures at home afterwards. The camera is easy to use for a non-techie. The battery has an incredibly long life. I bought an additional battery for my trip to Thailand and never really had to use the backup (of course, I recharged every night). Another good feature, the charger is also universal (can be used or both 110 and 220 volts). In the case of Thailand, no outlet adapter was needed. The zoom is great. Deleting photos using is a little difficult for me, I had removed the wrong photos a couple of times. My biggest complaint is that the memory stick is still quite pricey. I would like to get the 64 MB one but I am going to wait for the price to come down a little more. Also if you don't know this already, the USB port is not compatible with Windows NT. I had to get a diskette adapter for my NT laptop which requires a driver installation from the CD but the USB worked really well for my Windows 98 PC at home.

This camera is totally awesome and the pictures even look better than my friends Mavica FD-85 that he paid almost 200 dollars more for. The television out capability is awesome. Me and my wife snapped up a bunch of photos at the ski resort and came right back to the room and looked at them. The camera could use a viewfinder but I will tell you this. For the image quality, battery performance, plus the offered storage capcity through Sony's memory stick; I wouldn't have another camera. The camera is simply terrific and compact enough to be fesable to carry but not to small to be a problem to hold on to. By all means purchase at least a 32MB memory stick. For the average shot shooter, this will be plenty for you to work with. The USB feature is also a great added benefit to this camera. 900 kb/s transfer speeds blow away slower serial connections.

If you just want to take camping snaps to pass around to friends, a 32mb card gives you about 300 pics at 640x480. Higher res pics like 1024x786 give you about 80 pics. If you like effects and closeups this is the camera for you. I found it so much fun to use that I forgot all about camcorders and film. Found mine on closeout for 400.00 and another 60.00 for the 32 mb stick. Sounds like a lot of money? I Have taken over 6,000 pictures in the last 4 months  without film or proccessing fees...You do the math. Advanced controls include white balance selection, special effects, resizeing, and much more.

The flippy swivelly viewfinder is the most useful feature I've ever had on a camera hands-down. I find it very hard to ever buy a camera again, that doesn't have one.However, I really hope there's an eighth circle of hell devoted solely to the jackass who invented, for lack of a better term, the \"soft\" on/off button. For a hundred years the on/off button obeyed you. It turned something on or off at YOUR whim. There was no equivocating. Now, your computer or electronic device thinks about it for a while and without explanation refuses to fire (turn off, take the picture...) because your not in the righ mode, the camera's \"brain\" decides it not in the right mode, or that I wouldn't like the picture I'm trying to take. Who knows why? Now no matter how much you want the camera to take your freaking picture, at best your volition gets an ambiguous response; the camera may or may not obey. Most electronic cameras not have this heinous funtionality.Can you think of any more worhtless time to not obey you, than when you need a specific time-based composition that will never recur? I can't tell you how many shots I've missed because of this idiotic feature. Really! A red-hot poker up the butt for eternity is not too much to ask, for the inventor of this modern scourge.

This is my first digital camera after having a few 35mm cameras after my name. Although Digital cameras still has a while to go before having that absolute sharpness than the 35mm cameras, they are not far off. Taking pictures is almost second nature now, so wonderful not worrying about films and the cost of development (In South Africa development is not cheap). I really recommend the Sony for all Photo lovers. The LCD screen can be turned in almost every direction to make taking photos a breeze in difficult positions. I would recommend that you buy an extra Memory Stick. At least a 32MB or better a 64 MB stick, and if you are on the road a lot, buy an extra battery. (I must say the battery that Sony supplies are great, last more than 3 hours continuely and it really recharges very fast.)

{"Title":"Great Camera for price.","Author":"Ian D.","ReviewID":"R12OPFOE7QYNMY","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a great camera with a wonderful variety of features for the money. The use of this camera is intuitive - within 10 minutes I had more or less  figured it all out, and only really needed the manual for reference.  Battery life is good, with the supplied rechargeable battery. The camera  will take colour, B/W or sepia shots in a wide variety of resolutions.  Webheads may appreciate the camera's auto-thumbnail feature, where a  thumbnail image can be created and stored along with the high resolution  shot. The camera feels solid, and well, camera shaped, unlike some other  cameras I looked at. Sony did a great job here.Advice:Buy another  memory stick or 2. The 4MB supplied doesn't go very far in the highest  resolution (7 images!). Buy a 32MB (57 images) or 64 MB (~114). The memory  sticks can also be used in a few other Sony products as well, so will be a  good investment for Sony fans.Gripes:1)The camera's built in flash  isn't wonderful, and the lack of optical viewfinder means that taking shots  in the dark is guesswork, as you can't see much in the display. The higher  end DC-S70 has a viewfinder which would help here.2)The delay when  taking a shot makes this camera difficult to use for action  shots.Overall:If you want a high resolution camera for mainly daytime  non-action shots that is easy to use, feature rich, with good memory  expansion and generally well designed then buy this camera. If you expect a  lot of low light or action use, then it's probably best to shop around.","Date":"August 23, 2000"}

Otherwise, I don't think so. My Cybershot DSC-S30's battery consistently needs re-charging after 4 minutes of use. And this was fresh out of the shrink-wrap. Ample 4MB-capacity Memory-Stick? Right..Enough capacity to store an astonishing seven- Yes, SEVEN pictures. Wow. That's why Sony calls it a Memory Stick - just enough memory to photograph a stick. In sepia, no less. The people in MY tour group were amazed that a brand-new camera would need charging every 5 minutes. That Sony would sell a camera that holds only 7 pictures. And that, lacking an optical viewfinder, the LCD screen completely drains the battery in no time flat. All of which leads one to this logical conclusion: Sony Marketing devised this sorry excuse for a camera with one intent: Force the consumer to buy Sony's \"optional\" accessory package: a larger memory stick, a flimsy plastic camera case, and a \"Long-Life\" (meaning LONGER THAN 4 MINUTE) Battery. All of which explains why my salesman \"...Strongly recommended\" that I buy the accessory kit.  Had he been more honest, he might have said, \"Look,if you don't buy the OPTIONAL extras,  this camera is a total piece of trash.\" I would rate it 0 stars, but Amazon leaves that option unavailable. In the hope that my Homeowner's Insurance is nearsighted, I am scurrying up to the 3d floor balcony.

I have the older model the FD-91 and love it; the only two things I would like added were  added to the new FD-95. One was the limited flash. They have added a hot  shoe for an external flash and it now gives you the same indoor flash  quality as the old SDL cameras. The other was the somewhat low DPI. The  olderFD-91 was at 1024 x 768 the new FD-95 is way up at 1600 x 1200. With  this amount of Dpi you can print a full 8-1/2 x 11 picture that truly looks  like a photo. The new eye viewer is centered in the camera and has a wider  opening with eyeglass correction focus. The mike for Audio in located on  the front as before it was on top, and is more sensitive. I do miss the  moveable LCD for self-portraits, but not many of them taken anyway! The  steady shot is a must and was one of the best features. I used it all the  time, when you are on the10x~20x it is a must. The new FD-95 now has a date  and/or time stamping on the picture that can be used or eliminated. This  might be useful for showing the correct time or date as the file  information could be changed. The only con's I have found is the battery  charging system. I liked the old separate charger that you could charge a  battery as you are away using the camera, but then you can buy the extra  battery charger as an accessory. Now you have to leave the battery in the  camera and hook up the charging system to the camera. The other was the  video mode; it is only 15 seconds now. I liked the 60-sec. mode on the  older FD-91, but the larger format is nice. The camera style is a little  more compact and well balanced.

I was impressed with the features my friend was doing on it, and that's what got me hooked.  I looked around and did a little comparison shopping and decided on the  MVC-FD95.  I like the feel of it (feels like my old 35mm Minolta) and it  was extremely easy to use.  I feel this camera has a slew of features that  make it very attractive.  The viewfinder and the LCD screen are very easy  to work with and the menus are easy to navigate also.  The MPEG movie  feature with audio are also nice too.  Primarily I was impressed with the  1600 x 1200 image size.  Shots came out really clear and crisp.  The built  in flash is adequate but it at least lets you hook up an external flash.  Probably the downside for some (but not necessarily for me) is the floppy  disk memory, meaning you can only put approx 4 shots of hi-resolution shots  on disk before its full.  However, I look at it as not a big deal, because  floppy disks are cheap and I carry a bundle in my bag anyway.  Plus floppy  disks can go directly into your computer's disk drive (an advantage for  me). The main limiting factor could be price... .  But this camera is  extremely easy to use and I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of mine.  Sony  also has a lot more features on it that I didn't mention, but go to the  store and look (and play) with one and compare it!  Good Luck!","Date":"August 27, 2000"}

Just points and shoot.-Floppy disks are [inexpensive] and simple to manipulate. Just insert the disk, copy, and \"voil\". Some people prefer buying compact flash cards because of their size, but when they realize they have room to spare, money was wasted. -It takes excellent pictures. Bad pictures are made by the user, not by the camera.-Zoom, zoom, zoom.Cons : -I wish it could take pictures faster. -The compatibility with memory sticks is useless when their prices are so high. I end up paying 10 bucks the meg and it isn't faster with sticks. -The batteries are expensive. They are drained after more than 90 shots at 1024x768. I love to take landscape pictures and clouds as wallpaper. Buying a 3 mega pixel camera with a 3x zoom(optical) and 2x zoom(digital) is nothing compared to this one, because you can't even zoom in to see someone's face near you and you will get mad when the subject is too far away. Last words : night shots are darker than expected, but when you reduce the images' brightness, you could see more details. Go to a retailer store and see it for yourself. It may be heavy and big, but what could you expect from such a great camera. My second choice of camera would be those tiny ones with 3 mega pixel and 64 megs, because of it's size and speed.

{"Title":"Satisfied With First-Rate Camera","Author":"Andrew Boyd Moore","ReviewID":"R2Y4HP7KIARC9T","Overall":"good","Content":"Having decided to purchase a digital camera for our small architecture firm, we debated about the importance of the various features available. The two criteria which ultimately led to the FD95 were the ability to write on standard diskettes and the resolution of 2.1 Megapixels. (The diskette requirement limits the choice to Sony). Regardless of the validity of our criteria, I can safely say that we are satisfied with the purchase, having used it now for several months.The advantage of the diskettes is debatable. We like their simplicity and the ease of transfer to a computer. On the down side, the capacity is small. This is readily apparent when taking high resolution shots (four shot per disk). For job-site photos, the 30 shots per diskette capacity is adequate. As for the debate, I have heard that using a high-capacity flash memory card and a USB connection is an equally convenient method of transfer. Perhaps so. Sony does provide for the use of a \"Memory Stick\" with the FD95 with an adapter, which can then be simply inserted into a disk drive.Although the resolution is not the best available, it is more than adequate for our uses: job-site record snap shots and promotional brochure photos. For these, we use the lowest and highest resolutions, respectively.The ease-of-use is good, with the feature menus being relatively intuitive. The feature list is also impressive, though many are not particulary applicable to our needs (the video feature falls in the \"neat-o\" category). We are particarly pleased with the quality of the optics and the optical zoom capability. The camera has a nice heft and feels solidly constructed, a feature that is important in our application.One downside to the camera is its bulk, but this is directly attributable to the diskette memory feature and the professional-quality optics. Another minor criticism is the inability to control how the files are named; it would be nice to \"wildcard\" the sequnetially-numbered names with a job-specific prefix.Overall, we would recommend this camera to anyone who had similar criteria as our own. If compactness is the primary concern, look elsewhere. If you can justify the expense, consider the Sony model that writes to CD-RW.","Date":"April 8, 2001"}
{"Title":"Simplicity & Convenience!!","Author":"Ralph R. Heerens","ReviewID":"R29LAJD677MWWN","Overall":"good","Content":"We bought the camera in early December, a last minute splurge before our trip to Asia over the holidays. My only instructions came from a brief review of the manual but it was enough to take advantage of many of the features of the MVC-FD95 camera. The operation became second nature to me in no time. My wife, a true techni-phobe was able to operate it with great results with only a few seconds of instruction and felt very comfortable using it (unlike the VCR). One of the silliest (yet impressive) pictures I took on the trip was from the crosswalk between the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur of our hotel in the distance. Using the full zoom, it brought the hotel into the viewfinder and with the steadyshot activated, made the picture seem like it was taken from a block away. To appreciate the picture you would have to see the shot from that distance without the use of any zoom. I took some beautiful macro shots of orhids and other exotic flowers with unbelievable colour and clarity. The camera was a luxury for us, however I am as thrilled with it now as when I first used it and just wish I had more time to fully discover the features. I read several reviews of this and other brands and although I was a bit concerned about the size, I have had no regrets. The floppy disk system is fantastic. Take the 3.5, put it in the floppy drive of your computer and you have the images ready for posting or editing. On our trip, I used it under some extreme conditions, high humidity and temperatures without any problems. I feel very comfortable recommending this camera.","Date":"January 16, 2001"}

I have gotten excellent results from it and was surprised at how light it is despite its deceptive looks.  It's very easy to handle and operate.  I highly recommend this camera, even for a veritable novice like myself.  The only downside I have found is something that was pointed out in another review -- it is slow when taking a picture.  You really have to hold that button down to get it to take and it makes taking my hockey action shots a bit of a challenge.

You can store up to 32 pictures per disc which is close to using a 35mm camera film. I detail on the label the contents what is stored and have not had a problem with mixing pictures up. It will also allow you to film short mpeg movies of up to 5 seconds in duration.It is somewhat bulky to carry and will not fit a small camera bag. I certainly overcame the bulkiness without much problems. The menus to control the camera features are clear and easy to understand.

The camera is actually very light for its seemingly encumbering size, and while it is bigger than most cameras (due to the floppy drive), it fits quite well into my hands.  People with smaller hands may want a different camera like the Sony Cybershot.  I have taken a few pictures in different areas, outside, inside, light and dark and they all turned out great.  The 2.1 Megapixels are more than adequate for the amature photographer.  I haven't even begun to explore all the options, the self timer works great giving you 10 seconds to get into place with your friends or family before the picture is taken, and don't worry about focusing because the auto focus does a great job as well.  The main reason I picked this up over my other too choices was because the Cybershot F550 seemed to leave some blur in the pictures when I took my test shot with it, and the Olympus 2040 and 3040 just didn't have the zoom capability that I needed.  My one complaint is that the battery just doesn't seem to last long enough but I'll pick up the longer lasting battery and use the original as a spare.  Don't want to carry floppys around?  I have taken all my test photos on Floppies so far and at 1024 x 7xx I seem to be able to fit 10 pictures per disk.  I also picked up the memory stick adapter ... and a 64MB memory stick ... for when I am in a situation where disks seem to be too much of a hassle, like when I'm out on the town in Romania or Hungary or something. All in all this camera is a great buy, I highly recommend it to anyone.","Date":"June 24, 2001"}
{"Title":"Best of two worlds...","Author":"Octopusrex","ReviewID":"R23O844OJDJOTH","Overall":"good","Content":"I had bought my first camera, a Pentax, in 1965 and graduated up to the Nikon family. Being immersed in black and white processing for years and needing a new camera I weighed getting a new Nikon and all the darkroom equipment necessary for color processing.Since I am a photo hobbyist, I was unable to justify the expense of the equipment plus having to buy a new set of lenses. The Sony Mavica with its SLR viewfinder capability struck me as an ideal compromise. You are able to actually view what will be taken while the LCD allows those surreptitious candid people shots.It is great being able to down load pictures into my iMac and manipulate color balance, crop, and electronically 'dodge' the darker areas to achieve what your mind's eye saw when taking it. The Sony supplied software is a waste of a CD, though. Get Photoshop to really use the capabilities of this camera.There are a load of features which make this camera ideal for both portraiture and landscape photography. But it is also eminently suited for those quick snap shots.Having a true 10X optical zoom with a compound lens lends itself to nearly any situation . I rarely use the digital zoom although, with its higher than average CCD size and pixel count, little resolution is lost.All in all, a great camera for the ardent hobbyist as well as the casual user. It will have longevity in the digital camera field.Okay, there are two detractions to an otherwise great product... the manual leaves much to be desired and the battery charge connector is very touchy.","Date":"March 13, 2001"}

What surprised me is the incredible image quality of close-up pictures in the macro-mode.  I knew i wanted a camera that accepted floppy disks and Sony is the only company that offers this. To me, the convienence of floppy disks outweighs the need to carry multiple disks. I cant think of a downside to this camera except: 1.  Forget about taking action shots, too slow in taking picture. 2.  Flash is underpowered, lighting is critical to good shots.Those are my only complaints.  This camera offers so many user friendly features, i cant list them all here.  Pricey, but worth it.","Date":"January 11, 2001"}
{"Title":"Best Mavica to Hit the Market Yet","Author":"Frank Brunner","ReviewID":"R1TV7Y8M3F2KR9","Overall":"good","Content":"Although somewhat bulky, this Mavica has a superb set of features among which one of the most beneficial to me is the eye level viewfinder with an LCD inside which eliminates the problem of viewing the screen when in bright sun such as encountered in the tropics. The FD-95 also gives the user the ability to adjust his or her photo file size to suit their end uses as well as to maximize the average number of shots per floppy disc. Its 10X optical zoom affords greater utilization which most other cameras do not offer. Built in mic and MPEG recording capability can be useful in some situations. Compatibility of its batteries with SONY digital video cameras is another benefit to the user, reducing the number of accessories required to carry for charging them when traveling abroad.","Date":"February 7, 2001"}

{"Title":"My trip to China","Author":"Simon Said","ReviewID":"R314DFLYW063JI","Overall":"good","Content":"I took more than a thousand pictures with it in a month, until I gave it to my uncle. I only remember rechearching a battery every two days. That's how great it is.I used it outside when it was hot(it was always hot though) and it never malfunctioned. The heat may have damaged a disk or two, from my bulk of 75 pack.Let's keep things simple:-The zoom is incredible! Sometimes you see once in a lifetime shots, but they're usually far, far away. With this camera, you'll have that chance! They say that the digital zoom reduces the quality of your pics, but I don't really care and it doesn't affect significantly enough to make it lower than excellent.-My last review said \"more than 40 pics per battery\". After filling my 75 disks, it seemed to be 100 if you don't use the LCD screen too often. Why it was 40 for me? I used up a lot of juice when I was showing the pics to people. That's all.-The weight may be an advantage if you see it differently. I might use a heavier camera for a job so a 2 pound camera is nothing. If I used a lighter camera, it was much easier shaking it and ruining the pic. I took 800 pics in a week. Did I complain? Nope.-The slow speed can also be a good factor. If you had a slow camera, you would be careful to take any pictures. If you had a really fast one, you would take a whole lot more without being concerned about quality and also you need more memory. It made me a better photograph, simple as that.-The size is also a good factor. The grip is perfect. You can hold up your arm as a tripod and relax. With a small camera, you'll feel some tension after a while.-It's not a camera that can be stolen easily. If a robber grabbed it and ran away, it would slow him down and it would tire him out. A small camera, on the other hand, will be snatched and kept in a pocket. Need to say more?-I had no problem taking pics in a bus, but in a train, things may pop up by bluring anything behind. Be sure that the window is clean since usually it's dirty(the dust or filth is usually black or disgusting).Well if you asked me why you should buy it, I have to compare it with other models. First the zoom eliminates most of cameras so we have a few left. You must have a stable zoom, one out. Then you must tell me how many pics you have to take in 10 seconds. This one can take around 2.5 so it's nice for trips or anything else. I don't recommend this one if you must take a lot of good pics in a short time, but then you wouldn't need the zoom so it's up to you. I recommend compact flash or smart media so the price total will rise up quickly. The pics are bigger(around 2 to 10 times as much memory of sony mvc-95) so you must buy a lot of 128 mb cards. And finally you may have only one choice or two. Obviously, you'll find digital camera web sites and get full reviews. Forget film, digital is the way to go.","Date":"March 10, 2002"}

{"Title":"Good telephoto, not enough wide-angle","Author":"rossuk","ReviewID":"R2DU7FLC3EUU6V","Overall":"good","Content":"While I was in Jamaica I borrowed a MVC-FD95 Digital Camera. I took about 320 pics mostly at 1040x768 resolution. My thoughts: 1. Easy to use  2. It is quite light for its size.  3. It has very good telephoto facilities but the wide angle (39mm equivalent) is not really wide enough for landscapes.  4. I found that it was quite slow at taking pictures and if the shot was of a bird it had flown away by the time the camera had taken the picture.  5. I got 90 minute battery life and the recharge time was quite good.  6. Changing floppies was a pain in the rear (10 pics/floppy at 1040x768), it also has 1600x1200 resolution but you only get 4 pics to a floppy.  7. I loved the AE (shutter) mode (my real camera is a Canon AE-1).  8. It has a useful built in flash. 9. The mpeg video mode is useful (it captures the sound as well)  10. Quality of the pictures at 1040x768 was good to very good (enough for the web) Would I buy it? I would consider buying a newer model, the MVCCD1000 Digital Camera, with a three inch CD-R drive for the 3.5 inch floppy drive - vastly increasing the camera's image capacity.  I would like a wider angle model, but I will still borrow the Mavica FD95 when I go back to Jamaica.  The camera would be well suited to studio work.","Date":"May 14, 2001"}

I have experiance with many cameras, and digital is definately the way to go. The economics of it outways film cameras tremendously. I can hold over 400 photos on 100 floppy disks costing me only about $22.00 per box of 100 floppys. Try doing that with a film camera. And if you miss a shot or make a bad shot, just delete it, their's no waste. The only negitive aspects to this camera is the autofocus is quite slow for action shots, by the time it focuses and snaps the photo, the object is long gone. I have missed many shots due to this, I recommend planning action shots very carefully. The quality of the photos are very good for a 2.1 MP camera, you can make 8x10 photos with relitively good results. But if your looking for the quality like a 35mm film camera has than this isnt for you. And on occasion, you will find a floppy disk that won't format and won't hold any photos, I just ditch them and use another, the cost is very minimal. Overall this is a very good digital camera.","Date":"July 30, 2003"}

{"Title":"Best ready to print pictures camera on the market","Author":"FredD \"FredD\"","ReviewID":"RHGDFDNMG9Z31","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had a Mavica MVC FD95 for over 4 years now. It uses a diskette for storage. The reason I chose it was the built in flash, the universal ability to print, and the Zooming lense for those great Memphis Zoo panda and other animal pics when they are far away from the viewing area. There might be better cameras, but none are as easy to use and take GREAT pictures.I love the two viewing areas. I look at the view scrren and see how the picture looks. You can sit at a wedding (I actually did this)and look at the screen and decide to keep or erase the picture. The diskettes are easy to keep in a dess coat at the wedding and change. My pictures looked better than the paid professional ones the couple paid big bucks for!!!! Plus, I did a brief video with the camera of the wedding march (with sound).My buddy is a camera buff and he has a FD 75, and when I pulled my 95 out, well it psyched him out with the look and the size.Every development studio and computer accepts diskettes, so it is easy to sent to another person. This is helpful to send by mail. You know those internet phonelines will not sent pictures very fast, and many have limits to the mail size to avoid spam. Just drop a diskette in the mail and grandma with her older clunkier hand-me-down computer can see the pics of the grandkids.Now for the real techie, you can use the memory stick adaptor. I bought mine remanufactured and didnt get the adaptor for memory stick. It is a great add-on, but not essential. I'll stay with the diskettes, because they are cheaper, easy to get and easy to use in any computer.One suggestion, get an extra battery. there are used ones and clone ones now that are cheaper ($15-$22.00), so it isn't the big investment it used to be of $35. to $55.00. Sony uses the same battery in numerous products. I found the battery gave out too quick (or I used it too much).  Plus, when you use the camera, you will be in a place that a recharge is not possible, and the extra battery is a great help.My only complaint is the switch from still-to-video-to-play pops too easy from one to the other. It has really played havoc with the pictures. BUT I think that is more all thumbs me and not the camera.Suprisingly, the price of a 95 has held up well in resale. I paid maybe 60.00 more than it is re-selling for now. That is a perk, if you plan to resell after a set time of use.","Date":"March 23, 2005"}

It is not widely realized that to get double the resolution you need four times the number of pixels. So to go to 3 megapixels won't even double the dots per inch as published. I'll move up when I can get 5 megapixels for under $1000.Another factor often missed is that unless you can fill the frame, you are wasting a lot of pixels. So the zoom range is often more important than pixel count.Some of the other comments on this camera seem uninformed: I plug the PCMIA card that the camera uses to store images into my Mac PowerBook, no software, no drivers are needed. I then drag them right into Photoshop or into a folder. It's fast and easy. The same holds for PCs that can read these cards.I like this camera's good handling, true SLR nature (I wish it had depth-of-field preview, though), ability to take closeup and other lenses, and good control of exposure.

My biggest complaint here is that the focus ring is hardly available.  You can see in the photograph that the camera body actually cowls the body of the lens.  What I didn't realize until I got my hands on it was that the cowl really gets in the way.  You can't wrap your hand around it.The optical viewfinder is small and dark, the flash tends to wash out the subject when set at the higher ISO, and the drivers for the flash card needed extraordinary user intervention to work (luckily, I'm an IT person).Sounds like I hate it, right.I guess if I were less interested in resolution and ease of manual control, I'd keep this camera.  I have to say that the photographs I did take were of very high quality for a camera in this price range.  It takes very sharp images, with great color.  It's also really easy to use, and the automatic features were fairly flawless in their operation.Now, I have to spend 2 1/2 times as much to get what I really wanted.

I took several pictures with it and saved them to my PC. I returned the S50 for a couple of reasons: - I had a lot of dificulty gettingt the USB software to work - I really wanted one of the SLR type digital camerasI narrowed my selection to the Sony 770 and the Olympus E-10, and based on price I took a chance on the Sony model. After working with it for a couple of weeks, I am very dissapointed and am sending it back. On the positive side, and contrary to some of the other reviews, It was extremely easy to pop the PCMCIA card in and out of the camera and into my laptop. No drivers or software were needed. Getting pictures into and out of photoshop was drag and drop simple.I found the camera very easy to use. The remote control was a great feature when working off a tripod. The feature set was good, and the flexibility was great. Now the negative news and the reason why I am returning it.The resolution of the pictures was not up to snuff with other cameras available. I took several shots in exact same lighting and subjects as the S50, and the S50 produced superior results in terms of sharpness of image and color rendition. The 770 produces muted, washed out colors, especially in low light. Trying to take pictures at night (capturing the neighborhood christmas displays)was a waste of time.The Flash unit is sub par and not able to provide adequate light.  In fact the camera took better pictures in natural light than when using the flash. Much better results were obtained using an external flash borrowed from my 35mm camera.The resolution I guess is what you would expect from only 1.5Mpx, but there is no reason to settle for this unless you are stymied by price.Finally, I found the battery life to be totally unacceptable when using the internal flash, and the LCD. Many of the advanced features are only available when using the LCD. The batery lasted  only for 30 minutes and maybe 20 shots when using the flash and the LCD to preview results.The concept of the camera was a nice try by Sony, perhaps they will up the ante by putting one of their more advanced CCDs into the next iteration.In the meantime, I am going to have to splurge and try the Olympus E-10","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

If I was a real diehard user of digital cameras, certainly cameras above 2000.00 is where I would obviously be looking. But my DSC-D770 is great!","Date":"December 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera for the price","Author":"JC \"SQLCowboy\"","ReviewID":"R20L46CVRFZBJK","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been waiting for over a year to find a decently priced digital camera that has the feel of an SLR.  When I found this camera (at [money] at [a local store]) it fit my needs exactly.  For the price, you cannot get a better approximation of a real camera.  I'm seeing complaints about the software and pc card adapter, but it works fine for me.  The other complaints seem to be more about the camera's quality, which I'm finding is excellent if you learn something about how it takes pictures.  Adjusting the white balance is critical for indoor and night time shots, but this isn't simple.  I didn't want a simple camera though.  If I wanted point and shoot, there are plenty of other choices out there.  For the price and the features, this camera is one of the best choices out there, and you can find some incredible deals now that it isn't being produced anymore.","Date":"June 7, 2002"}

But Sony sticking with it's proprietary, over priced and underperforming \"memory stick\" instead of the industry standard Compact Flash is VERY disappointing. This junk is slower, more expensive, comes in much smaller sizes, etc. It's also too bad they they do not use batteries you can use in a standard charger, or buy off the shelf. Meaning if you're on vacation and you find the perfect picture, you'd best have saved some of the juice in the propriatary batteries. Also a 5x zoom lens is not that impressive. Why not a 7x or better? Minolta's 5 megapixel Dimage 7 does. As do several others (some as high as 10x optical)","Date":"November 8, 2001"}

{"Title":"All in one with no comprimises!","Author":"Daniel Seidman","ReviewID":"R3LQUCU8KHVJG0","Overall":"good","Content":"I was stunned when I first saw this Fujifilm camera.  I was originally looking for the Cannon Ixus, but this was smaller, very light-weight, and had a 4.3 million pixel definition!  The advantage of this is that you do not need to zoom with the camera.  It will allow for a 2400x1800 resolution, so you can zoom in on a quarter of an A4 sized picture with the software whilst hardly losing picture quality.  The Quicktime movie mode works well and is fun showing a webcam like video with sound.  Finally, it is an MP3 player which is hardly bigger than the dedicated ones.  Sound is good, the MP3 player alone is worth having, allowing you to do voice recording and pictures when necessary.  Oh, it also looks very cool!  Only drawbacks that I've seen so far are no onboard memory and the MP3 player doesn't take VBR encoded files.  I say nevermind!","Date":"September 27, 2000"}

Well all that doesn't matter. This baby rocks.First off I had no problems with mp3's, I got mine ... and stuck 'em in the 40i and off I went. NO PROBS!!This camera is tiny, it's light and it a joy to hold and use. The quality of the pictures are amazing, I took a shot of the sky just before sunset and the detail in the clouds is unreal.The 16MB supplied card is a bone of contention for me. Yes it will store 19 or so max resolution pics. But compact flash would have been the way to go Mr Fuji.The smartmedia is ok but it's wafer thin, looks like it could easily break with removing it all the time to go in a card reader and the industry seems to support the bigger CF cards. So why not Fuji?I reckon a 64meg card would give you almost 80 pics at the max setting. Maybe enough for a holiday/vacation hmmm maybe.....I did print out some pics first at max setting, then at norm setting and I couldn't tell the difference - even at 10 by 8 size so maybe a 64 meg card would do it.Anyway, this is the camera for me, I don't buy things unless I am totally happy with them and I am totally happy with this purchase.","Date":"November 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"perfect balance","Author":"Allison A","ReviewID":"R33T267CGBLE8D","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is the perfect balance between high resolution and small size. The photo's I have taken with this camera are so fantastic, that two other picky people from my office finally bit the bullet and bought one too! I have traveled the world for 13 years capturing the moment - therefore -my photo's are important to me. By the same token, if the thing is too large, I am less likely to want to drag it along. This camera is so small, I carry it with me everywhere - traveling or not. It is also easy to use with auto or manual functions if you prefer. The macro lens is great - I have used it in lieu of a document scanner in a pinch. I carry a couple of spare rechargeable batteries (extra 5 bucks) so I am never out of juice and the smart media cards are only limited by MB = hundreds of pictures on one card. Another important consideration is the time it takes the camera to record the shot. Some digitals have more megapixels but are too slow to record initially or between shots. This one is as fast as a film camera. To sum it up - this camera takes beautiful pictures, is easy to operate, fast to act, and small enough to carry in a pocket while skiing. Top this off with ?Ofoto? (Amazon's photo printing service) and the results are amazing - worth framing. If this baby ever dies--> I will buy another one!The digital video is fun for short takes with sight and sound that can be replayed on the camera. I have never used the MP3 function and I do not care if I ever do.Best of luck on your camera hunt. From Venice to the Swiss Alps to New Zealand, this is my choice. _ams","Date":"November 25, 2001"}

Last time I looked Amazon was selling it [price] dollars for 128 meg. Nice! My wife has her eye on this beauty and now she wants one, so I ordered the metallic blue model. The movie function is nice and includes sound but I really don't use it. I noticed that although the movies have an .avi extension windows media player won't play them but quicktime does. ....

If you look through the viewfinder, and your subject is only taking up a tiny fraction of the display, YOU're the one that's going to have to physically move yourself closer to the subject.  The camera cannot do the zooming-in for you.And secondly, the shutter speed is far too slow.  Trust me, you cannot take photos of, say, people dancing.  All you'll get is a blur.Oh, and why Fuji neglected to include the AC Adapter as part of the package is beyond me.  Supplying two rechargeable batteries, which take about 13 hours to charge simply isn't on...That aside, it is a good little camera.  TV-Out is more of a gimmic than something you'll use regularly, as the pictures look very fuzzy, even on a decent TV.  And it's very very easy to use, and produces very good photos.But personally, I'd think twice about going for this camera over, say, the Canon Ixus V.","Date":"May 19, 2002"}

The major advantages for me have been it's size, picture quality and, of course, the very handy digital video recording functions. I would definately recommend it to friends because, in my opinion, it's the best all round performer. OK, with that out of the way, I have one major problem with the video function: Having used the camera on a regular basis, I've found myself recording more and more videos. I now have 2 64meg cards to support my habit. The videos are saved as .avi files which I thought would be ideal to send to friends to view the videos. Unfortunately, if the video is double clicked on a standard Windows PC it does not act as a standard .avi file and it cannot be viewed ie it can only be viewed either from within the Exif Viewer software (supplied with the camera) or by opening Quicktime then opening the file itelf. I'm happy to be proved wrong on this. I've tried renaming the file to .mov so that it can be recognised by Quicktime and I've also tried changing the file associations in Explorer so that the file is viewed by the standard .avi viewing software. When the file is double-clicked in Explorer a connection to the net is made to attempt to download the appropriate decompressor (which, of course, fails). My suggestion is simple - if the file generated is indeed given a .avi extension, can it be viewed as any other .avi please? I'm sure that there's a very good reason why this occurs but try explaining it to the average Joe who tries to view the video without Exif Viewer or Quicktime.","Date":"March 14, 2001"}

It has been the ultimate device to have for traveling & vacation, especially when visiting museums where you can use all the functions - still camera, video, and MP3 player.Those who wrote less than favorable reviews, seemed to have higher expectations of this camera than what was advertised. If you want to take professional quality photos, have lots of little buttons and settings on the camera to play around with, and be able to zoom in on distant subjects, then just buy a digital camera that has those features. Or those who expect more from the MP3 player, like ID3 tag support and being able to fast forward through songs, should just buy an MP3 player that has these options. After a year of using this camera I found I don't care about ID3 tags.I think the only legitimate complaint people should be posting are about it's reliability problems. I recently had a problem with the automatic shutter door not closing, so I have to send it in to be repaired - so 1 star off for that.

BUT, if you are someone who likes to tweak the photos in your image-editing software when you get home, be aware that you'll be working from JPEG originals. This is not ideal, as JPEG is a 'lossy' format, meaning that when you save the edited image, you lose quality. I tried to compensate for this by shooting at the camera's highest quality setting and editing down from that; but the result was still a 2nd gen. JPEG with the typical flaws starting to show.

{"Title":"Great expectations 95 % fulfilled...","Author":"Ken Cook","ReviewID":"R2Z4XD84A85BE5","Overall":"good","Content":"I've read several reviews of the Kodak DC4800 and agree with most of the positive reviews and very little of the negative ones...Now, prospective  wise, this is my very first digital camera so I can offer my opinion with  no previous digital camera experience.  I have used several upper high end  35mm cameras in my life and do know a little more than your average  shooter; with that in mind, I will continue with my review.First of all,  I got much more than I actually expected.  All of my enlargments and prints  have been done on my HP Deskjet 970CXI printer with Kodak Glossy Inkjet 45  pound paper...some were enlarged and printed from the lowest megapixel  level (.8) and others were done with the highest megapixel (3.1)  The  results have been much better than expected...the color was terrific and  the detail was excellent.  The only pictures I took which I considered  below excellent quality were, for the most part, due to my mistakes  regarding settings, movement when shooting in low light and perhaps greater  expectations from the flash than you would normally get with a good 35mm  camera...now, a couple of the reviews have mentioned that the flash and  focus when taking pictures inside or with low light were far below the  quality they were expecting.  They may well have a point, however, I  attributed these lower quality shots more to my inexperience with the  camera and wrong settings than I actually was willing to blame on the  camera....when I became more familiar with the limits of the camera, I was  able to overcome 95 % of my original poorer quality shots...in other words,  when I actually understood the limitations of the camera, I was able to  take much better photos with clearly focused shots and excellent  color...Now, a word about expectations;  I never really counted on any  camera giving me 100 % of everything I expected...it just isn't reality.  Different cameras within different price ranges simply are not going to hit  our needs 100 % of the time.  With my zero level experience with digital  cameras and years of amateur level 35mm work, I simply was willing to  forgive a few shortcomings if I got what I consider excellent pictures 95 %  of the time.Some have commented on the lame flash which is built into  the camera...I never actually expected a lot from it so I was not  disappointed when the shots taken from more than ten feet were not as good  as one might expect.  On the other hand, the camera does have a connection  to attach a higher end external flash unit so I would tend to think that  even this objection might be overcome if one were to use a good external  flash unit.  I would be interested in hearing some reports. Like any other  camera shooting in low light, if it drops to a longer shutter speed, you  had better keep it still or go to a tripod for more stability.  I actually  attributed a couple of my poor shots to this rather than a focus problem.  Having said the above, I do consider myself a novice digital photograpy  buff, however, I can tell you, if you want a camera which is a whole lot of  fun and gives you excellent options to venture more into creative control,  I  would consider getting one.  If, however, you are expecting an end all,  do all, camera, I seriously doubt if you can find one on the market.  Perhaps the extremely high end professional cameras can give you lots of  what your looking for, however, I tend to think that even they have  limitations...","Date":"September 19, 2000"}
{"Title":"advanced point and shoot","Author":"Nick \"ndoble\"","ReviewID":"R36I08W73C4NAX","Overall":"good","Content":"This is Kodak's entry into the 3 megapixel market (and some reports indicate that this is the first of Kodak's digital cameras to be designed  by Kodak Japan), and considering that Kodak did so well at 2MP with the  DC280, one expects a formidable digital camera, and gets it, for the most  part.  This is my second Kodak digital camera and I've continued to  purchase Kodak because with digital cameras the camera is also the film and  no one knows how to make film quite like Kodak, a la Kodachrome.  The  previous DC280 is a point and shoot camera only, and while the DC4800  offers manual control of many functions, it still basicaslly a point and  shoot camera - for instance, with the DC4800 no control of focus is  possible, and if you want to change shutter speed you have to go through  several levels of menu (no less than 10 button presses to get to the  shutter speed menu and then as much as another 12 to choose the speed).  Hopefully, as the digital era progresses digital cameras will become more  like the SLRs of old with manual control of every function and all the  controls on the body of the camera, rather then buried deep in menus.  (I  understand Olympus is about to release its E10 which is like a digital SLR;  however the price will be about $2000.)That given, lets examine the  Kodak DC4800.The positives -For me, after the 3MP resolution and the  3X lens, what impresses me most about the DC4800 is the high quality, high  contrast, high resolution, high brightness backpanel LCD, which is now  truly useful, unlike that on the DC280.  The backpanel controls have also  been improved somewhat with a 4 axis \"joy\" button. The camera has  a strap post on each side of the body so one can use a neckstrap; the  wide/telephoto control is a \"wiggle\" switch under the thumb; and  the viewfinder has a diopter control for those of us needing glasses.  The  DC4800 communicates with the computer through USB only (and unlike the  DC280 can be used at the same time as other USB devices) and acts just like  a flash card reader appearing to the computer as a external, removable  drive, with the fast downloading of a reader.  The front of the DC4800 lens  is well protected, unlike the DC2800.  The manual is typical Kodak well  done, but strangely enough, as with the DC280 manual, the markings in the  viewfinder are not explained.  Exposure after pressing the shutter button  in almost instantaneous and despite the larger file size of a 3MP file,  saving the the file to the CF is considerably faster that the DC280.  Digital zooom is surprisingly good, thanks to the 3MP high density.The  negatives -I was very surprised to find that the lens barrel appears in  the lower right corner of the viewfinder at 28mm; I don't know if this is  not unusual for a point and shoot as I've never owned one before, but I  come close to finding it unacceptable.  The battery situation with the  DC4800 is not much improved so far as I can tell, even though the camera  uses an expensive (proprietary?) Kodak lithium-ion battery; the user will  surely have to invest in a $80 battery and charger kit if extended and  away-from-the-home use in anticipated.  Like the DC280, the battery cover  of the DC4800 can be knocked open by a blow to the bottom of the camera  body - those comtemplating active use should secure the battery cover with  tape.  The DC4800 is supplied with only a 16MB CF card and the buyer can  expect to spend an additional $200+ on a large CF card, which along  with  the $80 extra battery and charger will amount to an additional $300+  investment.  The camera acts only as a CF reader and is not TWAIN  compliant, which leads to lots of inconveniences in saving files.  The  backpanel LCD gets dark in sunlight.  As with the DC280, the tripod mount  is plastic and apparently not intended for serious use.One additional  comment - those buying a digital camera should check back with the  manufacturer for updated firmware - in Kodak's case there were lots of  early complaints about battery life problems with the DC280 which were  largely solved with later firmware.","Date":"August 25, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent camera","Author":"Rick","ReviewID":"R2X7F0029TBRN","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading some of the negative reveiws, I felt I had to respond. Having used and tried many digital cameras including the Canon 3030 and Nikon 990, I can tell you that for the price you cannot buy a better camera.  The problems with focusing that people complain about is that they probably did not have the focus set properly.  There is a macro and infinity setting that has to be set correctly. I know because I had that problem at first but it was my fault. I use the camera in the OR all the time and NEVER have a problem with the focus. As far as the batteries, Kodak did it right. I can easily take 40 high quality pictures using the LED without recharging and the batteries are less than half the weight of 4 AA batteries. The Canon doesn't even include rechargeable batteries for $999. The controls are so user friendly that I can show the nurses how to take great pictures for me in 2 minutes.  Try that with the Canon which is way too confusing or even the bulky Nikon 990. I don't understand the \"problem\" with the flash - it works well to 10 ft which is all it was meant for.  The best part about the flash is that I can take pictures from 1 ft away and not overexpose the picture. All in all, it is a great compact 3 megapixel camera at a great price.","Date":"October 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"Absolutely great camera","Author":"Jamie Roberts","ReviewID":"R2U30VS2IJBGHF","Overall":"good","Content":"First off--I'm spoiled, photographically: for years I've loved using good 35mm Minolta, Nikons and large format film cameras, mainly as an amateur photographer, but also as a freelance from time to time. When I took the digital plunge, I thought this camera would be more of a supplement to my other cameras. I was wrong--now I usually take the Kodak with me and leave the others behind. In short, this is just a great camera, which I've had for about two months now. It can be a bit complex to set up, and on \"Program\" the results are predictably just OK, but once you use it like a film camera the results are incredible. The control over many photographic settings--and the way Kodak has translated digital controls into \"35mm film\" settings(like ISO settings, effective focal lengths and such)--is simply fantastic. It's small enough to take with me when a full-blown 35mm Nikon setup is just too bulky (like when I'm biking); it also produces pictures that rival the 35mm. At first, I thought the indoor flash was a bit weak; you can hook up another set of flashes, however, for serious lighting. More importantly, I also found that when I set the camera properly for flash (fill works well, for instance), and proper ISO settings, that I got much better results. The macro and distance settings are effective as well, though I'm not sure why you need the distance setting with an autofocus camera. Flaws? Only in packaging--I wish that Kodak had included a case and neutral lens filter, but that's a very small complaint.","Date":"November 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Awesome Camera - Get the Firmware Update though","Author":"Jonathan Pace","ReviewID":"R3CG4SD1ZABD1P","Overall":"good","Content":"I received this camera friday afternoon, and by sunday night I had taken 200 pictures.  Let me tell you, this camera is AWESOME.  One word of caution though, GET THE FIRMWARE UPDATE FROM KODAK.COM as SOON as you get the camera.  The update fixes an autofocus issue that can leave some lower light and indoor pictures grainier in appearance than they should. Also, buy the battery and charger.  The charger will fully charge a battery in about an hour, while the the camera/AC adapter takes over four.  It is very nice to have that extra battery too.  Also, splurge and get a bigger cf card too, 16MB just doesn't cut it anymore. I admit, I am a camera novice.  Still, this camera will deliver the goods in full automatic mode.  The LCD is well readable in direct sunlight and the ON-TO-SHOOT time is the best I've seen.  This is a truely great little (and light) digital camera.","Date":"February 26, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great price vs performance deal","Author":"SH in Tampa \"SPH\"","ReviewID":"R38KBXHKK5VVSC","Overall":"good","Content":"After shopping around, I found the Kodak DC 4800 to be the best price versus performance deal on a mid level digital camera.  The hi quality picture (3.1 MP), USB transfer, manual vs automatic settings and powerful lithium ion battery are usually found on much more expensive cameras.Obviously for any camera buff image quality is paramount.  The DC 4800's high resolution pictures will blow up to 8x10 easily, and even up to 11x14 with a good quality shot.  There are a large number of controls that allow the user to adjust for a particular look (saturated color, neutral color, b&w, filtered) or for unique lighting.  We found that the image quality on this camera was excellent compared to the other digital cameras that we tried out.  Some of our shots showed some aliasing (jagged lines) in compressed modes.  However, it disappeared once the images were shot in uncompressed mode (and without digital zoom).  As noted by other reviewers, getting the firmware upgrade from the kodak website is important for the quality of low light shots.Another important feature is ease of use.  The camera software is easy to install, the manual is well written and the placement of most common shot settings on a dial on top of the camera is very helpful.  I wanted simple point and shoot, which this camera easily supports.  On the other hand, my girlfriend is a commercial artist and wanted to be able to operate with manual settings on a traditional camera.  Both of us are very happy using the camera.The only negatives are lack of twain compliance, the small memory card and the long battery charging time:- TWAIN is an industry standard interface that will allow you to connect your camera directly to numerous photo imaging software packages.  This is not supported by the DC 4800 so most file transfers are a two step process. - A 16 MB compact card will only hold 10-15 images with standard compression.  ... The battery charger takes four hours.  A faster charger is available with a second battery but again it costs a little muchOverall, this was a great deal (note it pays to shop around as the price on the camera varies greatly) for a camera that will grow with your experience.  From day one, you will get great quality shots and as you become more confident, you can manually adjust many functions to produce your own look.","Date":"March 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"Wonderful Camera","Author":"Pamela J. Wiseman","ReviewID":"R1W82LLMHZVVKK","Overall":"good","Content":"I have shot 35mm for decades.  A few years ago I got tired of lugging my SLR outfit around and started using good quality P&S autofocus cameras which did a generally good job but fell short in flexibility and indoor flash capabilities.  I tried out a Kodak DC 215 last Fall to see if digital was for me. I really liked the advantages of digital, but realized I needed a 3-megapixel camera to get the quality I wanted.  The DC 215 also offered no more flexibility than my P&S cameras.  I narrowed my choices to the Kodak DC 4800, the Olympus C-3000 and the Nikon Coolpix 880.  I finally bought the Kodak due to the current pricing.  I feel this is the best bargain in a 3-megapixel camera right now.The DC 4800 actually provides all the needed traditional film camera flexibility I want in a much more manageable outfit than my old SLR.  When you register the camera on the ..., they will send you a ... lens adapter free.  I plan to get the telephoto lens and with the built in zoom lens I will have nearly all the focal lengths I had with my SLR's three lenses and  2X tele-extender -  all in a form factor that fits in a fanny pack.  I downloaded the firmware version 1.04 and have had no trouble with low light focusing.  I have had excellent results with picture quality and my results continue to improve as I learn to use all of the camera's features.  There has been some criticism of the flash.  The DC 4800's flash capabilities are at least as good as my P&S cameras, which I realize is ... with faint praise, but this camera's features allow you to easily overcome this limitation.  Here's what you do: Buy an inexpensive tilt head automatic flash ( I got the Vivitar 2000, under ... at the country's largest retailer), and then purchase a flash shoe bracket that attaches to the tripod mount on the camera.  This costs ... for a straight bar or about ... for an L bracket.  If your local camera store doesn't have these, they are available on-line.  Plug the flash into the camera's flash terminal.  The extremely handy f-stop selection dial can be set to 5.6 for straight flash or 2.8 for bounce flash (I have always had better results with bounce).  One caveat: As the lens zooms in, the f-stop setting will close down somewhat - I find you can zoom 1x to 1.3 x before this happens.  Usually indoors this is not a problem as you can move closer to your subject instead of increasing the zoom.  Bottom line is I get the same flash quality and convenience as on my SLR for only a ... investment - try this on most consumer digital cameras!","Date":"April 17, 2001"}

If you know how to take pictures, you'll really appreciate the way this camera enables you to control aspects like shutter speed that most digital cameras insist on controlling themselves.I took pictures in total darkness (with the flash of course) and they came out perfectly.  I took low-light shots with a longer shutter setting (no flash) and those came out well too.  I took action shots, still shots, light-saturated, low-light, indoor, outdoor, with people, with distant scenery, and more...  All came out as well as could be expected from any analog camera.The USB connection is fairly straight-forward though it could use a better user interface.  The battery does get drained pretty quickly, so you can't just leave the camera on as you walk around on a tour.  But it's only flaws (besides a cheap lens cap) can be fixed with an extra battery and larger compact flash.  All around though, I haven't seen a digital camera yet that can even compete.","Date":"January 22, 2001"}
{"Title":"Superb digitial camera with very few flaws","Author":"ira_nyc","ReviewID":"R1FNKL3GRYFCC2","Overall":"good","Content":"PROS: Vivid colors, astonishing picture quality and details, great design and ergonomics, USB connectionCONS: Battery drains fast, bad focus in low-light conditionsKodak's DC4800 gives you easy access to manual functions, offers a direct USB connection to download photos to desktop and notebook, more sturdy than other cheap cameras, accurate colors that rivals film cameras. Having access to higher resolutions (such as 3.1 mega pixels) is is important as well, b/c you want your picture to be sharp and crisp. Ergonomics are great and your hands will feel at home when using it!  The casing feels very solid, but the two plastic doors (for connectivity and the memory card) looks like they could break at any time. Here are the functions accessible manually:  - Self-timer: to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself.  - Burst mode: to take 4 pictures in sequence (at the lowest picture quality, you can take up to 16).  - Landscape: to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus.  - Close-up: To let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0.7-2.3 feet in great details.  - Flash and flash settings: Will let you chose between flash, no flash, red-eye  - Exposure compensation (from -2 to +2): This will let you chose to over- or underexpose your subject, to adapt to various light conditions.  - Aperture (f/8, f/5.6, f/2.8): You can decide on the depth of field, so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos. You can also choose P for the automatic settings to take over.  - Zoom in/out: You get a 3x physical zoom, and also a 2x digital (which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough). You could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode, to prevent yourself from using it (I have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom... they're always grainy, not only with the Kodak's digital zoom, but with all those I tried). The Kodak DC4800 comes with a 16 mb Compact Flash memory card, which is a complete nonsense for a 3.1 mega pixels camera. You should buy at least 64 MB. Amazon has great prices on this.The BAD part of the DC4800 is its inability to focus in low-light conditions. It rarely focuses on the subject but looks for any source of light and focus at that point.The main complaint with the DC4800 goes to the battery.Kodak's proprietary Li-Ion battery that's used in the DC4800 doesn't impress at all. With the LCD on, it doesn't last more than 40 pictures, after which the LCD turns itself off. Get a charger and solve your problems. ALL digital cameras have their shortfalls, but this one has the least. It's simply amazing when you consider the price!","Date":"March 28, 2001"}
{"Title":"Nearly perfect","Author":"Keith Micoli \"Keith Micoli\"","ReviewID":"R1V8MLDJ9WWWN3","Overall":"good","Content":"First of all, all the great reviews here and on other sites for this camera are well-deserved.  I will not waste more time repeating what others have said, except to say that the flash works as well or better than any point and shoot 35mm I have used before.  However, the flash does tend to wash out color, which you can compensate for by manually adjusting the white balance, which is excellent on this camera, or by not using a flash and taking a longer exposure.  I recommend the latter, and was very surprised at how sensitive the camera was in fairly low light.  Certainly far more sensitive than my P.O.S. film camera.  Battery life is a big issue for all dig cams, and I would say that if you do nothing to save battery life, you get about 2-3 hours of continuous use from one charge.  If you turn off the LCD and dont use the flash, you will extend this a great deal.  I am not sure how much more life this gives you, as the battery never ran out when I did this, but it is at least four hours.  Your expectations for the battery should be similar to a laptop or a camcorder, and this battery works as well or better than most.  As for complaints about the lens cap not attaching to the camera body, you dont have to be MacGuyver to figure out that a piece of string about 8 inches long should solve this problem. Pros:  easy use right out of the box (after 4 hours to charge the battery), excellent manual, super images, fast download to PC, image control (white balance, exposure, aperture, color saturation, uncompressed TIFF option for really high res).  Able to accommodate additional lenses with the adapter that you get free for registering the camera.  Price is a plus, esp. now with the $100 rebate.  Shop around and you can find this camera for... after rebate. Cons:  memory card is comically, if not criminally, insufficient.  At max resolution, one picture will be 9MB.  The included card is 16MB.  To state the obvious, this would give you ONE pic at max res.  Using minimal compression, files are ~2MB.  What is the point of having 3MP power if you cant use it?  You need a bigger memory card, the EZ upgrade comes with a 64MB card and an extra battery for less than the price of the card alone.  NB, the battery charger is not included in this package.  The included software is not very good, to be kind.  It is functional if you have no alternative, but I would say that Photoeditor is far superior and Photodeluxe or photoshop are too superior to even compare.  Also, the camera software is not compatible with windows NT.  You can buy a card reader for pretty cheap to overcome this, which you might want to buy anyway to avoid always connecting/disconnecting the camera from the PC. Overall:  Buy this camera with the extra battery, charger, and larger memory and you will probably have no complaints.","Date":"March 13, 2001"}

It offers quite a bit of creative control to the more advanced photographer.Quite frankly, short of buying a $6,000 Kodak professional digital camera, this is the best deal I found.3x optical zoom is a definite selling point.  Never believe digital zoom ratings on cameras, while they might enlarge the image, they lose clarity and sharpness.  Most other cameras out there offer 2x optical, and 3x digital.  This camera has 3x optical, and 2x digital.  A definite advantage.The Li-ion battery is an advantage and a disadvantage.  It has a nice long life, and it is certainly more environmentally friendly).  It is definitely cost effective, digital cameras eat batteries.  But, there is one problem.  It is not easy to just pick up and charge on the road.  If you plan on taking the camera away from power outlets, buy a spare battery and charger.  With regular batteries, any newstand can sell them to you.  The spare battery isn't cheap.

All I can say is these people must have gotten a lemon from the first day of the assembly line or something. I bought the 4800 and it is awesome. The autofocus on mine was the first thing that impressed me when I looked at the output. It has not occured to me it has ever made a mistake. The depth of field is impressive. The thing is laid out perfectly and fits my hand like a glove.  The low light capability is like a spy camera out of a movie. The pictures, the most important thing, which come out of this camera are very very nice.The default color choice out of the box I guess is suppose to emulate kodachrome. Sometimes it is a little too much, but the camera has a easy override which takes neutral coloration pictures when you want them. I think people and their clothes look better with the saturated color on but when you need accurate color it can be yours immediately. The zoom has a stop before it gets to the digital, it isn't that hard to detect it for me. The flash works with the auxiliary lenses which block the nikon 990.I will say that while the flash is not physically blocked with any of the auxiliary lenses, the professional quality wide angle lense is very large and does cast a shadow on wide angle shots of art work in the lower right corner from a distance of three or four feet. How many times  you use wide angle lenses in a dark room from four feet with the flash will determine how big a problems this is. The camera has such good low light capability you can, I feel, get around this.The batteries are suppose to be expensive. Why? because they allow you to shoot, with the LCD ON, 40 pictures or so without a problem. The cheap AA batteries belong on a cheap camera. This is suppose to be a nice camera and have a power system that has some oomph. It does. This camera should be about 1100 dollars with the other top prosumer cameras. That it costs only what it does is the achievement to fixate on.","Date":"October 5, 2000"}

{"Title":"simply amazing!","Author":"Amazon Customer \"kestrel99\"","ReviewID":"R2KTG40GDER48A","Overall":"good","Content":"I've only had this camera for a week, but I'm extreamly happy with it.  For basic point and shoot on low energy setting, it seems to do very well  with battery life.  But no matter, definitely buy an extra batter with  charger (you can get it directly from Kodak if you can't find it here).I  agree with a previous reviewer where the extended lense is visible through  the viewfinder.  I haven't received my extra lenses yet (wide angle, tele,  closeup), but I'm sure that will be even more of a problem with those.  I  suspect with lense attachments this is not uncommon.  In those cases you  may want to use the LCD screen for direct through the lense viewing  anyway.The 3.1 megapixel resolution is really, really nice.  I can't  believe I ever lived without it.  When you printout a large format image,  you can really see the difference.  This aspect of course will be true of  any 3.x MP camera.  By the way, somewhat unrelated, don't bother using the  digital zoom.  The optical one is excellent, and for digital zooming, it's  better to do the very same effect in Photoshop where you have better  control.  I just turned that effect off on my camera which is a real nice  thing to be able to do by the way.The real excitement, however, happens  when you venture into any of the manual settings.  You have really nice  control over white balance (e.g. setting Kelvins directly or adjusting  based on known lighting, or adjusting based on a white card in the image,  etc.), over color modes (sepia, B&W, several color modes), exposure  metering, ISO, exposure settings, and shutter speeds.  I think Kodak has  done a real good job with these.  It also puts some of the settings  physically on the camera so you can adjust them without going into the menu  (on the LCD screen) including f-stop, exposure compensation (handy to  quickly deal with backlight subjects), distance/closeup (which forces a  fixed focus), delayed snap, and burst mode.  The burst mode is really cool,  but I find it only interesting when using in the smallest resolution  (1080x720) where you get a burst of 16 pictures.What can I say, this is  really fun.  When my wide angle attachment arrives, I will also venture  into using this along with my kaidan attachment for VR photography.  The  software is pretty reasonable and allows full control by an attached laptop  in those professional situations where you're taking thousands of images  for a VR tour.  By the way, the included AC adapter will be a life saver in  that case too.  Also, if you really want to get exotic, Kodak makes all of  the software development kits free so you can develop your own software to  manage the camera or the resulting collection of images.  But that is  probably going a bit far for most people.","Date":"September 2, 2000"}

That problem is gone with the DC4800. Sure, you can still take an automatic picture, but expect similar results that of its predecesors. Flip it to manual and experiment a little, this camera can deliver a picture that will rival the best that 35mm can offer. Simply awesome! Also in regards to batteries, standard AA would certainly have been cheaper but can not provide the same longevity or power capabilty that a lithium can provide (How many laptops do you see running AA batteries?)With lithium batteries, this camera can process three times as fast as my DC290. Bottom line, the difference between this camera and other Kodak cameras is that this one will take a little longer to figure out and seems to be geared for the serious amateur, but is definitely worth the extra time and money. I simply love it! If you are looking for an automated DC, I prefer the DC290, it seems to provide a better overall consistent shot for this mode.","Date":"October 12, 2000"}

The viewfinder sits slightly on an awkward position but I don't find it irritating and one can still use the back panel display to preview the image. Picture quality is great at 3 MP and even good when working at lower resolution -yes sometimes we have to go there-.  The lition-ion battery is a great feature, and makes the whole camera lighter, easier to use (you can recharge when ever you want) and one gets a lot more battery life out of these babies, than normal nickel metal hydrates. Just for interest sake on one occasion I took 90 picture, with the flash on, with one battery.

{"Title":"My first Digital camera","Author":"Jeff","ReviewID":"R37VHKK71ANCUI","Overall":"good","Content":"I would like to start out by saying this is my first experience with digital photography. For the last 30 years, I have used a 35MM Nikon F with the FTN meter. After doing research to determine which camera I thought would fit my needs, I purchased the Kodak DC4800. Before going on my vacation, I also purchased a 128 MB flash card and the extra battery and charger. While on vacation I took 101 pictures with about a third to one half with using the flash. I then came home and downloaded the pictures into my PC 3 or four times before saving them to my hard drive. During this time, I never changed or recharged the battery and had no problems at all. As of yet I have not tried the external flash. I strictly wanted to find out what the camera by itself would do. At this point, I am very impressed with the ease of how the camera works and the ability to control all of the many settings and not have to be a programming wizard to do it. With just a little effort and playing with the buttons, you can just about figure everything out without even using the manual. This camera is very user friendly. I would also like to mention even with being very light it seems to be well constructed. This camera is easy to hold and the buttons for the different controls all seem to be just where you would want them. I did have a little problem with the focusing, but after realizing the camera needed to be set on the distance setting for almost all shots and downloading the new software off the Kodak web site this problem has been taken care of. Letting the camera program everything gives me very good results and takes all the work out of picture taking. This leaves me with just the fun aspects, frame point and shoot... It is nice that if I get into special situations though I can still take control of all the settings if I think it becomes necessary. Bottom line is it easy to use, gets great pictures, and I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.I would like to add this information that might help in purchasing this camera. At the default setting of 3.1 MP the resolution is 2160 X 1440. This is an approx. file size of 960 KB. That means you are going to get just a little over one picture per MB. So a 65MB card = 65 pictures or 128MB card = 128 pictures. I recieved a 16MB card with my camera and sixteen pictures just doesn`t get the job done. I purchased a 128MB and think this was a wise investment for me. When ordering a camera just figure about how many pictures you want to be able to take without changing cards or downloading and that will tell you what size card you need to purchase to accommodate your needs.One more thing I would like to add is that when you take a picture it is not like useing a regular camera. You push the button to take the picture half way down to set the focus and exsposure, the press it all the way down to take a picture. If you press the shutter all the way down in one complete movment your pictures will be out of focus and the exsposure will also be wrong. This is one of the few things I had to read the manual on to find out how to do correctly. Somehow I think that a lot of the problems people have (if not all) could be eliminated by spending some time learning how to use the camera correctly. It is different from a 35MM or a plain point and shoot camera. Like I mentioned in the title , this is my first digital camera after using a 35MM for 30 years and I think it works great.... YES I DID TAKE TIME TO EXSPERIMENT WITH IT before comming to my conclusion. If I had made a quick judgement before learning how the camera works I would not have rated very high.Again I would like to say that I am very pleased with this camera. GO BUY ONE!!!!","Date":"July 4, 2001"}

As some of my coworkers say, \"When you view the photograph, \"You'll find things on your skin that you never knew existed.\" I am impressed with this camera, as it has served me well for a couple of months now.

It is VERY fast, you can  take several pictures in a row before buffer fills, and it is a very simple  to use product.But dont be fooled by its size, this monster has enough  manual features to substitute a studio cam.  Camera is very sturdy,  comes with everything you need, and in fact includes the great Arcsoft  Panorama maker software, which is not mentioned anywhere.  It created  stunning panoramas and 360 degree views.Complains:  16Mb is too little  RAM.  However, camera price is relatively low compared to all other 3 MPX  ones.  Would recommend to get the expansion pack with it, which includes  an extra battery, charger and a GREAT camera bag with enough space for all  cables, accessories, etc.","Date":"August 31, 2000"}

It was a great little camera for taking candid and vacation photos that I could print at 3.5 x 5 or 4 x 6 on my Epson 740 printer with excellent results. Based on this experience, when I started shopping for a higher resolution camera, I gave Kodak serious consideration. The DC4800 was the latest in the Kodak line at the time. I ended up buying this camera due to my previous experience with Kodak and a trade-in offer for my old camera. I wish I had kept my old camera! This camera does take great photos -- if you only ever take photos in bright outdoor light!! The flash is TOTALLY inadequite for the camera, if I shoot 20 pics indoors, I am lucky if 2 come out usable...the others are too blurry. The bluriness is caused by either low light conditions, or the subject being closer than 3-4 feet from the camera. ... My suggestion? Do NOT buy this camera! I might consider one of the newer Kodak easyshare cameras, but I would read all the reviews carefully before considering another Kodak after this experience.","Date":"January 6, 2003"}

The camera stopped working once again after the third use, but since it was out of the 30-day repair warranty, Kodak would only offer another $150 repair or an upgrade to one of their other cameras with a trade in.

I owned all  the Kodak digital's starting with the 210 and ending with the 290. I to  wanted a digital with 3 plus million pixels of resoulution so I patiently  waited for the release of the 4800. What a disappointment it was when the  first of three came. Yes I had three and all three were returned due to  results mainly but poor design also enetered into the decision. First it is  to small, 2nd has a lens cap that cannot be attached to the camera even  though it has two holes in the lens cap. Batteries are expensive and don't  due any more than the AA Recharable's the 290 used. Flash is a pop up flash  which is just one other thing you have to remember to activate if needed  instead of being intergrated like the 290 was. But the real bottom line is  the results -they are not as good as the 290. I had taken a week before  with the 290 pictures of my new car. I took the same picture with the 4800  and then printed both off with the Epson 900. The 290 print was far better  than the 4800 and that is not acceptable especially with a 3.1 res. I now  own a Epson 3000Z which is built along the lines of an SLR and the results  are what I expected from the 4800. The Sierra Image software included is  great. Kodak had the best in the 290-all they had to do was improve the 290  with increased resolution and they would have had another winner.","Date":"September 9, 2000"}

Most high and low numbers (f/stops and lens sizes in mm) are exaggerated.  The only thing it does well is take pictures of fruit bowls and [use] up electricity.  It has no freeze frame due to excessive high available light required by the CCD. Blurred shots at the picture element level are the norm, sharpness and pixelation are rarely seen do to the low resolution and magnification of the CCD,which likes to run hot.  The camera only takes one jpeg mega byte in ideal light. It will produce a tiff nine mega byte that is of lesser quality (saturation artifacts).  Using this logica million dollars is actually nine million, right ?Without f/1.8 your better off with one of their disposables.  The Auto Focus firmware reduces all shutter speeds to still life in low light or anything less than bright daylight.  Running three strobes on a tripod and dragging a 12Volt battery with inverter to provide power seems a little excessive.","Date":"February 14, 2002"}

Out-of-focus when pictures is  taking indoor under normal environment with or without flash. This is due  to the new design of the auto-focusing function, which uses a diode (CD) to  detect distance and exposure, unlike the previous models that were using  Infrared. The CD technology is fine as many SLRs do use diodes to assist AF  and Exposure, however, there are faults in the current design that leads to  picture taken indoor completely out-of-focus.2. The software available  to be used in the computer for picture handling has a problem with the  Delete function, which does not work properly. It works in one instance and  fail in another.

If you leave the batteries in the camera, they are drained in a day.  I finally figured out that the best way to go about it was to keep a separate bag with the batteries in it and put them in the camera before I use it.  This is very annoying because then it wants you to re-set the time when you start it back up again.  Not good for close-ups or low light.  (I tried to use it to photograph my jewelry but got poor results.)  Also, it does not have a zooming lens.  For everyday shots of my family and friends outdoors or indoor with a flash, this is an OK camera.  Still, I have found that you can get a much better product at a comparable price in the 35mm format, which you can now get \"developed\" and put on disc at most major film development outlets.

Quality pictures, good autonomy on batteries, and ease of transfer of pictures to Mac or PC were strong points. Only gripes were slow start-up process, and a complex self-standby mode (after a few minutes without use) that makes it necessary to re-start completely (close hood, switch off, open hood, switch on). MAJOR problem: it is very fragile (don't know about competition on this, but obviously not perceived as an issue by reviewers or editors..?), and no protective case supplied. It got knocked in a padded bag, and this split open the front cover (holding on a few flimsy screws) and split a major internal circuit. $150 to replace the part, plus labor!

It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward.  The lens is protected by a sliding door.  This is kind of cool.  You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in \"capture\" mode.  When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches.  This is all great.  HOWEVER, to power off the camera and return to \"review\" mode, you slide the door part-way shut.  The problem is, if you're not extremely careful, the door jams into the extended lens, and the lens _skids_ back into the body against the door.  Once the lens is fully retracted, you can close the door completely.I gave it two stars because all the goodness of this camera will be lost when your lens motor burns out because the motorized lens was rubbing against the door.  *sigh*The Camera's great, but it's door/power switch design has much to be desired.","Date":"November 28, 2000"}

I was debating sending it in, but my brother-in-law and I played with the battery compartment a little and, by holding the door partly open (but all batteries in contact) it would work.  Looks like age and plastics and tenuous connections, since, having taking it apart and prodded gently at some of the connectors, it now sometimes works.  I suspect the flex of the plastic body is too much over time.  The method of turning on the camera is just too mechanical.Since the price of \"official\" repair is a large percentage the price of a new camera, I won't go that route.  But I will open it up again and look more closely with a loop to see if there are any obvious solder cracks or other loose connections.  Hey, it's long out of warrantee.  Anyone with more experience with this problem (all three of you) holler.  The very high cost of repair and lack of DIY information on the Olympus site are why I give my otherwise awesome little camera just two stars.","Date":"April 29, 2003"}

Terrible service.","Author":"Ken Boettger","ReviewID":"R22H7PAV1V5JAW","Overall":"bad","Content":"This Olympus digital camera has a warranty that says ANY impact makes the invalidates the warranty. That includes setting the camera down on a table or desktop. In essence, no warranty. Check the warranty before you buy ANY Olympus.I dropped mine 2 feet to a carpeted floor. It stopped working. They sent me a bill to fix the camera and said they would not honor the warranty because it was 'dropped'. Sure I dropped it, but I would think the product would be a bit more resilient than that. It takes very little to damage the insides of this camera. It took months to fix (and then there are ongoing problems and lots of arrogance on their phone support). This is not the camera to rely on for a vacation... or anything for that matter. Look at Fuji, Nikon... anything but Olympus. They left a bad beer taste in my mouth. .","Date":"November 5, 2001"}

On the Olympus web site they state that I will have to purchase an upgrade to XP. When I try to follow their link to obtain the upgrade I am taken to a web page detailing a flash gun, a remote control and a flash bracket, so I am still unable to download pictures.

{"Title":"Poor design, quirky operation, excellent pictures","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R11U46JWCTHXCZ","Overall":"bad","Content":"First the good news: the picture quality is excellent with this camera. Even on the middle grade mode, clarity, and color are pretty remarkable. Now the not so good news: the designers need to just plain go back to school. Here is the short list: 1. Quirky software: Camedia is poorly laid out, and does not work dependably each time. Sometimes you can download pictures, other times no go, the clock just runs forever. I've switched the software to different computers, restarted cam, restarted computers, no consistency. It ran once for half and hour with no download. Worse, the programmers weren't bright enough to put an escape function when this happens, which means you have force quit Camedia to try again. When the camera does mount on your desktop successfully, the file names are nonsensical. What is \"DCIM\" or \"IMOLYM\"? The programmers must have been in brain jail not to think of a more user friendly way to name the files on your camera. The controls for rotation, enlargement, etc. are crude but they do work, though poorly. One would think that the software engineers would adopt more user friendly conventions ala Adobe Acrobat or Photoshop, industry standard conventions at this point. 2. Shoddy construction: from top to bottom, nearly every moving part of this camera seems on the verge of breaking, when used normally. Many reviewers have mentioned the cover, so I won't repeat this comment. The battery compartment cover design is awful, you truly feel that you may damage it permanently, simply by closing it with batteries loaded. The outport cover, (this is where the output lines for connecting to a TV or PC are located) This is held on my a tiny flimsy looking rubbery hinge. Scary. However, good news: the flash mem card cover IS sturdy! 3. Ergonomics: again, the designers need to wake up and smell the coffee. Really! One control that you will find yourself using over and over is the monitor button (turns on and off the little LCD monitor in the back). This button is located in an area that is just awkward to access repeatedly. Try it, you can do it, but it's not a natural movement or location. Another button frequently used is the \"menu\" button. The designers locate this button right next to the monitor button. Same shape and almost same icon. The result, one has to be careful which button to press, they are so similar. Hey guys, how about a different shape, or color? Or a different icon. Geeez, come on! 4. The control functions on the monitor are complex, but fairly workable with practice. Still, there are many features and selections, and one wonders why it's not laid out to be more user friendly. Conclusion: I know this cam has gotten good reviews here, but I think that the reviewers are either much brighter then myself, or very easy to please. I tend to think the latter.","Date":"March 25, 2001"}

They couldn't supply a patch, so I spent another $25 buying the latest version of the software.

It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward.  The lens is protected by a sliding door.  This is kind of cool.  You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in \"capture\" mode.  When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches.  This is all great.  HOWEVER, to power off the camera and return to \"review\" mode, you slide the door part-way shut.  The problem is, if you're not extremely careful, the door jams into the extended lens, and the lens _skids_ back into the body against the door.  Once the lens is fully retracted, you can close the door completely.I gave it two stars because all the goodness of this camera will be useless when your lens motor burns out because the lens was rubbing against the door.The Camera's great, but it's door/power switch design has much to be desired.

Your computer, if you have any scanner or Palm software on it, will not recognize the camera and, therefore, you will not be able to download digital images to it.

Polaroid knows this problem exists (but isn't telling anyone unless they call their customer service department for help) and suggested I uninstall the scanning and Palm software and then reload the Polaroid software to solve the problem. Then I supposedly could relaod my scanner and Palm software and everything would be fine.  Two hours later...same problem.  With a dozen or so million Palms out there, and every one of them synced to a computer, and probably at least that many scanners in homes, and all of them tied to computers, it is hard for me to believe that Polaroid did not test their software against a computer configured with scanner or Palm software, if not both.

{"Title":"Some Details About the Polaroid I-Zone Digital Combo Camera","Author":"Robert A. Gilliam","ReviewID":"R294V1JVJ2KA32","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Polaroid i-Zone combo digital camera is a 640x480 digital camera with one meg non-expandable memory, fixed focus lens, automatic flash, and no preview screen on the camera jammed onto a mini-polaroid i-Zone camera. It's big and awkward, which is probably why it hasn't been successful. I can never figure out how to grab it without putting a finger into a lens. I only bought it because I got an extreme bargain on it at my grocery store of all places. Overall I'm happy with it and will use it for my web site and to send photos by E-mail, but it's no replacement for a 35mm camera and a scanner.It's a TWAIN device so you can acquire photos directly from the camera with any TWAIN-supporting software, such as Paint Shop Pro. Photos are compressed as JPEGs inside the camera. It holds \"up to\" 18 shots, but unless you're taking photos of blank walls, it'll be more like 16. It takes about 2 minutes and 20 seconds to transfer a full load of photos from the camera through your PC's serial port. You can download the photos selectively, but you can't selectively delete. You can only clear the entire camera memory at once. The JPEGs are copied directly from the camera to a folder, so you don't have to worry about appropriate recompression unless you want to make modifications. The compression is a little too extreme. If you brighten with gamma correction, you can really see the JPEG squares.The flash doesn't go off unless it needs to, so you can get non-flash-lit pictures by providing enough light. The exposure isn't very well controlled. Indoor pictures at less than 2 feet are totally washed out by the flash, but that's easy to fix. Either light the subject better so the flash doesn't go off, or partially cover the flash. I used several layers of masking tape. The lens is so small that you can take pictures really close, like a few inches, and they'll only be a little blurry, but the flash must be totally covered with aluminum foil.It uses 4 AAA batteries and doesn't have a plug for a DC adaptor. I'll probably install one myself.It uses a 9 pin serial port, so if you have a serial mouse, you'll need a second port. Most computers have a second port, but it might be a 25 pin rather than 9. If so, you'll need a converter which will be about (dollar amount).It does not have a tripod mount or a timer, so you'll need help if you want to take pictures of yourself.It comes with a mosaic application which converts images to mosaics of other images. You'd think it would be fun to play with, but it lacks a simple browse option to select your own photos to use in making the mosaic. They don't let you use your own images because they want to sell you their supplemental image CDs. Of course they don't tell you this up front. I got very aggravated struggling to make it use my photos.","Date":"November 10, 2001"}

Pagano","ReviewID":"R2AZRACM85DLGT","Overall":"bad","Content":"The camera works reasonably well for its price; however, the software it comes with for recognizing the camera when plugged into your computer via the serial port fails to work properly if your computer has scanner software installed.

After uninstalling the (HP) scanner software the Izone software did recognize the camera and downloaded the digital images as advertised.Polariod tech support suggested that reinstalling the HP scanner software after the IZone software was installed would solve the problem.  It did not.  Anyone with scanner software installed are likely to run into this problem which is not covered in the IZone trouble shooting guide.

I put off buying a digital camera for a long time. Too complicated, I thought. Too much to learn, it'll be a hassle to use with the computer. But our business required that we advance and go digital. When it came, I was apprehensive. But within minute's of reading through the basic operation's manual, I was snapping pic's around the house! Wow, I thought!  What took me so long?! It's very user-friendly, it feels and fits well into your hand, is light-weight & has a large view window. I like that it's a marriage of both HP and Pentax technologies. Both companies that I know and trust. It come's with an infra-red remote to snap shots, but I found this a little tricky to use as you have to get it pointed at the camera just right in order to triger a shot. The automatic timer works better. There was one clitch however. It was draining the batteries over night. I called HP and they somewhat hinted that, yes, that was a little problem with a few of them. But it was no problem at all to swap it for another new one with either Amazon, or HP. I'm glad we opted to try again and not choose another brand. The 2nd. one has a much longer battery life (week's), and we use it a lot. If this is to be your first digital camera, I'd recommend you also order an extra flash card, extra set of rechargable batteries and a re-charger, and a card-reader.  I like the \"SanDisk\" reader. It's simple and easy to use. So figure on spending at least another $100.00 on accessories. For a mid-range digital camera, in my opinion, this one can't be beat.","Date":"July 18, 2001"}

{"Title":"very poor battery life, very hard to to use","Author":"Peter Young","ReviewID":"RI83NZ0F0PF2Q","Overall":"bad","Content":"purchased at Fry's, it is bad news from that day onwards, battery life is non existent, you have to keep using the Li type very expensive 4 x AA battery.  It does not come with any ac adapter or charger.  For ac adapter you have to cought up [more money].  Otherwise, the power drains anytime whether you have the camera on or not.  I tried using recharable batteries and they run out real quick.  Fry's refuse to take it back.  Then the camera started acting funning and cannot program, i return it to HP, they send another one, same problem, call and they send another one.I am still not happy, the short battery life and that it uses 4 X AA Li battery means it is very expensive to operate.  The camera is somewhat bulky for what it has.  Also hard to program and use, the manual is confusing.  I would certainly never buy a camera from HP again.  By the way, it was Made in the Philippines, does this have anything to do?","Date":"May 26, 2002"}

The pictures I took looked like they were taken through a plastic bag. When I tried to enlarge them to 100% they got even worse, But I did notice that the smaller they were, they got better. But then they were too small to see what they actually were.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to email or print pictures from the Jamcam3.0 let alone use the special effects to frame them.

Apparently they've never used a REAL digital camera. Admittedly, the price is cheap. But so's the quality. The image quality is really bad, even for the low resolution. There's no zoom. There's no preview screen, and you can't delete bad shots. It eats through batteries like wildfire. The images aren't stored in a standard format, so you can only download them through the camera, not through a MMC reader. Now that wouldn't be so bad, but unfortunately, the JamCam software is quite unstable and crashes often during the download, which means that if you have more than about 40 images on one card, you'll never manage to get them out. Overall, I can only recommend you to stay away from this camera unless you really only need a toy for your kids.","Date":"May 21, 2001"}

It's a great teenager camera (which is obviously the entire point from just looking at the camera packaging itself and the name) because it's cheap and it does the job, but if you're looking for any pictures from your trip to France that you can look at 10 years from now and sigh over with your kids, this is not the camera.

After the first day, I tried to download the photos via the USB to my computer.  It did not work and subsequently erased my photos.  I then had to use the serial port which takes forever.  After a check to see if it works, I took about 70 pictures.  It took about an hour to download, but then would freeze my computer when I went to save them. So I had to redownload them over three times.  After I finally got them on my computer I realized that the camera did not take all of the photos that I took.  Infact it lost some of my most important ones.  It would appear as a blank white/empty photo.  The rest of the photos are very grainy or black even with the flash being used.  I was and am furious.  Before you go thinking that this is just someone who has no clue and created these problems himself, realize that I am an IT professional and very competent on my computer and systems.

I took the camera in to a local camera shop, and tried it side by side versus some of the other 3 megapixel cameras (Canon, Olympus).  The results were pretty shocking.  All cameras were set to their highest resolution and set to \"Auto,\" and the pictures were taken by camera professionals.  They were disappointed in what they were selling. The biggest disappointment I have is that the reviews I found on-line (dpreview.com, et al.) were very favorable towards this camera.

I tried higher quality modes (e.g. fine & high) with mediocre results.Overall I am not satisfied with the purchase and switch.  The nicest feature of the Coolpix over the S20 is that you can attach various lenses to customize shooting.

{"Title":"Buy the Kodak 4800 or the G1  instead of the 880","Author":"K. Thiele","ReviewID":"R15CKFCVQ1SSBO","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am amazed by the number of positives reviews for the 880 ... and can conclude 2 things:  either these folks have little prior experience w/ digital cameras, or my camera is broken.  And although my camera is sorely in need of a firmware update, I do believe it is operating as designed.The good points first ... in good lighting conditions, and when all of the camera's parameters are appropriately set ... this camera has the raw ability to take exceptional pictures.  The lens is quite good (for a digi-cam), and the resolution provided by the 3.4 M-pix CCD is fantastic.  However, such fantastic pictures are rarely obtained.The bad points ...  1) The camera is incapable of automatically setting its own parameters (focus, aperture, speed, etc.) on its own.  Its \"auto\" and \"Scene\" modes stink.  The worst is auto-focus.  Even in bright outdoor pictures, this camera almost always produces focus errors.  So far, I can always guess the distance to the subject and manually set the focus better then the camera can.  And believe me, setting the time on a VCR is a lot easier than setting the focus distance on a Nikon 880.2) Indoor pictures are awful.  With less light, the focus errors increase.  Even more importantly, the \"grain\" is awful (like using an ISO 1600 film).  The \"auto\" modes set the ISO to 400 (max), where grain is the worse.  When I override this (ISO=100), I can reduce the grain, but the dumb camera doesn't compensate for the change in film speed, so I end up with very dark pictures.  Finally, all of my indoor pictures have the white balance heavily skewed toward red/yellow.  The amount I have to \"push\" my pictures with the computer afterwards is tremendous.3) The User Interface ... this is a non-trivial device to master. I probably have invested over 20 hours of experimenting to try to master this camera.  One can just use the \"Auto\" modes, but then one is stuck w/ very mediocre to poor pictures (worse than my old 1-Mpix cameras).  And if one was to use their famous \"Scene\" mode, it takes almost 20 seconds before you are ready to take the picture (10 seconds to power up, 10 seconds to navigate/select the Scene menus). And the manual overrides are very difficult to master.  For example, to set the ISO, one holds down one of 4 buttons while moving the zoom in/out.4) Lots of other annoyances, which make this camera frustrating to use everytime I pick it up.  In a typical social situation (trying to capture the memories), perhaps only 20% of my pictures, w/ the Nikon 880, are keepers.  With my older Olympus D600 (1 M-pix), I would get 80% good pictures in similar situations.I bought the Nikon 880 through the internet, so I don't have the option of returning it.  Why did I buy it ...  I thought it was the best bang for the buck.  Note: when comparison shopping for price, always always add an additional $150 to the base price of the 880 to account for the charger, the rechargeable battery, and a larger flash card.  This camera will eat a $12 disposable CR5 battery in under an hour.  If I had to do it again, I would have bought the G1.  This assessment is based upon playing w/ a friends camera,  and based upon my personal bias toward performance.  My 2nd choice might have been the Kodak 4800 (no 1st hand experience, but my sense is that this is a fairly easy-to-use point-and-shoot that would produce good pictures using their auto modes).Hope this review helps.  Since I am stuck w/ the 880, I will be publishing my preferred settings for this camera on some of the news groups in the near future.","Date":"May 13, 2001"}

First of all, when I bought it, I needed to download the Windows ME driver (a fix not indicated anywhere in the literature) - then it worked fine.I used it regularly as an MP3 player at the gym.  Took it to Mexico with me on a vacation - it crashed.  Came home - it worked!  Go figure...One of the advantages of digital photography is being able to see you pictures immediately after you take them.  For this camera, you'd better have a computer close by as there is no viewer window.One day when I took the camera out to use it, I discovered the tiny plastic hinge on the battery compartment door had broken (this is not the type of damage that some unknown person could have done - it was in a protective bag, just sitting on a shelf).  I continued to use it holding the batteries in by hand when needed (ugh!).Now for the real disappointment - I purchased a new computer system using Windows XP, downloaded the driver from Pretec's site - no go.  Camera won't work.  Tried to contact tech support via the web - filled out their web form and - imagine this, when I hit \"send\" I got \"Page not found\" (after a couple of tries too).  So, refusing to give up, I called their headquarters.  The recording said they were open 9-5 Pacific time (oh well, it WAS only 8:54 Pacific - no point in getting there early I guess) and asked if I'd like to leave a message for tech support - I pushed the appropriate number and...GUESS WHAT?

Carver","ReviewID":"R3LH6X8H6UGBC0","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was looking forward to using this camera, based on the reviews here, but I've actually been really disappointed.  Kodak got the form-factors right -- it's easy (even fun!) to use and I liked the little sound effects.  But the image quality is dismal, even for VGA resolution.  We have an old VGA-resolution Kodak digital camera at work, and I was expecting at least that level of resolution.  Instead, the edges of the photos were smeared and blurry, and there was very little usable detail in any of the test photos I took.  True, the colors were bright and it handled exposure/light levels well.  But what use is that when the photos resemble a Monet painting?  I wanted an inexpensive camera that produced small photos that I could email to relatives (and avoid having to shrink down mega-pixel files).  The quality of the pictures in this camera, however, is just way too low to be usable.  It's going back to the store!  It's a shame -- it's such a fun little machine!  If it were ... cheaper, I might consider keeping.  PS:  It's not just this camera -- this is the second one I tried and they both had the same problem -- extreme distortion around the edges of the pictures.

I wanted to break-in to the whole digital thing and thought I'd start out with a faily cheap camera such as this one. I figured the cost was only equal to x-many disposables anyway. I knew beforehand that this only had 2MB internal memory and that the resultion wouldn't compare to my professional equipment. However, I wanted to give it a try and needed a little lightweight something (less than 5oz, compared with my 3lb Mamiya 645).I must admit I was very disappointed. The software which came with this camera was pretty good (for a freebie) but the camera itself is a little quirky. Obviously you can't review what you've got in memory unless you do the download; but I could live with that. However, one truly frustrating thing was the clearing of memory. I found this almost impossible: and if you can't clear the memory, it's full-up and you can't take any more shots. I ended-up having to take the batteries out and leaving it well alone for a week.Thereafter I re-loaded the thing and tried again. This time it seemed ok and managed to delete everything I wanted. The pictures were just ok (as I suspected, but you get what you pay for, right?). Then one day it just stopped working. I hadn't used it for a week or so and when I did it just stopped; and no, it wasn't the batteries.So beware guyz. Perhaps I was unlucky.

{"Title":"Inexpensive, but flash and design frustrate overall","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RHU6YEB3RX4N3","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera is relatively inexpensive, but it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Battery life, flash charging time, image processing time, and poor design all conspire to make this a frustrating item.Battery Life:  The only time this camera works as it should (i.e., flash charges in a reasonable time, LCD can be used, etc.) is when used with superior (read \"expensive\") batteries.  There are no rechargeable power options, and when sending photos to your PC, do not attempt to use any power cord but the one HP sells (for a hefty price) or else you run the very real risk of frying the camera.Design/Ergonomics:  The camera's design is very poorly executed.  It is difficult to hold the camera steadily without placing your fingers over the lens; consequently one is forced to hold the camera in an awkward way.  The viewfinder is not well aligned, and has no depth (i.e., your view out the viewfinder can change a good deal as you slide your eye from one side to the other).  Finally, the trigger button has a poor feeling--it's requires that you press down too long.Flash Charging:  As noted above, with anything but the best batteries, the flash will take a ridiculous amount of time to charge up:  upto 25 or 30 seconds.  I've missed many a photographic opportunities waiting for the flash to warm up.  Furthermore the camera's default setting upon powering on is with the flash enabled, and changing that setting takes several seconds too.Images:  This camera does produce good images in most light (although it tends to overplay reds in low light, and underplay reds outdoors).  However the time required to process an image between one snapshot and the next is sometimes somewhat slow.Price:  Price is the only real strong point for this unit.  In retrospect I would have opted up for something more, especially considering that the price of digital cameras seems to be dropping $50 or so every six months.","Date":"October 23, 2001"}

First, it eats up batteries faster then anything I've seen.  So I decided to buy rechargeable batteries for it - only to find out after taking a closer look at the manual that THIS CAMERA DOES NOT SUPPORT RECHARABLES.  It gives no real explanation as to why and HP keeps suggesting that you buy energizer e2s (the kind that shipped with the camera.)  Im a little suspicious that this may be a marketing scheme on energizers behalf. Second, It only comes with a 4mb flash card which isnt enough (it will only store 5 high quality photos)  When I bought a 32mb card for it, THE CAMERA WENT DEAD and I had to get a replacement.  HP stated to me on their forum that the camera seems to randomly do this when upgrading the card. Finally, the software that comes with the camera is so idiot-proof that it is absolutly worthless.  It has almost no editing functions and can't even resize the photo for printing. The camera design is just really bad overall.

{"Title":"A bug in the software will break the camera","Author":"Amy G. Rogers \"lomga\"","ReviewID":"R1R1WOAGRP3BJN","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera has two very bad problems.  First, it goes through batteries like they're going out of style. Several other reviews have advised using rechargeable batteries, but in fact, that's a very bad option with this model. The user manual doesn't explain why, but on page 47 it says \"do not use rechargeable batteries.\" I researched this a little - rechargeable batteries get too hot, putting the camera's innards at risk of melting.  More importantly, any use of rechargeable batteries will void the service warranty. A voided service warranty would be bad under any circumstances, but it's especially bad in this case, because this particular camera is more likely to break than many others; there is a bug in its  software.There are two ways to delete pictures from the CF card. You can use the camera itself, or you can use your PC when you have the camera connected. The bug comes into play if you use your PC to delete pictures - you run the risk of \"toasting\" the camera's firmware. \"Toasting\" sounds bad, doesn't it? It is indeed very bad - the cost of repairing a \"toasted\" camera is much greater than the original price of the camera. (Meaning greater than the price of the camera when it was sold new two years ago.)  Cameras under the service warranty are simply replaced, but if the service warranty has expired or is void, the customer must pay.This is a well-known defect; in fact, it is one of the most-discussed problems involving the HP 215 on HP's \"Support Forums.\" The original post dates back to September 19, 2001.I was fortunate; my camera was still under warranty when it broke.  I had an extremely difficult time with HP customer service, but eventually I did convince them to send a replacement.The replacement camera is adequate, but that's about it.  The on/off switch is poorly designed.  It takes a delicate touch to properly turn the camera off, and I've lost count of the number of times I've accidentally left it on and returned to find the batteries dead.The focus & shoot function is aggravating - to \"focus\" you must gently depress the button half way, and then you must wait for a signal before you can actually take the picture.Judging the camera functioning as it was designed, I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars.  With the software bug and HP's lousy customer service added in, it really doesn't deserve any stars at all!","Date":"March 9, 2004"}

{"Title":"Terrible!","Author":"C. Boudreau","ReviewID":"R1L8LDMU00SCT2","Overall":"bad","Content":"The battery life makes this camera nearly useless. Most times we wanted to use the camera, we needed to switch out batteries first. It would be cheaper to get a better camera and save the money on electricity or batteries. There is also a long delay from the time you push the button until the time the picture is taken, so you can forget about catching kids at the right moment. To make it even more difficult, what you see in the view finder is not neccessarily what is in the picture. Many heads have been cut off in pictures from this camera. I just bought a Kodak digital camera to replace this, and it is fantastic; none of these problems. I don't have anything good to say about this camera. I got it when it first came out a few years ago, so it wasn't even cheap at the time.","Date":"November 28, 2004"}

You need to invest in a new flash card... the 4MB one is nothing. The camera is a little fussy but once you get used to it you will be fine...If you want a camera to have fun with this is a good choice.I give the device such a low review becuase I had issues with it with Windows XP and HP was of no help what-so-ever. The person I talked to at tech support asked 5 questions prased differantly about when I bought the camera (if it was in warenty perriod). After answering correctly on the first 4 questions I said it was in 2000 instead of 2001 and I was immediatly transfered to someone who was going to take my information to bill me (it was early in the morning and I made a mistake!). I told the guy that is was withing the past year. I told him it was last summer. That is the most recent summer ago. I explained thoughly and then he asked \"So what you are saying is that you bought it in the Summer of 2000\" and stupid me I agreed! I just wanted to get my camera working and be done with all the blasted questions! So I had to dig up my recipt (luckily I bought it on Amazon).

I must, however, update the information and recommend that consumers avoid the HP 215.My camera died after only six months of operation, and from innate design/production flaws.  That was when I found out that HP does everything it can to discourage customers from reaching a customer service representative or getting HP to honor their warranty -- it was one of the more horrific experiences I've had with a vendor.I won't bore you with the long details but it took many hours of my time sitting on a 900 number (my dime -- they have no toll free numers) just to get HP to admit the camera was broken.  After a long battle, they allowed me to send in my broken camera for replacement.  They sent me someone else's used and broken camera.  This cycle repeated four times, with HP continuously sending me broken cameras in the mail and waiting for me to give up.  It took an email to the CEO to finally get a working product.  That's just not right.For several years, I was employed to purchase, maintain, and repair all computer equipment for my department.  HP used to make wonderful, durable products and used to have great technical support (especially the documentation).  Things have changed, however, so caveat emptor!Since I purchased this camera, many more great, cheap digital cameras have come out on the market.

The first problems I had was it would not save any pictures I took.

Highest on my disappointment list would be the software package and lack of good documentation. Second would be the consturction of a camera specifically for AA sized cell usage without providing for the use of rechargeables which 95% of the consumer base would wish to use.Suspected is that this will be a throw-a-way. I'll use it till it breaks and then throw it away. That may be sooner than later. The last \"unusual\" glitch were photos taken taking up space on the memory card yet not showing images upon viewback. Another nice software conflict was the requirement to delete images on the memory card after uploading so the next batch on the card could be uploaded (large memory card).[Update 5-6/02] This has worked out better than orginally expected but not enough to change the rating. By removing batteries between longer periods of inactivity battey life is extended and the performance is acceptable.  Biggest complaint now is that the screen has always been too dim to use outdoors.  But combined with the Photosmart 100 and printing right off the memory cards, the output is surpriningly solid for the price.The software/camera interface issues and battery problem which should be a product strength, combine to suggest one read a lot more prior to securing any digital camera product.

The picture quality is as good as can be expected on 1.3 mega pixels.  The ease of use is marginal (it usually takes a minute to explain how to use it to someone else).  But the problem I incurred was HP's customer support.  It was abysmal.  It clearly labeled support for Windows XP on the box, yet when connected to an XP machine, it didn't recognize the device.  It warns you that it has not been XP approved.  After seeing this, I figured I could just get on HP's website and download some new drivers...wrong.  They wanted [money] US to ship a CD out with the new drivers (no option to just download them, by the way).  I could be mistaken, but I see something severely wrong with that.  After visiting a few forums about such a subject, I heard that people who did buy the CD had to have it in their computer anytime they wanted to upload pictures to it.  Eventually, I just installed the drivers despite the warning.  There haven't been any noticeable side effects except that it's usually a bit slower and it crashes occasionally.

About 10 months after I purchased the camera (and had the original replaced, remember) the LCD screen became very blurry so that I could not even see the picture that I'd just taken.

This was my first digital camera and I was really disappointed in what I saw in the pictures.  They were grainy and lacked detail.  I suppose if I looked more closely at the camera, I would have noticed the 1/8 inch diameter lens and that might have clued me in that there would be a difference.  I was just looking for something to take pictures to send in e-mails and this did not do the job.  The pictures taken inside were dark.  I expect that if I only used this camera outside on sunny days it might work better.  I also found it very hard to hold.  Because all the controls are on the side that you hold the camera, the camera seemed unbalanced and was easily dropped.  The wrist strap is a must.  ... is the most that I have ever paid for a camera, and I guess I expected more.  I can see from the general pricing of the digital cameras that this is on the low end.  Since I was not after something that would be used for printing pictures, I had assumed, from all the favorable reviews, that this camera would work.  I was mistaken.  I am not sure I place much trust in  reviews, without some actual photos to back them up.  The software to import the pictures into the computer worked very well and was fast through the USB port.

Not having an optical zoom feature like other cameras, it is very difficult to zoom in on your subjects unless you walk up to them and stand just a couple of feet from them.In addition, under low light situations, the LED viewer is not able to show the images you are trying to take photos of.  You are restricted to using the view finder to find what you are trying to take a photo of.  I found out about this limited feature while attending a wedding reception.  I was not able to see what I was trying to take a photo of unless I used the view finder and as a result, many of my photos show the bride and groom very far off in the actual photo.The camera takes wonderful photos outdoors and in limited flash photo situations so it is a great camera for those types of photos.

I thought that Hewlett Packard would probably deliver a decent level of quality, but not necessarily the best. As I was planning on using it mainly to sell stuff on online auctions, I didn't need a camera with lots of features or spectacular quality.The controls on this camera are very easy. I suppose if one wanted to they could get away with just pressing various buttons until they got to the menu item they wanted. You can simply link the camera up to a USB port and not bother with installing software.The quality of picture, however, was rather fuzzy. I sell collectibles online, and the camera did not capture enough detail to show if the item I was selling was damaged or not. I stood from a few feet to 12 feet away, no difference. I finally gave up and sold it to someone else who didn't mind the quality issues. I think this camera does particularly poor at short distances. My work had a different brand camera, same megapixels. It did a much better job, and I currently awaiting my new Olympus.If quality is a rather low concern and the price you're getting is very low, this camera might be worth it. If there's not that much price difference between this camera and another with better quality (say a Nikon Coolpix 2500), I'd opt for the other camera.","Date":"August 4, 2002"}

I refused to pay $25 to speak to someone who will tell me that yes, my camera is broken and it will cost more than the camera to fix it.The camera worked decently well until the flash broke. The delay in pressing the button and taking a picture was ridiculously long. Otherwise I was satisfied for 13 months.","Date":"July 30, 2002"}

{"Title":"TRY Before Buying","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RE7Q6CAT48O49","Overall":"bad","Content":"After researching Consumer Reports and everything else I could find, I picked the C-2040.  Before purchasing one for yourself - get your hands on one and experiment.My job demands documentation of models etc, so I decided to replace my 20-year-old SLR and go digital.  Features such as zoom, manual focus and accuracy of the viewfinder (for composition) were important to me.  To start off, the 2040's zoom feature is operated by a small lever that zooms very quickly without the precision of a traditional macro lens.  The manual focus feature was the most disappointing - you must guess the approximate distance between the camera and the object you wish to photograph from a complex menu.  I had an economy Kodak camera in the 1960's that utilized that same guessing concept.  The viewfinder was too small to be usefull, especially for close up shots.  The LCD screen is also very small, and the picture/color is below par.  Plus, the manual advises against using the LCD screen much because it consumes battery power.  Overall, the controls and the images are too small (I am 20 yrs old with perfect vision).To transfer your pictures from the camera to a computer, an AC adapter is required, but be aware that it is NOT included with the camera.I returned the camera to the store and am sticking to my old film camera for now.","Date":"December 31, 2001"}

{"Title":"Smart Media is a poor choice","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RS5RXH4M4KHYE","Overall":"bad","Content":"an \"ok\" camera with a good lens but crummy memory type. It needs used Compact Flash memory cards. Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE. It can hold 4-5 raw images. Also in a camera costing this much, rechargable batteries and a charger should be standard (and for most other cameras it is).","Date":"November 8, 2001"}
{"Title":"Resolution 3040 Super","Author":"Roland B Houser","ReviewID":"RQFKG3TZ48Y0S","Overall":"bad","Content":"Other consummer reviews I agree with wholeheartedly!  Negatives, I feel, not mentioned:  1.  Camera does not have a \"hand strap\".  I used the one from my Kodak 260.  2.  Lens cap, altho coming now with a \"stap\" to attach to lens, still must be released manually - would prefer it to release once camera is turned on or at least fall off being held be strap once lens pops open.  3.  Windows ME \"sees\" the Kodak DC 260 if it is attached via the USB cable and immediately brings up thumbnail images for review and download to selected folders with, in my case, Photoshop acting as the default editor.  You have to select the \"disk\" under My Computer, then do 2 clicks of mouse to get to the camera images.  Or, as one reviewer stated, you can use an inexpensive Smart Reader, pop the disk out of the camera and insert into the reader for fairly fast downloads.  Here again, extra steps that I feel should not be necessary with the 3040.  4.  A cover would be nice for the view monitor.  Taking the camera out of a pouch can, if not careful, cause finger prints to appear on the view finder as you grip the extruding retracted lens with its cover and a reach over digital where the thumb or fingers finds the view monitor.But resolution?  This digital with its f1.8 lens can't be beat.  Outstanding!!!","Date":"March 25, 2001"}

Now obviously it's not the choice.The camera used for web only should not cost that much money even though it has 10x optical zoom (the expensive factor) I would rate it 5 stars now if its price was lower than $100.Ask yourself these questions:- Why do you buy it when you can buy another camera w/ higher resolutions at the same or lower price (e.g Finepix 2600, 2650,2800...) so you can print really good 4x6 pictures & sometimes 8x10?  Of course you can use your picture for web pages...- Who need the outdated floppy disk now?  I guess the floppy drive won't be available computers in the future. It just makes the camera so bulky. Of course its low capacity can be used only for low resolution pictures.  If you can spend that much money for a camera, I guess $40-50 for memory is not that expensive.Last month my brother bought this camera & I bought Finepix 2800 at the same price.  He is so disappointed w/ his when seeing what I can do w/ mine.  He is now using his old 1.3MP camera rather than use this MVC-FD75.

The 3.5\" floppy makes for speed and convenience. BUT... the negatives outweigh the positives with this camera. It is heavy and bulky (Mostly because of the floppy disk application). The pictures are coarse and grainy and not suitable for printing with ANY printer. It is necessary to focus this camera throught the LCD on the back and in bright sunlight, you can't see what you're trying to photograph. I also have an HP618 digital and there is no comparison, yet they sell for the same price. I am a believer in SONY products and own several, but they dropped the ball with this one. I'm sure that their higher end models are much more satisfactory, but I would not recommend this camera to anyone.

The thing that really got me though was that you have to turn the camera off to view the pictures you just took.  So everytime you want to see a picture you have to turn the camera off and, turn on the LCD.  And then if the picture wasn't good you have to turn the camera back on, turn the LCD back on, and then reset your preferences, it's really annoying.

Got it for about a hundred greens. Thought I had a landed an awesome deal, until the camera proved you get what you pay for. CONS:1. Battery eater: No rechargeable battery is good enough for it to last through 20pics. I couldn't leave batteries in it for a week - they would be run down in that time.2. Major issues with focus: The whole user interface with communicating when its ready to shoot is incredibly unreliable. I would switch it on, and wait for the green and amber lights to stabilize. They would sometimes, and not others. Even worse, they would and wouldn't on the same shot, with the same composition. Very frustrating.3. Unreliable save: I was never sure if it saved a pic. Sometimes I would press the button - but nothing. No indication on the camera what's wrong. Then I would have to close the cover, reopen it to switch it back on, and pray it will shoot this time - 50% chance. No indication of what's wrong. Using the LCD at the back is a pain too. Often it wouldn't have enough power left to let you browse through to see if it took pics alright.I could go on and on, but the sum total: very frustrating, unreliable camera, best take your money elsewhere. I don't care about bells and whistles, but one expects if its called a camera, it will take pictures. If its called a camera 100% of the time, it will take pics a 100% of the time!!As for mine,after missing some critical pics on a very important family occasion, and some more of household items while documenting before a relocation, I finally hit it against my tiled floor, broke it in a hundred pieces, drilled through it in various places, and am sending it to Olympus's HQ with a letter explaining what they should have done themselves that I had to PAY them to do!","Date":"August 24, 2003"}

Except for the 20 or so that got wiped out by a CF card error when the batteries went down. I would highly recommend to anyone buying this camera - get yourself a USB CF card reader and dump the images frequently to your PC. And try to avoid reviewing shots you have taken in the camera. Dump the files to your PC and then you can look at them all you like. I would also avoid deleting shots while shooting, as this will put you at a high risk of card error due to losing battery power while reading the CF card. Get a large capacity CF cards and edit the shots when you get home. Another annoying thing about the camera is that when the batteries expire (as they do constantly), the zoom lens is frozen in position. Without battery power, the lens doesn't retract into the camera. The integral lens cap also remains open. This has to have been an engineering oversight. Why couldn't the camera just close the lens and THEN shut down? Duh.Summary:Good camera, Frustrating power and CF card error issues.Don't believe the hype.
