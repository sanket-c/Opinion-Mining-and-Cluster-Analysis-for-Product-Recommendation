{"Title":"So Pleased","Author":"K. Brick","ReviewID":"R1YXAVRXIJTYTE","Overall":"good","Content":"After shopping around locally for the best deal on an LCD, we found this deal on Amazon which beat them all on price.  I was a bit hesitant to make such a large purchase online but could not be happier with how it all turned out.  The tv arrived within 9 days (including a weekend), Eagle Global contacted me within five business days to schedule delivery.  They gave me a four hour window and when I called them the morning of the delivery, gave me a specific delivery time to within 10 minutes.  They get five stars as well.  The tv is beautiful, stylish, and has great picture quality even though I don't have HD yet.  The Mustang mount works great, directions are straight forward so if you can hang shelves, you can install this mount yourself.  I'm EXTREMELY happy that I saved at least $600 by going through Amazon (no shipping costs, no sales tax, and a couple hundred dollars retail on the tv and mount) and the process went so smoothly.  I highly recommend this model television through Amazon and Eagle delivery.","Date":"January 14, 2007"}

The picture and sound are great on this TV.  I was really worried about the standard def picture on here since I don't have an HD Tivo, but I was pleasantly surprised at the picture.I got the Samsung upconverting DVD player at the same time, and it's a winning combination.  The picture from most DVD's is superb, there are a couple that are not from major studios, that did not look as crisp but I'm sure that is because of the source.Samsung is really doing an excellent job, they are going to be the next Sony.","Date":"January 13, 2007"}

The provider actually was Etronics. Had a delay in the shipping and received 4 or 5 days after planned, but it was no big deal to me. Very easy to unpack and install. Set up is easy as well. The quality of the picture is awesome for an LCD. I've been researching over the internet about flat panel TVs for some time before buying this one. I was planning to buy a Sony Bravia, but woudn't like to pay much more just for the brand. I went to this Best Buy store and they were side by side. I played for a while with both remotes and the quality of the image was pretty much the same for me. At that moment I decided to buy this TV. I'm very happy with my purchase, but......as already mentioned for some reviewers there is an issue with the sound. Some buzzing when reproducing low frequencies. I intend to buy a home theater, so I won't have this problem anymore. Anyway, to enjoy the full experience you must have a good sound system.","Date":"January 11, 2007"}

We also live in the middle of nowhere (western ND), so you wonder how technology can reach us out here on the frontier.  Saved a few bucks anyways and the shipping was free.  I crossed my fingers and made the purchase, everything has gone smooth with the TV so far.  If you can get a HD signal, its absolutely amazing what the picture is like.  Can't wait for the rest of the local channels and satellite companies to change over.  Only gripe is that the delivery actually showed up like 6 days ahead of schedule (according to internet tracking) and the delilvery guy spoiled the suprise since I wasn't home to take care of it.  He didn't really care either, but thats the kind of service we are used to around here.  Anywho, thanks for the great product, I would recommend it.","Date":"January 18, 2007"}

Just try and stop a shipment from them once it's out the door. Several Email back and forth did not bring me any help. \"How\", I asked, did I get from the \"shopping Basket\" to the Checkout\"? Well, they said. \"we put you on the \"one click\" checkout as you are a regular customer. Ya right, I had bought a book a week earlier. The real kicker in the pants was when they used my CHECK CARD, which I used to buy the book, instead of my CREDIT CARD, which they have on file. This put me into an overdrsaft conditioned and trashed my savings account to cover it. No, they would not credit my CHECK CARD and put the charge on my CHARGE card.

I thought that would make things a lot easier but there are so many choices. I started with a Westinginghouse 40\" with a built-in dvd player. I didn't think it was too bad so I tried it out for about 25 days through my retailer's 30 day return policy. As I got down to the final days, I began doing some more research and found that the Samsung's were rated fairly high for performance. Wow, what a difference! With the Westinghouse I figured that I was going to have to settle for a so-so analog off-air picture on any lcd but boy, was I wrong. The Samsung LN-S4041D is a fantastic set and I would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind paying a little more for a whole lot more!

After pricing it at many retail stores and online retailers Amazon beat everyone by $500, no tax and free 3-5 day shipping. I received the TV 3 days after I ordered. The TV is light and took about 15 minutes to set-up. The only thing I am not crazy about is the base does not swivel. I plan on wall mounting so it's not an issue, but the base does feel cheap. Sound is great even without a surround system.I have Time Warner HD service as well as an air HD aentenna from Radio Shack. I can not believe the image and coor quality of this set for under 2k. It is simply amazing. Unfortunately it has ruined any non-hd broadcast. The difference between HD and non-HD is unbearable.

{"Title":"Great TV!","Author":"Chriscle \"chrisgbgsu\"","ReviewID":"R2CK6YJV9DFKEL","Overall":"good","Content":"After about 6 weeks of researching LCD TVs I decided on this model and I am very satisfied with it. I started out looking at 32\" inchers but realized that 40\" is significantly bigger for a marginal price increase. I also knew I wanted to go Samsung all the way because the are supposedly the best but I'd just like to mention most of the Westinghouses I saw looked just as good for significantly less money. So, yes, I bought the name. After all the time I spent looking into these it really came down to a few Samsungs the LNS4096D, LNS4095D, LNS4051D, and the one I bought.There were 2 reasons that I ruled out the 3 that I ended up choosing against. Money wasn't one but I'll point out here that the 96D is about $800 more while the 95D is about $650 and the 51D around $200. All of these TVs have speakers on the bottom and the 95 & 96 have little panels that serve to reflect the sound out to the viewer. In my experience with adjusting the volume at pretty much every TV in best buy these TVs just didn't have the sound quality that this one has. Sound wasn't a very high priority of mine going in but once I heard what I did it did become a concern. I also like the look of the speakers on the front it makes the TV look bigger.The biggest and ultimately overwhelming aspect that turned me off on the ones that I didn't pick is their gloss finish. I know that might sound bizarre but read the amazon reviews of these other TVs and you'll see the owners even mention that as the a negative (one even saying he would return the tv if shipping wouldn't be such a hassle). I had ultimately wanted the 96D because of the 1080p capability but having seen it in person I couldn't get over the gloss finish. It really makes these TV's look like [...].I have mostly spoke about why I didn't take the others making it sound like I just settled on the wonderful LNS4041D by default but this isn't the case at all. 90% of the reason I wanted an HDTV is to play my xbox 360 in HD so visual performance is a top priority. This TV delivers. The picture looks incredible. It is every bit as good as the other TVs that I spend hours comparing in the stores. It has a 3000:1 contrast ratio (which means the difference in contrast between the brightest white and the darkest black for those of you who don't know). 3000:1 is very good it is surpassed by some of the other newer samsungs but TRUE 3000:1 is among the higher end of the market. The TVs that make outrageous claims like 10,000:1 are using slanted data based on certain modes that aren't practical for the everyday user. 2 HDMI inputs is a very definite convenience that we will appreciate more down the road as the cable companies and other devices use this as their main connection port. I don't have HD broadcasting from my cable company as of yet and this thing broadcasts the regular signal incredibly. Also this TV has a presence to it. When I round the corner from my kitchen to my living room it flies out at me - this thing commands attention. I wanna show it off to my friends. Let me also point out by ordering it on amazon I got it at about $380 cheaper than best buy. I used my amazon credit card for x3 the points which I will probably use toward a surround sound system. All with free shipping.Lastly, let me comment on the shipping. I chose not to join amazon prime and get 2 day $3.99 shipping because I don't like to join things that I'm just going to have to cancel in a month. I got free super saver shipping that told me it would arrive in 5-9 business days. After the order completed I got an email that told me I could expect it between Nov.30 - Dec. 8th. 14 to 24 days after I ordered it! I was pretty upset. However, I got an email sometime during the next day saying that it had been shipped. There was a link to Eagle's website (the shipping company that amazon uses whom I'd never heard of before them). The link showed me just where the package was and it also had the expectation date of December 8th. The TV arrived in my area just 4 days after I had placed the order and was delivered 6 days after my order! It would have been a day sooner had I returned their first call in time. The delivery guys brought it up the stairs to my apartment and set it where it needed to go and I was good to go. I would also like to mention when deciding on what type of shipping to get you should check if there is an amazon distribution center near you before you order. I noticed after the fact that there was one just one state over in PA and that may be why I got my TV so soon and at times you'll notice people who've said with the super saver shipping their products didn't come for weeks.","Date":"November 27, 2006"}

I did a lot of research, as usual, since this is a big purchase.  It was either this TV or Sony Bravia.  At the end of the day, Samsung and Sony use the same LCD pannels.  They have a joint venture called S-LCD (for Samnsung's expertise in LCD and Sony's know-how on TV's) which supplies all LCD pannels used by Sony and Samsung.  I figured this is a good thing for both companies and TV's from both should be in a compatible quality.  I furthered my research based on this and looked at all specs, functions, and prices.  I paid a little less than $2,000 for Samsung TV and it was a great purchase.  I would have been happy with a Sony TV, but Samsung seems to be up and coming thesedays (and recent deterioration of Sony products), even beyond Sony, at least in my opinion.  Anyway, my parents love this TV and my brother mastered how to manipulate all the functions.  Clear picture, no lag time, fast responding, good angle, very light, easy to install and use, etc.  I stop by at my parents' time to time, and I love this TV.  I am planning to buy a TV soon, but price is falling sharply, so I might wait a little bit.  But I will buy another Samsung LCD.","Date":"November 27, 2006"}
{"Title":"You will be happy with this product.","Author":"Eugene Yee","ReviewID":"R4GGZ119KXDZG","Overall":"good","Content":"Okay, so you're trying to find a TV and you can't debate between plasma or LCD HDTV.  You're mixed up & broken between screen resolutions and screen sizes.  You're worried about details involving burn-in, contrast-ratios, and which brand is the best.I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.Face it, you're basically going to have to do the research by yourself, or simply take advice from people you really trust.***** ***** ***** ***** *****Here are the reasons why I bought this TV:It's LCD HDTV.  Plasma may have better contrast ratios, and may provide smoother picture but I am a gamer.  I play games that involve overhead displays (health bars, ammo meters, etc...) that are essentially frozen on the screen.  Buying a plasma would only provide agonizing burn-in with those regions.It's Samsung.  Samsung produces really amazing LCD HDTV's.  If it were a plasma, I'd definitely opt for a Panasonic.It's 40\".  I originally wanted a 42\" TV, but then realized that I'd be spending several more hundreds of dollars for 2 more inches.  Reality check---I recently graduated from college and I am broke.  40\" is still very big (and quite a luxury) for a college graduate.The resolution---it maxes out at 1080i, I know.  Higher numbers are wonderful and all, but usually end up yielding higher PRICES (at least $[...] more).  If you really think about it, there isn't much that outputs 1080p, besides the PS3.  If you didn't know already, the PS3 is $[...], and is probably the cheapest BluRay Disc player on the market.Besides the PS3, your current DVDs & gaming-consoles & HD Cable Television will not improve, since they are currently maxed out at 480p - 1080i.  To me, 1080p is not big enough of a technological jump for me to shell out another $[...].The price.  Of course you have been shopping around.  You know that this TV's price is pretty darn cheap.  Unless you're gonna find yourself a magical mail-in-rebate, or some type of employee discount, this is gonna be THE DEAL for you.  Think about it---Amazon's free shipping.  No tax (depending on where you live, i guess).  This is the price that you pay!!!The one *one* complaint I have regarding this TV is that there is only one Component input (RGB).  As a result, I plug in my Nintendo Wii via Composite (yellow-cable for video) and my XBox 360 into my Component.This basically forces me to purchase an HDMI cable for my XBox 360, so that I can up my Wii to Component cables.All-in-All, this is really a great deal.  Amazon is a very reliable source, and the TV is outstanding.","Date":"March 19, 2007"}
{"Title":"Pros vs Cons: Samsung LNS4041D 40\" Wide LCD HDTV","Author":"Jason R. Michaud \"JD\"","ReviewID":"RJI7FMDVBPGI1","Overall":"good","Content":"Pros:If you are looking for a high quality, reliable 720p LCD with gorgeous gaming potential and dramatic HD - this is the unit for you! I'm sure by now you know the differences between LCD and Plasma. More than likely you want a sharp HDTV with great viability (about 170+ degrees), and much easier to hang on a wall weighing in at about 40 lbs (half the weight of a comparable Plasma). The ATSC tuner drives the picture and compensates for low dull pictures and removes haziness. Screen preforms well with fast gaming in HD with Xbox 360. If you are going to be using the speakers they sound great and even simulate surround sound.Cons:The remote must be within about 20 degrees of center. So if you actually use the remote or use your cable/satellite remote to control the volume, you won't be able to do it from everywhere in a big room unless you are almost directly in front of the screen.Image refresh on dark scenes and fast motion sports is not as good as plasma. Black scenes will have a 1 or 2 second memory until refreshed with a new scene. Closeups of turf or grass and fast motion on the playing field leave a bit to be desired vs. plasma.Conclusion:If you need an all around flat panel 720p (not 1080) HDTV with brilliant color and good sound without the worry of burn-in from a plasma then this is a great choice.","Date":"January 3, 2007"}

I heard too many horror stories about how the shipping was a hassle with delivery time windows.  Most worrisome, though, were the bad stories about the warranty on the tvs.  You're basically putting your tv's life in the hands of the mfg's.  I didn't want that so i bought mine from BestBuy and got their warranty which works great since I live right down the road and a 4 yr contract was only a few hundred dollars.  So, the tv itself rocks!  It's not the latest model (at the time I wrote this) but it much more elegant looking than the shiny plastic new model right now.  Picture's great, cost is amazing (mine with 2 HDMI cables, warranty, high powered surge protector AND upconverting DVD player was only $2500 from BestBuy).  So, regardless of where you get this tv, it's definitely a great buy.  Kudos Samsung!","Date":"October 11, 2006"}

{"Title":"Move over DLP and Plasma, LCD is here to stay.","Author":"Dan E.","ReviewID":"R18S2XIKEKWBGF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been drowned with so much information about which hdtv to get.  I finally decided what fit the bill as the most ideal, perfect tv for me.  At first I thought the dlp.  It was so much cheaper than lcd or plasma's in the same size, so why not?  Well I don't like dlp because the rainbow effect and if you ask me the blacks were good but not great.  There's also an annoying lag when playing games with these tv's.  Do yourself a favor and don't consider dlp's for gaming.  LCD is the way to go.  Plasmas have too much of a burn-in risk.  Would you wanna break a 2,000 dollar toy because you want to play games on it?  So obviously lcd was the ideal tv I was looking for.  The picture on it is perfect right out of the box.  For watching DVD's I use movie mode.  For OTA or DTV I use either dynamic or standard settings, which both look fantastic.  Oh and let me just say that the quality of the over the air hdtv channels is amazing.  HD channels show as clear as the sky and they are totally free!! What a deal!  And if you don't know already in 2009 everyone will be broadcasting 100% digital, HDtv for all you folks who are still deciding whether they should make the move or not.  I made the move and I couldn't be happier.  This TV performs like it should and it's always fun watching your favorite music videos or xbox 360 games in amazing hd glory!!!  Take care and good luck in your hd journey.","Date":"October 1, 2006"}
{"Title":"Sleek 40\" LCD with Great Picture","Author":"JAX","ReviewID":"RUL4TBNJ0EU9B","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall, I am very pleased with the Samsung LNS4041D 40\" Wide LCD HDTV.  I use it with regular cable, HD cable set-top box, DVD, and VCR inputs.  From the set-top box, I am running both S-video and component cables.  I have yet to try an HDMI cable.  I get a good picture with regular cable or VCR inputs, a better picture with with DVD or S-Video, and the best picture with component cables.  I briefly experimented with an amplified antenna before going to HD service from Comcast, but I could only receive 2 HD channels and they were both from PBS.  (HD from Comcast only costs me an extra $6.50 a month which allows me to receive ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, and PBS in high definition.  I discovered this option after some searching of the Comcast web site when I balked at having to pay $50 a month for the digital-channel package in order to receive any HD channels.)By big complaint is that I cannot use closed captioning when receiving the best HD signals via component cable or HDMI.  This is why I had to add the compromise S-video input.  So if I need to understand the dialog, I watch HD using the S-vido signal and settle for a better picture.  If I am watching golf or football, I use the component signal to get the best picture.  Let me hasten to add that this captioning limitation is not specific to Samsung. From what I have been able to find on the web, this limitation happens because of how HDTVs process component or HDMI inputs.  I am bringing up this issue because I was caught by surprise.  So, if you regularly use closed-captioning, be prepared to compromise, and don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you have set up or connected wrong when you can't closed captioning.I have been using this TV for about six months with no problems so far.  We really like the sleek black, space-saving design of this LCD HDTV.This TV has a lot of features which tends to make it complex to set up if you want to go beyond factory presets.  For me, I am willing to spend the time and effort to make adjustments to picture settings that produce a more pleasing picture to my eye.  Also, I am using this TV with a surround-sound system which adds to the comlexity on the one hand and negates some of the options such as automatic volume control on the other.The bottom line is that I am very satisfied with this HDTV, and would recommend it or similar models.","Date":"January 9, 2007"}

From my perspective the sony had a slightly better picture, but at $1,800 not THAT much better.  Plus the samsung has a 2nd hdmi input and PIP.  As several other reviews have indicated, take the time to explore the picture settings....out of the box the contrast and saturation are so high that tones don't appear life like.  The energy saving feature allows you to step down the brightness of the fluorescent tube, and for really life like blacks go with medium during the night and maybe just step it up to low in the daytime if you've got a really bright sunlit room.I did have one stuck pixel on my screen but i haven't bothered to return it as it absolutely isn't noticeable from viewing distance and it may get \"un-stuck\" over time (it isn't dead).One reviewer commented that the left speaker vibrated on occasion and this was very irritating.  I had the exact same issue, but resolved it completely by going into my set top box (motorola from comcast) and turning the compression from heavy to standard.My first flat screen purchase (although i do have a DLP projector) and overall i think good value.  And although I'm very picky about this sort of stuff, for the life of me i couldn't see the difference between 1080 and the lower HD resolution of this set.  It's worth the extra bucks for a larger display but at 40\" i think you're just throwing your money away.","Date":"February 13, 2007"}

i got it.  the speakers on the side add to the width of the unit.  it arrived via eagle logistics service, i called them a few days ahead with some questions and they answered all of them.  one thing i asked is if they would make a delivery appointment, they did and they somehow already had my phone number.  however, you have to remember that this company has a somewhat limited delivery schedule (at least in my area).  some days they would be out in a different city and had no openings for delivery to my area.  they ended up delivery on a thursday with a window from 10am to 2pm, good thing i had someone there to accept delivery or i would have had to wait for several more days and they don't work on saturday.  it arrived within 6 days of ordering, which is well ahead of what amazon predicted.  the tv arrived in a large box with black muck on the bottom.  the workers also arrived with black muck on their shoes, they didn't unpack it either.  good thing is that the tv arrived in perfect condition.at first the picture looked horrible with standard analog cable.  artifacts were everywhere and was very grainy. however I ran my video essentials dvd (over components) to adjust the color, sharpness, contrast and brightness.  this made a huge difference.i have a series 2 tivo, it's best output is s-video.  it doesn't look that great when i play back recordings in basic, it looks like VHS, but that was expected.  if you have a series 1 or 2 tivo, you should record in at least medium and set the tv to display in 4:3, it looks much better than 16:9dvds look really good over component, only after i ran my video essentials dvd.  at first i had a problem that i would get an all blue or all red picture, the problem was that i needed to switch the output on the dvd player (phillips dvp642) to progressive over components.  i'm not sure if it's worth the money to buy an upscaling dvd player, i thing your money is better saved for a blu-ray/HD-dvd player.i have a nintendo wii hooked up to it also with composite cables.  it looks decent enough over composite, that i will not upgrade to component cables.  also, i only have one component input and don't want to buy a component switcheri also have my pc hooked up through the vga input, it's terrific.  make sure your video card can display this tv's native resolution, otherwise you will need to display at a lesser resolution and it will not be as crisp.keep in mind that the inputs on the back are more towards the left side of the unit (when viewed from the front).  my cords barely reached because my A/V rack was off to right of the unit.  instead of buying all new longer cords, i just moved my rack to the left side of the tv.not sure why it has dvi audio input, it doesn't have a dvi video inputthe tv throws off a good deal of heat, however you can hit a button on the remote to change to energy saving mode.  it has 3 modes, this is great for nighttime viewing because it dims the display a little.pros:great price (free shipping + no tax!)amazing picture, OTA HD looks amazing.  dvds aren't bad either2 hdmi inputsgreat viewing angle, one of the best i've seenbuttons are hidden on the side

due to HDCP (copy protection)av2 input (s-video/composite) is on the side of the tv and looks ugly when you plug in cords because they stick out, but is nice for a quick connection.limited picture

into the menu to change it(even a cheap rca tv allows you to move the PIP arounnd the screen easily)PIP has some limits, some sources only allow certain PIP sources to be displayedno QAM tuner, so you

Kowalczyk","ReviewID":"R1UYRRNKZRKJ37","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV about two months ago and have been extremely pleased. The picture is absolutely terrific and being a semi-ludite (ie: cheap) I have neither cable nor satellite. I had a new HD capable antenna mounted last fall when my house was re-roofed and I live in a major market, less than 10 miles from the transmission towers. So, just from the HD broadcast signal I have an incredible picture with this set's integrated ATSC tuner. In fact I gained 6 to 8 new stations that I never had before because of the multiple signals a station can broadcast by use of the digital spectrum. I had checked CNET, PriceScan, Price Grabber and a couple of other sites for revues by both pros and purchasers and taken a trip to Best Buy to view the picture before I settled on this Samsung model. There was only one seller I found in my research with a price better than Amazon, but that seller had a lousy BBB rating and scary customer reviews. So I felt the extra $40 for Amazon was well worth it since I've done very satisfactory business with Amazon in the past. I still saved well over $400 (not counting taxes) from what I would have paid at a big box outlet. If I have any complaint it's that the remote has a very narrow path, you have to be pointing the remote pretty close to dead on to the set's sensor when you use it. This is my first new (non-kitchen) set in 20 years and I couldn't be more pleased.","Date":"April 17, 2007"}

Katzbeck \"Weezy\"","ReviewID":"RSYW8UMUAWHW6","Overall":"good","Content":"I had no intention on buying a TV when I went with my friend to Best Buy. I started to check out the tv's to pass some time and came across the Samsung LNS4041D and really was blown away by the quality and price. I started asking the saleperson about the TV and began to get a complete education on LCD VS Plama and HD, HDMI connections along with digital vs analog (which I had at the time). I went home and told my parents what a great deal it was, we both had heard that Samsung was one of the leaders in LCD's so we went back to Best Buy the next day and discovered they were discontinued and an additional 10% off.  We bought two right then and there for $1120. I have been very pleased. I had to get use to the 16.9 ratio on the analog channels because they have a very stretched look that seems distorted (especially if you are use to a tube tv) however, the HD channels and movies that are broadcasted in widescreen HD is such a joy to watch it makes it worth while to have purchased the TV.Both my parents and I have experienced a popping and cracking noise thru the speakers. My parents returned theirs and got a different Samsung but I went on line and researched others with this problem. I found thru different reviews on Amazon's site that there are people experiencing the same problem with many new LCD/Plasma's (not just Samsung). A few recommended a power conditioner because apparently there could be a slight power issue thru the electrical outlet.  The power conditioner sends a clean smooth current to the tv w/out interruption. A bit advanced for me but the laymen way I explained it was the only was I understood. I went to Best Buy and purchased a \"Monster Power Strip\" for $80.00. It was a bit pricey but after I realized what it did (essentially removes \"dirty\" power and is also a surge protector that warrants up to $150,000 of connected equipment) I didnt think so.  So if any one out there experiences this problem try the power conditioner before going thru all the return nonsense.","Date":"April 7, 2007"}

Took it 9 days to get from Cincinnati, OH to Memphis, TN (About a 9 hour drive) I tracked it from the time it left their warehouse and it actually made it to Memphis on a Thursday night.. They were suppose to call to set up an appointment finally on Monday afternoon I called them and they were suppose to deliver between 9am - Noon on Tuesday well after sitting around they called around 2pm to say they would delivery between 4 and 5pm.. Needless to say the guy showed up around 7:30pm basically leaving me a prisoner in my own home while I sit and wait and wait. Oh well the TV is great specially at this price.. Saved almost $400 over what I would have paid at Best Buy or Circuit City so it was well worth it..","Date":"March 13, 2007"}
{"Title":"Surprisingly good","Author":"Surrounded","ReviewID":"R2GG3UCSUTYDGN","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this at Sears after comparing it to all of the others on display.  This was our first LCD, after owning CRT and projection TVs.  The Samsung easily outperformed the other available brands in the store.  Viewed next to the higher-contrast model, the difference is obvious, but at home it is by itself and the contrast on this model is adequate.  The best feature is the sound; this is the only equipment I own where I can listen to CDs (through a DVD player) without an audible background hiss.  Be mindful that if it is mounted on an inside wall, the sound will be clearly audible in the adjoining room.","Date":"March 7, 2007"}

{"Title":"Excellent picture and inexpensive","Author":"Mark Bookworth \"MB\"","ReviewID":"RVU7TE88D99XP","Overall":"good","Content":"We are happy with this purchase.  The colour rendition is excellent via component cables.  I have not yet tried the HDMI connection but once my Oppo 981 arrives I will.  There are controls on the right edge allowing you to adjust volume and change channels if you don't have the remote in hand.  There is also a convenient set of standard RCA inputs (Yellow White Red) at the left edge which we use for the kids' V-Smile.The only complaint I have is the lack of an additional component input however, once we switch to HDMI, all should be well.Like any HDTV, the quality of the input is key which is why we've opted for an up-converting Oppo DVD player.  The V-Smile does not look that great in 16:9 mode but is fine in 4:3.","Date":"January 30, 2007"}

I discovered this Samsung to be the best bang for the buck.  I couldn't beat the Amazon price (free shipping and no sales tax).  It was at least $300 cheaper than the same TV at Best Buy or CC.  Once I ordered the TV it arrived via Eagle Shipping within about 1.5 weeks.  I opened the box and discovered it had been dropped and one of the corners of the TV was chipped. I called both Amazon and Eagle and they immediately shipped a replacement (free of charge).  I had to wait another week and a half but it arrived in excellent condition.The TV itselft is great.  I don't have HD programming yet and won't for another 6 months or so. Regular programming is good and I can't imagine how good HD will eventually look.  Easy to set up, very light.  The sound is about average for any other TV I've ever had.  DVD look outstanding.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this TV.  You can't beat what you get for the price.","Date":"January 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great TV for the Money","Author":"John Kochisarli","ReviewID":"R2B9KX64ELNOGO","Overall":"good","Content":"I just this week took delivery of this wonderful LCD TV. Ordered it on 3/21, shipped out on 3/23, received it on 3/28. Pretty quick for FREE truck freight shipping! The carrier, Eagle, also did a wonderful job with the delivery, making certain the box and everything inside was in perfect condition before the driver left. That alone says a LOT about the company.Now on to the TV, this 40\" is larger in terms of over-all height and width than most other 40\" LCD's, but it's a good thing. Really makes a bold statement once you get up on to a wall. The image quality with my 5 year old standard Pioneer DVD player (RCA connections) was not to great, so I upgraded to a Samsung up-converting DVD player model 860 with an HDMI cable and was super pleased with the image results. I didn't think it would actually make a difference, as most of the reviews I read it wouldn't, but take my word for it - it did! The thirty or so HD channels that come through my dish are also very clean and crisp. I really don't have another LCD or Plasma to compare it to, but the colors and contrast seem to be on the ball. Standard channels come in OK, seem to be a little more pixilated, but then again I guess that's expected and not really a drawback of the TV. Sound is good and volume level is decent. It definitely doesn't WOW you. A little more power would have helped. I recommend some sort of surround sound home theater setup for true movie theater like experience. Menu functions and controls are as easy as you're gonna get. Took me a whole 5min to set everything up and figure what's what. The remote control is pretty basic, nothing fancy. One problem with it though, if you don't point it DIRECTLY at the bottom corner sensor on the TV (even with fresh new batteries) it sometimes doesn't register. I upgraded to universal remote, and that's proven to be much better in terms of range and control than the OEM unit.All in all I'm quite happy with this TV. None of the local electronic giants could even come close to amazon'a price with FREE shipping and NO tax! Even at it's cheapest, so called \"discounted price\", amazons price was still around $300 (+ tax) cheaper than if I had purchased it locally.If you're on the fence and don't know if this TV is worth the price its being offered at, don't wait much longer. I can't see this TV lasting any longer at this price, so pick it up before they're all gone!Shop around, do your homework, but do it fast! At this price, this one's a no brainer! Thanks Amazon!","Date":"March 30, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great Price - Good HDTV","Author":"A. Carter","ReviewID":"R3H22NC31J2IRI","Overall":"good","Content":"I've read a lot of reviews before purchasing this unit and it was a tremendous help to me.  So hopefully this review will be helpful to someone.  First I want to say, I am very happy with this Samsung 40\" LCD.  The pros, 2 HDMI inputs, 3000:1 contrast ratio, (DNIe) Video Enhancer, digital noise reduction and 1080i resolution.  Some cons, standard def. looks pretty good but the 16:9 wide sometimes looks a bit stretched when watching standard def.  Another con is the viewing angle; the picture becomes washed-out even at slight angles.  The sound on this unit is okay once the SRS TruSurround sound is activated, but I still plan on getting a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound System.  The brought this unit through Amazon via FREE Super Saver shipping.  The unit arrived in 5 days (great Eagle shipping service). I have to say, when viewing HD programs the 720p/1080i resolution looks great! The bottom line, if you are looking for a solid LCD for a great price.  I think you will be happy with this unit, I definitely am.","Date":"March 30, 2007"}

{"Title":"You will not find a better deal","Author":"M. Smearcheck","ReviewID":"RUWEI2ZQWWVAO","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture is amazing and the price is even more amazing. The difference between the standard channels and HD channels is night and day. Too bad Time Warner only has 7 HD channels in my area. I was a little worried about the shipping, because I live 45 minutes from a major city with an Eagle office, but I got the TV in 5 days. They called me the day before and gave me a 2 hour delivery window. They even helped set up it. I'm not sure what you would do if your TV arrives with a problem, because the delivery person told me that even if it was broken, they couldn't take it back and I would have to contact Amazon.The only feature that I dislike is the number of component video inputs. My XBox 360, Wii, and cable box all use component, but the TV only comes with one component input. So unless you want to be reaching around the TV every time you want to switch devices, you will need a but a component switch (I found one for $20 at Walmart).","Date":"March 12, 2007"}

{"Title":"Manufacturing issues","Author":"Bernie Margolis","ReviewID":"RI5ZDJU2EX3XR","Overall":"bad","Content":"I own this model of television and have been pretty happy with it for about four years.  Unfortunately about a month ago turning the set on became problematic.  It makes a clicking sound for a few minutes before giving up.  Sometimes it eventually turns on after several attempts.  I researched this issue via the internet and discovered that my problem is typical.  Apparently the capacitors that Samsung used on their boards were not rated to an appropriate voltage so they burn out.  I spoke to a Samsung service representative and they deny that there is an issue with this model, even though a simple Google search says otherwise.  They offered to send a technician to my house but said that I would be responsible for the cost of the repair.  I've decided to replace the faulty capacitors myself, just like many others who have had this issue (search for \"samsung lcd tv repair capacitor\" on youtube for examples).  I will not be purchasing any more Samsung products, however.  A $1400 television set (the price when I bought it) should last longer.","Date":"July 29, 2011"}

At that time it was advertised as 1080i resolution and 15,000/1 dynamic contrast. This is what I got. However, I now read where the item is listed as 768 resolution and 3000/1 contrast. Something tells me samsung reserves the right to alter specs on an item after it is released. Needless to say, the TV I received is magnificant regarding video (5-star). The audio would be rated 4-star as I get a vibration if I turn it louder than 1/2 way up. I don't care because I have a 5.1 surround sound system hooked up to it. I hope everyone got the same spec tv I got (1080i-15000/1) but I'm afraid they didn't. If I rated MY tv anything lower than 5-star, I'd be lying. It's a great tv. (LNS4041D)","Date":"March 18, 2008"}

{"Title":"Lot of TV for little money","Author":"Barbara Craig-Nichols \"clueless noob\"","ReviewID":"R1303NSDU0AGPA","Overall":"good","Content":"We researched and dithered and hemmed and hawed and finally made the commitment and bought the TV and it's wonderful. Since our old TV died because I virtually never turned it off, I have had to force myself to create new viewing habits, such as setting the timer if I'm feeling just the least bit sleepy.  Evidently there is a danger of 'burn in' when you are watching something that is not being broadcast in HD, (which means that the picture doesn't extend to both sides of the screen), so if you are watching a regular show (read not HD) and you fall asleep, you might find yourself waking up hours later with the TV on and those black bars on either side of the screen becoming a more permanent fixture.The TV was virtually plug and play - although you can adjust color, etc, we haven't had to, even on the bright blue menu of Direct TV.  Though it can be hung on the wall, we don't have ours set up that way, but we are still enjoying the convenience of the side video inputs.The only 'negative' part of the entire searching, shopping, enjoying HD experience was the week long variance between when Amazon said we would probably receive delivery and when we actually did receive it.  It took a little over 2 weeks to go from ordering it to getting it and it was ironic that I bought our new HD dvd player on the day that Amazon had initially  said that we would receive the TV and the dvd player still came 2 days before the TV did.The sound that comes from the built in speakers is quite adequate, and we didn't even bother with synchronizing our home theater system with the new satellite box and TV for the first 2 weeks that we had the TV - and it was only because I did miss hearing things from the home theater speakers behind the couch that it even became an issue.All in all, a great buy and probably the most TV you can get for that kind of money.","Date":"May 19, 2007"}

Only knock on the product would be the remote control. Didn't make sense to me to have the numbers at the top of the long sleek remote, but have the enter button at the bottom. Unless you have big hands, then it  shouldn't be a problem for you.I don't have HD cable programming as of yet, but the picture is decent still. DVD's weren't that good using regular RCA cables, but once I switched to a Monster Cable video component cable (my current dvd player doesn't have hdmi outputs), the difference was like night and day. I can only imagine how great the picture will be once I purchase a player with HDMI output. I thought the picture quality was fantastic, but after reading some reviews on this site, I'm going to adjust the video settings and see if I can't an even better picture.In closing, I'd recommend this product to any potential buyer.

{"Title":"Great for entry level: a technical review","Author":"Matt A. Kurkowski \"Electronic Addict\"","ReviewID":"R2R3JP06VIGE3","Overall":"good","Content":"This review is intended to be a little technical, so if you want an easy description of this TV, this would be it: it's a great TV with features most entry level LCD buyers are looking for: great contrast, decent response time, good color reproduction and an extensive jack panel including a FANTASTIC VGA PC connection.Here's the technical break-down of what I think makes this TV great:1.) It's an PVA (Patterned Vertical Alignment) LCD panel.  PVAs and S-PVAs (not usually available in this size) are my favorite over the other two common LCD panels: TFT (Thin Film Transitors) and IPS (In-Plane Switching).  TFTs (used most commonly by Sharp) boast excellent response/lag time (usually around 6ms); however, they suffer from the worst color reproduction and artifacting problems.  IPS panels (most commonly used by Panasonic) can be thought of as the older predecessor to PVA panels.  While they boast excellent color reproduction and moderate contrast, they generally have the longest response/lag times (usually in the range of 12ms).  PVA panels (used by Samsung and Sony) offer the best of both worlds with excellent color reproduction (keep in mind, color reproduction also depends on the set's lamp), the best in contrast, decent response times (usually around 8ms) and excellent viewing angles (up to 178* on S-PVA panels).2.)  It's made by Samsung.  Samsung and Sharp have long been the leaders in LCD panel technology, investing large amounts of money into LCD R&D.;  Samsung can take a lot of the credit for the dip in prices of larger LCD screens with the construction of their generation seven LCD plant (the generation number of a plant refers to the size of the glass panels they are able to cut to use in TVs).  Samsung built the plant and Sony rents/shares part of it.  SAMSUNG DOES NOT MANUFACTURE SONY'S LCDs.  This is a common misconception.  Samsung owns the plant in which Sony does its glass cutting, but the panels are independently manufactured by each company.3.) The PC connection is great.  Many LCDs come with a VGA connector to attach a PC and use the TV as a monitor (recently, Sharp has been removing this feature from a lot of its TVs).  What makes this PC connection great is that it will accept a full screen signal from a compatible video card, up to 1330 by 768 if my memory serves me correct.  Many LCD TVs will only accept a 640 x 480 or 600 x 800 PC input.4.) The matte black bezel.  You might think this is purely a cosmetic perk, but it has serious implications!  The whole reason that TV cabinets were originally black after the console era was because black draws the eye out, to make the screen appear larger and more vibrant.  The 51 series that Samsung offers does boast higher qualitative statistics such as a wider color gamut and higher contrast ratio; however, I still like the 41 series better because the high gloss finish on the bezel of the 51 series is extremely distracting.  Sharp started this trend last model year by offering glamourous \"piano black\" on their TVs, but think of this: a piano is beautiful because it has a high-gloss, COMPLETELY FLAT finish.  The high-gloss finish on these TVs accentuates all the bumps and fluctuations in the plastic of the TV.  It merely looks like high gloss plastic (that is far from completely smooth) instead of the glamoursly intended piano finish.  LCDs are great for brightly lit areas because they absorb, not reflect, light like plasma TVs do.  This high gloss finish makes a bigger difference than you might think.5.) The remote is ergonomically comfortable.  Anyone who has a Sony TV will tell you they're remote is confortable and easy to operate and anyone that owns anything JVC will tell you there are more words on the remote than in the manual.  Samsung has developed a remote control layout this year that the company has used across the board on almost all their TVs.  It's a perfect balance of functionality and ergonomics.  And it looks great too...6.) It's light.  And it's lighter than most LCDs in this size, especially over Panasonic.  Sony had issues with weight last year which that have since mildly addressed, but just compare the weight of this item to that of Panasonic's models as well as the depth.  The Samsung is slim and light, making it easy to mount on the wall without fear of it pulling the wall in.And in closing, I wanted to address a previous review posted here: YOU DO NOT NEED AN AV SWITCH TO OPERATE THIS TV.  Your connection set depends completely on what you are hooking the TV up to.  In the case of Time Warner Cable, they use a box to descramble some channels, so a box is necessary.  In most markets, a box is necessary from your cable or satellite provider to provide HDTV (this TV is an integrated HDTV, meaning it will receive high def broadcasts over the air if they are available in your market, but just like an old antenna, you have to be able to receive those signals; things, such as buildings, will interfere).  Usually you will hook your box up to the TV via component cables or a single HDMI cable, depending on your cable or satellite provider.  Hooking any TV up to standard cable with an RF cable IS ONLY GOING TO GIVE YOU STANDARD TV, unless your cable company provides un-encrypted digital cable.  This is EXTREMELY rare because a box allows the cable company to encrypt pay stations.  Unencrypted digital cable systems are usually only available in mass-purchase markets, such as on college campuses.  Be sure you understand your connect scheme and HD availability before you purchase a TV or explain your setup to a store salesperson.  Any QUALIFIED salesperson should be able to tell you what is right for you.(BTW, I often get people asking me if I work for any specific company--I do not work for an electronics company; I'm still in college.  I sell electronics at my summer/part-time job, but I sell lots of different brands and items, not just Samsung or any other brand.)","Date":"July 31, 2006"}

As always if you want the best picture use the best connection, in this case the HDMI.  Our cable box works flawlessly with this tv using an DVI to HDMI connector, which sends a pure digital singnal to the TV.The picture is great.  The colors are vibrant and have excellent contrast. This display is bright! Because our bedroom is dark and the tv is relatively close to our viewing area it almost hurt our eyes, we turned on the energy save to low level which decreases brightness and the display is still brighter then others I've seen. That means this TV should function well in well lit rooms as well.If I had any compliants is that the sound quality and output level is not very high.  In our case this isn't a problem because we have it hooked up to a mini-hove theatre system.","Date":"June 24, 2006"}

{"Title":"Great TV for the price","Author":"Bing Ng","ReviewID":"R1X1MJ2JA5JRNU","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this baby a little over a month ago and it has yet to fail my any of my expectations. For just ~$800, I got a decent sized HDTV that just brings woas to my friends when they see it in my room. Its picture quality is great and when I hook it up to my laptop, it is exceptional. I use it occasionally as a monitor and it is crystal clear. (I just might never get off my bed.) When I watch DVDS on this TV, it is amazing and feels as if things could not get any clearer. I can't wait till the day every channel is HD. :DThe sound quality on the set isnt as bad as everyone said it was. It is very decent but I am thinking of adding a surround system just for my own personal preference. The TV itself is very sleek and very enjoyable to watch. It is very light and I can pick it up and move it around by myself.One con I have about the system is the remote control. The buttons are located in the weirdest spots and it takes getting used to. It is really annoying to press the enter button all the way towards the bottom middle of the remote. And where the enter button usually is, there is a jump button that takes u back to the previous channel you were on.There is also a couple seconds lag to turn on the TV and that bothers me a lot.But for the price of the Tv, I am very glad I got it and am a proud owner of this set.","Date":"November 21, 2006"}
{"Title":"Good value LCD HDTV at the expense of controls.","Author":"Manx","ReviewID":"R339Q35TDCKKY9","Overall":"good","Content":"The picture quality on this unit is pretty good. Nice and bright with good contrast it looks just as good if not better than any other LCD in it's class. The unit itself is very stylish in mono-black and a gray bottom and the included stand is nicely modern. The TV also includes a cover for the hole into which the stand plugs into, which I find odd since now I have to carry around this extra piece in case one day I want to wall mount it. It should have come with the wall mounting kit.Peak power usage is 110 watts and it has \"power saving modes\" that should save energy but the picture will be less bright. That's ok, I usually end up running it on high energy savings since it easily overpowers my light.The dual HDMI inputs are great. I have a lot of consoles and A/V equipment usually all into the same TV and while I'm going to have to keep my composite and component switch boxes, it's nice to know that for now I'll be ok in the HDMI department. Loss of a dedicated DVI connector (one that wouldn't need an HDMI adapter) is slightly disappointing, though.Others say the audio is average at best but I find it good for my usage. You *could* get an LCD panel that fits in the same volume with a bigger screen but it would have speakers hidden along the bottom and I can't imagine those being any better. At least with the setup out of the box with speakers on the side I get good spacial surround sound. It's nice having a 5.1 sound setup, but I find in everyday usage I just don't want to be bothered turning on another device.Bad points? The remote control is horrible. I programmed a few additional devices into it and I find myself having to point pretty exactly in order to get them to work with it. I guess the IR LED on it is pretty weak. To make matters worse, the IR sensor on the TV is located in the lower right of the panel instead of a central location like the lower middle or something. Basic channel and volume and power functionality I already programmed into another remote and it works much better. The TV supports a lot of features that are useful, like putting the picture into Film Mode and Game Mode, but they don't have buttons and you HAVE to go into a menu to use them. That plus the poor communication of the remote to the TV makes it frustrating navigating menus when you're not sure if your button push is going to \"count\" or not. Other less useful things ARE on the remote. There are buttons I simply have never and are unlikely to ever push.Remote glut isn't new to Samsung devices, but the older ones I've seen at least had good IR blasters and receptors.The PIP feature is pretty misleading, in my opinion. You will not be able to simply cycle through all your inputs in a little window. There's a chart in the manual with sources that are \"compatible\" to be displayed simultaneously. I find it very poor and would rather they had left it out if it was going to be so bad.For MSRP this TV would be sub-par, but Amazon's got it for a price where it's a good deal in my book. I'd buy it again.","Date":"December 30, 2006"}
{"Title":"Excellent picture but no digital tuning","Author":"PS","ReviewID":"R20Z8L0SXMFV9E","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Samsung after comparing it with the Sony and Panasonic equivalent models. I found that the Samsung had the best picture as well as stylistically looking the best. When I hooked it up, it gave a very good picture for SDTV. However, I found one big flaw that may not affect most people. My cable provider does not scramble local HDTV broadcasts, thus if you don't have a HDTV receiver, you can access these channels. On my Panasonic 32\" plasma, I'm able to view these HDTV channels. These channels are access through my cable provider by using the dash (or dot) button. For instance, my NBC HDTV channel would be 92-3. My plasma is able to access these channels because it has a digital signal tuner. The Samsung has only an analog signal tuner. I could only access HDTV channels on the \"Air\" (antenna) mode and not in the \"Cable\" mode. Using an antenna on the plasma, I could pick up all of my local channels. However, on the Samsung I could only pick up 1/2 of the local signals. Granted, the antenna is small, but again, the plasma could filter the signal where as the Samsung could not (the TVs are only 1 wall apart). I returned the Samsung because of this fact and am going to get a Sony that has a digital signal tuner. I could be wrong and this Samsung can access digital channels, but after about 1 hour, I couldn't figure it out. Also, the instructions that came with the Samsung are lacking in description of the more technical side of the TV settings.All in all, if you've got a cable box to get your HDTV setting or getting your HDTV with a strong antenna, this LCD delivers a really crisp vibrant picture. However, it just didn't work for me.","Date":"December 31, 2006"}

{"Title":"Nice tv","Author":"Charles Montgomery","ReviewID":"R3CVVLSWMMESF3","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm not a TV or game nut.  I use Phillips rabbit ears and watch what I need from local stations.  I had to buy a new tv cause the old CRT one quit.  I got the 2641d partly based on an Amazon reviewer's good luck on an air antenna.I wanted a light tv cause I live on the gulf coast(evacuating). That said, I started looking for an LCD, built in dual NTSC/ATSC tuners, PC monitor capable.  The 2641d has them all and is light weight.When I set it up, I just plugged it in and clicked on all the local channels I knew of.  Some were OK and some snowy/bad. This made me buy another bigger(more expensive) antenna--It worked no better than Walmart's Phillips so I returned it.I figured I'd have to live with what I had, but one night I was playing with the auto set up and let it go through the channels and wow!Don't know what I did?, but now I get two or three signals from each channel, analog, HD, 480, weather and such.  ex: ch 5 is CBS analog; move up to 5-1 and same program but HD, 5-2 is weather, and 5-3 is 480/720.On my PBS channel I get 4 different programs. 42,42-1,42-2,42-3. One is HD others are clear as can be too.  Forgive me if most of you already know about this, but I told you I'm not a TV watcher and this feature blew me out.  The 3000:1 contrast ratio is one of highest too.Lesson is: read the manual and let the tv select the programs through the auto mode.  Best thing is that either the digital station is great or it won't pick it up.  I live nearly 40 miles from the broadcast antennas.This TV works great on air antenna signals.  Price was reasonable and picture is amazing.  Can't imagine seeing it on satellite or cable.  Now I'm playing with the favorites, PIP(PC+tv--not multi tv channels), and other stuff. Highly reccomend it.","Date":"April 7, 2007"}

It's great and I wouldn't want to buy any other. I've thought about even getting another one of these tv's (same series by Samsung) for the bedroom.I like that the console (outer shell) is a basic black rather than a glossy black as this does not distract from the picture, but rather adds to it and even makes it look bigger than it really is.With the excellent sound, picture, and adjusting capabilities, I have to note and inform future buyers of this product as a vertical black line (all the way from top to bottom), has appeared on my screen on the right side where the FULL SCREEN black bars would begin. When watching regular television, I like to put the mode in full screen rather than wide since I don't like the stretched out look. However, a line has recently appeared and the it's only on the right side (not the left).

I also thought at the time like televisions of the past, it may last more then 3 years. Or that it could be fixed if it broke. After the second year the power board acted up. The tv blinked on and off instructions said it over heated. It resolved itself a few months later, but the warranty ended 6 months prior. Keep in mind I have the best Monster Surge protector. It had the features and benefits before broadcast went digital. I was waiting for broadcast tech to catch up to my LCD TV. 2008 TV goes digital, I got 18 months of HDMI television and the power board burned out. Dead. I took it to Stanton Repairs, self proclaimed the honest guys who fix TVs. 2 weeks later these guys are stumped. It can not be fixed. I am shocked. A TV has such a short life span? I am a fan of Samsung but they don't stand behind their product. The disclaimer I got from customer service said in 2006, the technology was so new we gave you 90 days plus one year parts and labor. After 3 years of normal home use, Samsung had no idea what would fail. Stanton had my TV for 2 weeks with no phone calls or no news.

{"Title":"Overall decent flat panel HDTV","Author":"H. S. Jacob","ReviewID":"R10Y36U76QI4AY","Overall":"good","Content":"HDTV Tuner: The built-in HDTV tuner is very nice and works well w/ my antenna.  Switching from cable TV to the UHF (HDTV) signal is as simple as pressing a button.Image Quality: HDTV pictures are bright and rich in color. Contrast is very good too but not enough range in the adjustment level.  I do, however; feel that there needs to be additional adjustment for the \"gamma\" levels to bring more details out in the dark areas.  The Tonight Show does not suffer from this but most TV shows do.  It's somewhat annoying and I haven't found the right adjustment yet.DVDs and an XBOX connected to the component video both looked quite good (aside from the issue w/ the black levels mainly for the DVD and TV viewing).Sound Quality:  Adequate at best.  It's lacking in depth and detail.Remote Control: Typical Samsung.  I don't use most of the buttons and the ones I use (the standard volume, change channel, mute, previous channel) are easily found on it.  It's not stellar but I'm fine with it.VGA Input: The colors appear to be off w/ the standard VGA input but are fine elsewhere.  The image is stretched as well.  I'm not sure if I can get drivers for my computer to run in the native resolution of the TV but I would only use it infrequently so it's not crucial for me.  I don't have HDMI so I can't comment on that.Summary: If the picture's gamma could be adjusted and the sound was better, I'd give this 5/5 but hey, it didn't work out that way.  I'm still a fan of Samsung flat panels so I'm sticking with it.","Date":"November 15, 2006"}

I am pretty impressed with the samsung.

Not a problem for most programming, but distracting when it does happen.I like this tv so far (three months). It has a bunch of bells and whistles and settings that i have not yet investigated (it has a \"game setting\" that i don't even know what it is), but the hd and dvd picture quality is good - i generally watch a Sony XBR CRT, and it's not THAT good, but its pretty good. The price-performance ratio of the samsung made it an attractive option, with which i am satisfied.","Date":"November 2, 2006"}
{"Title":"Does not handle SVIDEO inputs well.","Author":"lynnejohn","ReviewID":"R1RYRQCD9N5YWM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this tv so that I could upgrade to HD, but I also needed to play my recorded shows from my Replay TV which has a SVIDEDO and composite output. After purchasing the tv and hooking it up to my Replay via the SVIDEO input, the picture quality was poor with far to much pixelation. Tried all the different screen modes to no avail. Returned the tv the same day as I am not ready to retire my replay units. This tv may be fine for HD (which is the picture they have on display in the store), but if you are going to hook up older video equipment to it that outputs SVIDEO or composite video, you will be disapointed with the picture. The pixelation on these inputs becomes annoying whether you are 3 ft away or 6. I had much higher hopes for this tv.","Date":"October 1, 2006"}
{"Title":"be careful","Author":"Joseph Nicholas","ReviewID":"RGFEYF794670Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I was hoping that this would be ready to go when it arrived at my house- be forewarned you need a high def cable box- the tv won't even work with a standard box.  When I got the new box, I was really dismayed to see that in the manual that to \"Connect to a box that descrambles some channels\" you need 6 lengths of rf cable a cable splitter, and an rf A/B switch. The owners manual then says that these products can be purchased at \"most electronics stores\".  I had to visit 3 stores before I was able to get the RF A/B switch- Circuit City, and PC Richard & Sons did not have it.  I'm guessing that 90% of the people buying this television do not have a cable box that descrambles all channels.  I was really under the impression that this would be ready to go and I am really dismayed that Amazon does not even offer these items as an accessory to the television.  I called Samsung to see if there was any way around this and they told me that there wasn't and that the retailer should have mentioned it- yet there is no mention of this in the product description that Amazon offers.  When I finally got around to setting up the tv I wasn't quite as happy with the picture as I should have been, so I called Samsung and they said that this cable connection was not as good and that to get the best picture I should use component cables- these came with the high def cable box, and yet a Samsung rep told me that I needed the rf a/b switch!  The owners manual makes no mention of using the component cables in lieu of the rf cables & the splitter & the rf a/b switch.Now my only problem is that the television does not show the picture on the full screen size- on my 26\" tv, the picture when I'm watching a wide screen movie is only 10\" high and 19\" wide.  There are two stripes that are light grey and run down the edges of the screen- not black, light grey- very distracting.Neither Samsung or Time Warner will take responsibility for it.  I suspect that it is Time Warner as they have terrible customer assistance, and I set up an appointment on Tuesday.  If the cable guy can't fix it then I'm going to call Samsung on a speaker phone and let those two guys hash it out.","Date":"June 22, 2006"}

OK, the analogue input may not be brilliant, but I don't think its worse that what I got on the older TVs we had.  And the picture with the DVD with digital input is fabulous.  Sound is fine also; the controls and the menus are intuitive and easy.As long as it holds up, I'm going to be very glad I got this one.Two small complaints:  the manual left out something about hooking up the dvd that I found on the samsung website - you may need to change the player's mode of output if you are starting with component cables.  AND it took me quite a while to find out how to use the codes for other devices.  OK, you input them, but how??  And what was said doesn't seem to work.  But given the quality of the set, I really don't count these as worth any minus points.If you get stuck at some point, try the samsung website.

{"Title":"Samsung 26\" HDTV  Is Great!","Author":"Creeksidehiker","ReviewID":"R37115YZ5GKVGN","Overall":"good","Content":"After much research and many trips to the big box stores, I bought the Samsung 26\" HDTV from Amazon for use in a bedroom with viewing distance of 12 feet.  Amazon's free shipping offer and no sales tax resulted in 25% lower cost than any walk-in store.  Extended warranties are not recommended by Consumer Reports, etc, because these HDTVs have outstanding reliability, so that made me more comfortable with a no-warranty internet order.  Amazon stated 5-10 business days shipping, but after just 2 days, the UPS guys were at my doorstep handing me the box.  I attached the base and hooked up the set in about 30 minutes.  It worked perfectly on my 90-channel non-HD cable service.  A month later the cable company installed our HD box ($9/month rental) and the 20 HD channels are fantastic.  The superbowl game was incredibly sharp.  At first, channel switching was slightly slower than I'm used to, but with the HD box it is back to normal (fast).  I chose Samsung for its brilliant picture quality.  Once that was decided, my quandry was picture size.  I started at 20\", then 23\", then settled on 26\".  Although the viewing is ok for a small room, 32\" would have been even better, but it would have dwarfed our room.  If you are undecided, go larger.  The 16:9 HD format requires a much larger nominal size than the old 4:3 standard def.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.","Date":"February 9, 2007"}
{"Title":"5 Stars for Samsung \"Surpassing The Rest\"","Author":"Chris E","ReviewID":"R2EJ317GFM5IVU","Overall":"good","Content":"First up, this TV is gorgeous! The piano-black finish really enhances the picture and brings out the deep blacks in the high-contrast images.  The picture can't be beat (and I did a ton of comparison shopping -- in-store & online).  The TV is super-slim compared to the competitors - its awesome to look at even when it's \"off\".  Call me shallow, but I was concerned as to how the TV would look in my room & truth of the matter is that I couldn't be more pleased.  I feel like I bought a piece of art!Picture-detail and colors are amazing!  Vibrant, crystal-clear images -- high-tech/theater quality.  The menu is great too; its really user-friendly and allows a ton of options so that you can customize picture/sound settings to your meet your preferences.  It's simple to set-up, so no need to hire a pro.My only concern was the speakers; and I'm sad to say, they leave alot to be desired.  I had hoped the 2 \"hidden\" 5 watt speakers would be sufficient for my small room, but they proved to be inferior.  I hear a tinny quality and cannot discern any deapths between the tonal output.  I was so unhappy with the audio that I upgraded by purchasing samsung's mid-priced home theater-in-a-box (Q45).  After doing so, I have been very pleased & I'm really happy with that decision.  Also, make sure to realize that if the speakers were not internal and tucked into the bottom of the set, it would not look as sleek and stunning as it does.  The benefits of the 51D's sleek design outweighs all of these considerations!The \"glare\" factor you may have read about in other reviews, has NOT proved to be an issue for me.  Granted, the exterior looks 10x better with the lights turned \"off\", but even when they are on, I have not found this to be at all distracting (and I'm really picky about such details, before buying this set I was worried about the possibility of glare since I do alot of watching with my lights \"on\".  Just make sure you dust the set at least 1-2x/month -- not anything too drastic (make sure you buy the lcd cleaner at your local electronics store-- no windex, pledge, or water!)I can't imagine owning a different set.  I'm so happy with this purchase that I would recommend this set to everyone I know.  I don't think as many people would have as much as an issue with the speakers as I did.  My ears are super-sensitive and detect more than the average listener, so don't necessarily weigh my audio criteria against yours -- its a matter of priority (the rest of my family thinks they were great!)  My room is only 10' x 12' but if I had a larger room I would not hesitate to go with the 32\" model.","Date":"February 5, 2007"}

{"Title":"It's always about the setup and the bottom line","Author":"The Unluddited \"Tim\"","ReviewID":"RFROEOVK2EEIZ","Overall":"good","Content":"An excellent set depending on how you set it up and use it.My criteria were:- 24-27\" Wide-screen 16X9 (for small sitting area off kitchen)- High Definition- Integrated HDTV tuner (ATSC)- LCD flat panel with minimum 1366X768 resolution- 8ms response time or better- High contrast to counteract a well-lit area- HDMI input(s)- An excellent picture both in-store and in online reviewsThe Samsung LNS2651D met them all. It's mated to an HDTV satellite receiver (with dish and rooftop HD antenna) and an HD upconverting DVD player. I'm currently receiving about 17 HD channels including the \"major networks\", HBO, Showtime, Discovery, TNT, and a couple of ESPNs. This is important because it covers a pretty high percentage of our TV time. If you're watching the CNN and the Weather Channel 90% of the time, this set's probably overkill...look for a 4:3 EDTV and save your money. On the other hand, if primetime major network is your thing, the ATSC tuner should give you a good supply of HD quality viewing without satellite so long as your antenna setup is up to the task.This Samsung really shines in high definition, where many movies and shows leap out at you with an almost 3D image. It's wonderful with widescreen DVD, especially the HD or HD upconverting players. Colors are true, vibrant, and well-defined. Ghosting hasn't been observed, even in fast action sports, with the low response time. Contrast, brightness, and other video adjustments may initially be necessary to get an optimal picture, this is especially true with standard definition sources. Blacks are generally well done, with the caveat that some detail within blacks can be lost, especially if the overall scene is dark. No edge problems are apparent; convergence settings look good out of the box. Its 170 degree viewing angle seems as advertised and the picture doesn't easily wash out, even with too much sunshine in the room.The LNS2651D is good-to-very good in standard definition with a 4:3 aspect ratio (no fan of stretching/cropping the picture, so it's black bars on the sides for me!), about what you'd expect from 480i channels on an LCD. The mandatory noise reduction/picture enhancement circuitry (DNIe) generally works well but the inability to disengage it (without some service menu trickery) is a bit of a disadvantage but even then, it only seems to be a slight problem with low definition material.Audio quality isn't bad for what it is, small built-in speakers on a thin TV. The sound isn't tinny or shrill, but its not exactly room filling either. You do get some traces of the \"SRS Tru-Surround\" audio effects with movies and other programs at times, but if you're looking for theater-like audio....you know the drill, that's a separate purchase.Fit and finish on the LNS2651D is remarkable with the glossy piano-black cabinet; an exquisite-looking television. Careful searches have revealed no dead or ailing pixels on this screen, which is always a relief. The set is also attached to an articulating arm (separate purchase) allowing it to be turned completely perpendicular to its wall position. Using an HDMI connection means only three wires (two HDMIs and power) run through the wall, the arm, and then to the panel instead of 4 to 6 or more wires with other configurations.The off-kitchen area went from a mammoth 19\" CRT with the rudimentary satellite receiver to a wall mounted articulating 26\" widescreen HD flat panel with an HD satellite receiver and an HD upconverting DVD player. This setup was completely wired and installed for a little under $1,200...not bad when the MSRP is $100 more than that on the LCD TV alone. Buying online really makes a difference. The Samsung LNS2651D is recommended for HD and DVD lovers without reservation. You'll not be disappointed.","Date":"January 27, 2007"}

I am 18, and this will end up going to college with me, so it is a perfect dorm size.  I am using it primarily for my Playstation 3, and with HDMI cables and 5.1 surround sound, let me tell you, I am in heaven.  Picture quality is amazing, not as good as some larger TV's but they have a size and resolution advantage (1080p versus 720p)  Going from SD to HD with my PS3 games is like night to day.  Also, I never knew DVD's could look so amazing.  I only have one Blu Ray disc, and as expected, great picture quality.  One small issue I noticed was that in certain situations there is a bit of a flicker, but I am sure this has nothing to do with the TV itself, but more LCD as a technology.  Also I noticed some strange effects on very dark scenes but this was fixed by lowering the backlight brightness.The fit and finish of this set is top notch.  It has a glossy black surface that catches the light and looks stunning.  (Especially since it matches the my PS3 =)  The plugs on the back of the TV are really stuck on there, no loose fittings here.  Unfortunately there is no DVI port, but a DVI>HDMI converter should cover you for your computer monitor needs.  The Menu is easy to navigate and helpful.  The remote is great, I love the way it fits in my hand, however it is a bit long, may need to shift your hand around to get some of the buttons, but unless you are very very lazy this should be a nonissue.Overall I am very satisfied, and feel that this TV was well worth my money.  It is a pleasure to look at and a pleasure to use.  The only gripes I have are that the power cord is a bit too short, and the case will show dust and smudges like nobody's business.","Date":"February 15, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great TV..Great Value..screen background not as black as Sony","Author":"Mark in Illinois","ReviewID":"R2XVOMPB2VLJHZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Purchased this TV because my wife wouldn't let me get a bigger unit for the Living room. She thought 32\" or more would be overpowering. So, as usual, I let her have her way. This TV was well recommended already and I have always had great luck with Samsung Electronics in the past (Video, DVD players, disk drives, monitors). It performs well and for the price is a great set. We have it hooked up to DirectTV and the picture is crystal clear digital and our Playstation 3 performs terrific as a High Definition Blue-Ray player. The only drawbacks are that the screen background is not that black, at least not as black when compared to a Sony high-end set. Also the viewing angles are a little limited and the sound is a little wimpy from the built in speakers. However, most people now have in home theater systems so that point is probably not very important. All in all, a dependable tv for a reasonable price. Not exactly the best, but definitely above the rest.","Date":"March 19, 2009"}

{"Title":"Ok for digital input, mediocre for analog","Author":"J. Lahue","ReviewID":"RCVTHGKVQMNYI","Overall":"good","Content":"TV is ok with an analog cable input.  I didn't expect brilliance with this TV for analog signals.  The biggest disappointment with this TV is how limited the PIP is.  If you are viewing an analog signal on the main display, then the PIP only works with an HDMI input source.  If using the AV1 or S-Video input on main display, PIP only works with digital TV or HDMI input.  If using digital TV on main display, PIP only works with AV1, S-Video or Component input.  PIP only has real choices if the main display is showing something from an HDMI input.  So if you are interested in this TV (and it is really good for digital input), then unless you have an HDMI input source, PIP is a useless feature.Also note that if you are using an analog input (such as cable), then channel changes are very slow.  Most TVs have an almost instantaneous channel change.  Here, it takes about 2 seconds to flip to the next channel.  If you are rapid channel flipper (like I am) than you have to learn to be patient with the TV.","Date":"December 3, 2006"}

I was really nervous ordering something this big on amazon because you cant return this 'cuz amazon has only in home warranty repair on TV's. Even though amazon has this policy where the ordered TV should be unpack on delivery and you should inspect if there something broken, you can refuse to sign so there wouldnt be a burden on you because you cant return the TV... or something like that. Anyhow, when he were about to give me his portable thingy to sign, I ask him if he were instructed to unpack this, and he said he's only here for delivery, so I signed.  I inspected the box, it looks like its well taken care, I unpack and connected it thru my PC, I open up pixel detector buddy and carefully inspected dead pixels, there were NONE. I open up bunch of video files and this TV has gorgeous black, the colors are great. Exterior looks great, it has glossy piano black exterior. I was opting for 32 inch of the same model but amazon.com doesn't ship to Hawaii. This TV is just a bit bigger than my 2407FPW Dell monitor. The speaker a bit weak, but then again, for its size, this is just good only for small rooms and not on living room, yeah I use this on my room. My only consolation for TV is that I hope to get the Mustang wall mount for free via rebate. I would have bought 32\" model on reputable store on pricegrabber.  What I hate about this TV is the headphone jack, would been great if they put it on the side. PIP isnt a dual tuner PIP, you cant have 2 TV station on your TV at once. Its either a tuner and other TV inputs. This thing should last about 3 or 4 years or until LCD TV can do full 1080 resolution.[...]","Date":"July 27, 2006"}

Martin \"altar ego\"","ReviewID":"R1JZRZICWNOMKR","Overall":"good","Content":"The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The \"Piano Black\" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.

{"Title":"Great TV. Very impressed with Samsung so far.","Author":"matteo","ReviewID":"RI8TPG7QVO3ZW","Overall":"good","Content":"I went into my local Circuit City recently intending to look at the Sharp Aquos LC-32D40U. I had heard so much abou the Aquos TVs and how good they were. Since it was on sale I came close to buying it. But the Samsung LNS3241D was sitting right next to the Sharp on the rack and I immediately noticed that the Samsung's picture just looked a whole lot better. Compared to the Samsung, I couldn't believe how washed out the blacks were on the Sharp. I even played with the controls on the Sharp to make sure it's settings weren't messed up. It became very clear that the Samsung has a way better contrast ratio...in fact it pretty much looked the best out of all the other 32\" TVs on display except for maybe the Sony XBR which is twice the price. So I picked up the Samsung and have loved it ever since. Mine didn't have a single burnt pixel out of the box. The built in speakers are pretty respectable. When having friends over to watch movies...they have asked if all that sound was coming from the TV's speakers. The picture quality is great with Comcast HD and with DVDs. It's awesome to have an LCD with such deep, rich blacks, but my only complaint is that sometimes the darks are a bit too dark. It may just be a setting issue. I haven't tried seriously to fix it because it doesn't bother me that much. I was also blown away by the quality I was able to get hooking up my laptop computer to the TV. since the PC connector is just VGA and not DVI, I thought \"this is going to look like crap\" but it looks great...extreamly crisp and clear. The TV. could very well be used as a computer monitor too. All in all, I'm a very happy camper...except for the fact that Amazon's price is now cheaper than Circuit City's sale price! aarrgh. Oh well. It's a great TV.","Date":"April 30, 2006"}

I've been waiting a several years for prices to go down and my preferences were Sony, Sharp, or Samsung. Sonys are still too expensive. The Sharp Aquos' picture was poor in comparison to either the Sony or Samsung. I was surprised since Sharps have good buzz. I originally wanted last year's model--329D, but oddly that model was more expensive. Initial consumer reviews were good about the 324 and the price was right. There were cheaper prices on the Internet but the store names were not familar to me and I didn't want to lose my money. As I was checking out, a popup offered a free trial to Amazon Prime. I got it shipped overnight for $3--sweet. Arrived in perfect condition, beaucoup connection ports, great picture, and I don't even have HDTV yet. The pic tends to be dark but that can be changed in the settings. As someone mentioned, it's so minor it's not worth bothering with unless you're a perfectionist.

{"Title":"A lightweight LCD with a powerful picture","Author":"Tyson CN Becker","ReviewID":"RSTY6VHOZ33NE","Overall":"good","Content":"Recieved this Samsung LCD two days ago and I have to say for the price, this TV is hard to beat.  I knew I was buying a 32 inch LCD for about 2 months and researched the Sharp Aquos model, the Sony XBR, and this one.  After much research and comparing of pictures I felt the Samsung was the best combination of price and picture.  The Sony XBR will give you a better picture, no doubt, but it is not such a jump that is justifies spending the $900 more to buy it.  I also thought the Sharp Aquos's picture looked a little washed out compared to this Samsung.I've been told that seeing TV's on display at Best Buy and Circuit City is a bad way to go about this because store managers tend to turn up the contrast or brightness on the TV's.  I never have understood this theory, I mean maybe they are trying to get rid of some inventory or something of that nature but has anyone tried playing with their brightness and/or contrast balance on thier TV's?  It helps but it doesn't make a crappy picture brilliant or vice versa.  Therefore when I went to Best Buy and saw the picture on the Samsung compared to the Sharp it was a no brainer for me which TV had the better picture.Anyways back to the actual TV.  I have Brighthouse Cable TV and run an HDMI cord from my Scientific Atlanta HD DVR to the TV and the picture is brilliant.  The HD picture is amazing, the first thing I turned to was HBO HD and Spiderman 2 was playing.  I watched the last half of it in amazment because the picture was that good.  My father in law and my father both have the 32 inch Sony XBR and although I did not have them side to side I felt the Samsung's HD picture was just as colorful and vibrant as the Sony XBR.The biggest differance I noticed between the XBR and this Samsung was how they handled SD TV.  The Sony is in my opinion is significantly better at handling SD TV than this Samsung (although the Samsung is also good).  Not only can it decode it better, it also has a screen streach called Wide Zoom (i think that's the name) that can actually put SD TV at 16:9 ratio and make it look very good.  The Samsung cannot do that and either can my cable box.  I can fill the screen but it becomes stretched beyond the border and look odd.  So I just watch SD in regular 4:3, which looks good, and let the HD shine when I turn it to my HD channels.I also ran my iBook G4 through the TV via the 15 pin VGA connector.  Looks amazing.  I've tried to run my iBook through other LCD before and it has never looked nearly as good as it does on this TV.  A great bonus because it wasn't really a factor in my buying decision.Last but not least I have my audio running from my cable box to my reciever so I have not really tested the speakers on this TV.  Sorry!Anyways in conclusion.  Great HD picture.  Two HDMI hookups which will give you a little bit of futureproof (Sony XBR only has 1)!  Very lightweight (I was very, very surprised at how light the actually TV is, you could carry it with one hand!) Easy to put the stand on and very easy to get working.  A great TV that is impossible to beat at the price Amazon is offering it for.  Go for it!PS  I would give this TV 4.5 stars if possible for the simple fact that the Sony XBR plays SD better.  However like I said earlier in my review it's not worth an extra $900.","Date":"May 26, 2006"}
{"Title":"Fantastic LCD TV from Samsung","Author":"Voltron00x \"Elias\"","ReviewID":"R1GAZ5AIFZK2UV","Overall":"good","Content":"I was able to score a great deal on this TV - online, for $800 on Thanksgiving.  It took me four weeks to actually have it show up at my house (note that this wasn't ordered from Amazon.com), but its been worth the wait.  Out of the box, the TV is very sleek and attractive.  I have it hooked up to my DVR Cable Box via HDMI, which looks fantastic.  The HD channels are absolutely amazing to watch - I've watched NFL games, NBA, Dexter on Showtime, etc and they all look great.  Non-HD channels vary in quality - some are pretty ugly.  It helps to actually turn down the brightness / sharpness when watching regular TV.  Unless you're very close to the TV, thoguh, its not like its unwatchable.I also have a Sony Up-converting DVD Player hooked up through the second HDMI.  So far, I've used this to watch Pirates of the Caribbean 2, and Cars.  I watch Pirates first - the menu screen was awfully ugly, as was the movie itself.  For a few minutes, I was getting terribly disappointed - but its all a matter of playing around with settings.  Once I had the TV and DVD player set up correctly (which took about 10 minutes of trial and error) I found the right settings, and WOW.  Pirates looked absolutely INCREDIBLE.  You'd never know it was a regular DVD and not HD programing.  Ditto for Cars - so just a heads up, you DEFINITELY need to play with the settings on both the TV and whatever is outputting to the screen to make sure you have the right display settings.  I hooked the DVD player to my Sony surround system using a Digital Optical cable - the sound is great.Attached to the surround system are a PS2 and Nintendo Gamecube.  The surround system is hooked up to the regular A/V on the TV.  Playing videogames on this TV, even \"last gen\" games, is not a problem at all.  The graphics still look great - really it depends on the game's resolution more than anything.  A second digital optical cord runs from the TV to the Surround system, so any sound coming from the TV is muted and sent to the surround.  This is great, as it means everything I have hooked up will always play out of my surround speakers (cable TV, videogames, DVDs, etc).Finally, I have an Xbox 360 hooked up via the Component cables.  One of the reasons I wanted this TV is that Gamestop uses Samsung LCD monitors in their stores, and the 360s running there looked fantastic.  This TV has a \"Game Mode\" - and its awesome.  I was already playing Gears of War every day - now I can hardly put it down.  To say the graphics are incredible is an understatement.  To anyone who felt the 360 wasn't really \"next-gen\" enough, you need to play the games on an HD screen to really appreciate it.  The 360 also has a $199.99 HD-DVD add-on, which I couldn't pass up once I got the tv.  It comes with King Kong, which I thought was so-so as a film.  The HD-DVD itself is a great player, but I wasn't as \"Wowed\" by the video quality as I expected.  I need to try it again with a movie I like more, I suppose - V for Vendetta, Batman Begins, Superman Returns, and Serenity are all available for HD-DVD and I expect they'll look awesome.  I have to say though, if you pick up this TV, definitely pick up an up-converting HD-DVD player - I strongly recommend a Sony with HDMI capability, because it looks incredible and only set me back $100.I couldn't be happier with this TV.  In a few years, once 1080p TVs are cheaper, I'll upgrade and mount this one on a wall - this TV is very light by the way.  As its LCD, its relatively hassle-free - no worrying about burn-out or break-in periods.However, I have two small disappointments with this TV, both of which I expected due to the LCD format.  The viewing angles on this TV, compared to my old 32\" Flatscreen TV by Toshiba, are definitely not as good.  Don't get me wrong - they're not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but just not as good as my old \"regular\" TV was.  In addition, this TV definitely won't display dark, \"rich\" Black like a Plasma TV can.  When watching a Widescreen DVD, the \"black\" bars aren't quite as Black as I'm used to.  Its an issue with the LCD format, unfortunately - that's the price you pay for being able to leave your TV paused all day without concern.All told, I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  When doing my initial set-up, I had some issues getting the TV to detect my cable - just a heads-up, this TV can be a little cranky at times when it comes to detecting inputs if its already turned on.  Just turn it off and turn it on again if you've plugged or unplugged anything, and it'll catch them.  I called Samsung and didn't have to wait at all for customer service - they were great.If you're looking to pick up a mid-size, quality LCD HD TV, I can't recommend this thing enough.  Just be prepared to spend a little extra dough on HDMI cables and an up-converting DVD player.","Date":"December 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"Appealing picture quality, watching HD programming is niiice","Author":"W. Lynn","ReviewID":"RH0L47UZI02MN","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the first TV I've bought in a long long time, and I really wanted something that was fairly close to the cutting edge of technology.We (my wife and I) choose this model from a retailer storefront after deciding on LCD over plasma (don't need anything too big as we're in a 1 bedroom apartment) and over rear projection TVs (too fuzzy) and finding this price point acceptable. After this decision, we filtered out models to Sharp, Sony and Samsung based on looking at the pictures in-store. We looked not only at this model but at other size LCD TVs of the various brands and found as a general trend that we preferred the picture quality of these brands. I also liked the feature list although it's not quite as nice as it seems...Anyway, the best things about this are-The PICTURE! It does look great to my eyes and although of course this is subjective, I've really enjoyed watching HD programming and DVDs on this unit. I've never watched so much TV before.-The black finish, so pictures appear clearer and with better contrast (I don't see why TVs are made with silver frames, who cares if the TV looks good if it distracts from the brightness of the picture).-The built-in stereo speakers are decent.-Finally, I haven't noted any broken pixels (my pet gripe).The only problem of note we've had: With certain operations from our cable box there is a slight delay can confuse the TV and you pretty much have to do nothing for a couple secs before the TV stabilises. You get a large grey square on the screen during this time. I think its due to switching between channels/sources that are HD/SD (it think it autodetects the signal and adjusts the picture accordingly, and when you change too quickly the TV can't keep up).Other gripes (all fairly minor):Some features are not as full-featured as you might imagine, but you can't really tell without reading the manual. For example:1. Picture-in-Picture only works with different sources. You can't watch two channels from the same source using PiP. This makes the PiP feature close to useless for general TV viewing. (Fortunately, your cable box may have this feature anyway - mine does.)2. The computer input is limited to a standard VGA connector, not DVI. (There are HDMI inputs, yes, but these are different sources and the manual specifically states that these HDMI inputs can't be used for computers.)3. There is only one component video input. This is a bit limiting because all of your a/v devices (e.g. DVD player) might not have HDMI connections yet. If you want this level of video quality from say, both your DVD player and cable box you'd have to get yourself a component video switch (or unplug/re-plug 3 cables each time). When I first checked the specs on this model I didn't expect to be limited with connections.Overall, a very worthwhile purchase. I hope the lamp life is good so I can keep this TV for many years to come.","Date":"June 13, 2006"}
{"Title":"Superb performance, incredible value for price!","Author":"M. Sullivan","ReviewID":"R3F3O3I49L8DZD","Overall":"good","Content":"After much research into HD displays in our price range, I happily decided on the Samsung 32\" 41 series for our first foray into high definition viewing. Amazon of course was much less expensive than any local electronics or reputable online retailer by far. It arrived last week and we're thrilled with it. Our living room isn't huge, so it's the perfect size. It's just big enough for a great home theater experience, but not too big that it dominates the room. If you're looking for a TV that fits that criteria, 32\" is definitely the way to go.Just to reiterate what others have said, the TV is a bit dark out of the box, but a quick adjustment of the brightness setting alleviates that. Once you have all the settings to your liking, the picture is fantastic - very bright and sharp, with extremely vibrant colors. There is noticable trailing on the DTV stations occasionally, but that's to be expected with an LCD display. We've watched four DVDs already, and I've played several Xbox 360 games, and I haven't noticed any display quirks on either (I didn't even use the \"Game Mode\" and experienced no lag on my games). I'm using a component connection for the 360, because it doesn't have HDMI output, and games and movies in progressive scan look amazing. They say HDMI is the best, but I don't know how it could get any better. It would have been nice to have more than one component input, so I don't have to use the 360 for movies, but oh well.We pick up all the local stations in HD with a set of bunny ears, and they look great (besides the above mentioned trailing). Plus, there are a few stations we didn't even realize were broadcast, including 24-hour weather and music video stations. Bonus!The SRS TruSurround XT seems to be all hype--the sound is average at best. I definitely recommend hooking up the TV or your DVD player to a seperate speaker system as I did. It's also a bit disappointing that the Picture-In-Picture only works with two different input sources, so you can't watch two different TV stations at the same time. The remote is very easy to use and set up--it works seamlessly with my Samsung audio receiver, so I only need to use the one remote.Overall, my wife and I are completely satisfied with our purchase. The small negative points I've brought out in this review should be expected, and are moot against the overall performance of this display. If this is the type of TV you're in the market for, I don't see any reason not to get this one.","Date":"June 19, 2006"}

It was advertised for free \"prime\" shipping.Others have stated otherwise, but my \"Prime\" shipping was changed to \"ground\" shipping. Not only that, but my 5 day ground shipping took 9 days to get to me. GRRRR.....Amazon shipped it via Eagle (egl).Having questioned the issue, Amazon has side stepped several times. They now offer free shipping, at your guess. They have since taken it off \"prime\" shipping status.It's a great tv, and well worth the money.

{"Title":"Samsung - Hard to Beat it","Author":"G. Durbin","ReviewID":"R2PZKOWPO2EVQE","Overall":"good","Content":"We looked at many LCD TVs at the local retail outlets. That is the only way to buy any LCD TV.  They tend to have the lowest end units on one end of the row and the best ones down at the other end. At the high end were Sony and Samsung units. Both were beautiful. As I already have a Samsung 21\" 213T SyncMaster PC monitor, I knew I would like Samsung. Honestly, the Sony had a more appealing bezel with it's high tech silver appearance. But what do you watch when you watch TV? I look at the screen. And Samsung was a little better.This LNS3241D unit is great. I have not owned any LCD TVs before this one, but I am very particular with anything that shows a picture. You won't be disappointed if you get this television. I live in a metro area and run it off of rabbit ears! No cable required to get instant HDTV. (A better antenna will only improve your experience, however).I also got the Mustang wall mount at the same time. Not required, but it is a substantial piece of equipment that will securely support your expensive TV.Best of all, and why I got it here, was that Amazon couldn't be beaten for best overall combined price/shipping/tax. And with Amazon, you know you will not get ripped off.","Date":"June 3, 2006"}
{"Title":"Beautiful in HD, solid -- although not perfect -- performance","Author":"Paul Stuart \"\"...also I'll brush my teeth...","ReviewID":"R2JFKB4HGYUICM","Overall":"good","Content":"Echoing several reviewers of the LNS3241D, I too held out on taking the HD plunge until purchasing this item. Simply put, I was waiting for: a) a more digestable price point for an HD set, and b) better functionality than earlier HD models. The Samsung LSN3241D certainly delivers on both accounts.Picture-wise, the LNS3241D is a stunner. Comparing nearly 10 similar units at a local Best Buy left the LNS3241D as the clear (pun intended) winner in this area. The 3000:1 contrast ratio goes a long way over competitors in the 700:1 and 800:1 range. Brightness and color spectrum contrasts are clear, in-program text a pleasure on the eyes (a must for sports programming). Related and for what its worth, I did not, however, perceive any immediate difference between Samsung's 3000:1 and 4000:1 contrast ratio sets (despite significant price point disparities.Warning: to truly maximize this unit, be prepared to spend hundreds dollars more on a TDMI cable. This expense + a wall mounting bracket (another $60-100 tab), however, proved well worth the money for HD programming (via Time Warner Cable with an TDMI output on their box). Only a few weeks in I admittedly and already feel deprived on standard programming channels, although 1080i mode gives these channels a nice boost.Audio in HD programming -- thanks to the TDMI cable -- is likewise crisp and rich. Worth noting, however, is that at 1/3rd volume levels some popping occurs through the TV's speakers. The much lauded Samsung sound system is solid but no Sony WEGA technology in this area (arguably the WEGA line's greatest asset).Second, the LNS3241D -- via a Time Warner, Scientific Atlanta HD DVR cable box -- has one critical flaw worth noting: it is incapable of intelligently resizing standard programming into widescreen. Be prepared to watch these channels in standard squares (vs. widescreen) with black bars sorrounding the frame. Zooming into widescreen mode (to overcome this flaw) distorts the picture, not recommended for detail-phobics [such as myself].Putting these flaws into perspective, however, the LNS3241D is a steal from a price versus feature perspective. Sharp (beautiful  picture) and Magnavox (nice all-around set) units can be had at comparitive price points, but both lack the functionality, technological compatibility, and quality control Samsung offers. This is not to say I wouldn't have loved a Sony WEGA; simply not worth -- in my opinion -- the 20-30% higher base price for this line.The subject header says it all for me. At this price and for my needs -- a mid-range, robust HD set -- the LNS3241D is a winner.","Date":"July 27, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great TV, great bargain, but maybe not the best for picky gamers","Author":"B. Lama","ReviewID":"R26N87NZQD3UT0","Overall":"bad","Content":"Okay first let me say that most everything the other reviewers have said about this TV is true. I too saw this TV on display at Circuit City side by side with other LCD flat panels from Sony, Sharp and others, and looking at them all running the same video the Samsung picture quality was as good as or better than any of them, to my eyes. The only other TV's that were even close were the Sony (didn't look as good as the Samsung, but cost several hundred more), and a higher end Samsung of the same size (a couple hundred more for increased contrast ratio from 3000:1 to 4000:1, I can't say I saw a difference).The price was fantastic for this type of TV with the features it has. Circuit City just happened to have one available as an \"Open Box Deal\", a customer return or something to that effect. The TV was still in brand spanking new condition, still had the remote, manual, and everything, just no box, and I got it for $200 off their list price, so I payed about $1200. I expected to be paying more like $1500-1800 for a 32\" LCD HDTV to get a nice picture, so I went home that day very pleased with my purchase.Well... the TV is great and will probably satisfy 95% of people out there who want to upgrade to HDTV and/or flat panel. I, unfortunately, am one of the other 5%.The problem for me is that I primarily bought the TV to play video games on. And I am very picky about the picture when I'm playing games. Little things that might not bother most people can be a real annoyance to me.Issue #1 - Though much improved over what I was used to seeing with older LCD monitors, and even with Samsung boasting a lightning-fast repsonse time of 8ms (one of the fastest I've seen advertised, only the Aquos is advertised faster that I know of at 6ms), there was still VERY noticeable blurring of finer details when things were moving. I hooked up an Xbox 360 and ran a first person game (Elder Scrolls: Oblivion for you gamers), which is a gorgeous and VERY finely detailed game. In an outdoor scene, I immediately noticed that when I would move, all the fine details like all of the individual leaves on trees or blades of grass would go out of focus very noticeably. And then when I would stop moving it would take a split second for everything to get back in focus. Even my wife, who is about 10,000x less picky about things like that and often doesn't notice things I complain about on TV pictures, asked why it was doing that before I even pointed it out to her! A sign to me that it is actually something the average person will notice easily.Issue #2 - While this TV does offer a very high contrast ratio (3000:1 claimed) that does look very good in scenes where you have a very bright colorful scene or a mixed light and dark colored scene, I found that it does NOT look good on primarily dark scenes. If the scene is mostly dark with just a small portion of light/colorful/white elements, the lighter elements will appear cloudy or greyish. Perfect example, I popped in Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2, and the first screen is all black with one line of large white text in the center, and the white text should be a bright bright white, instead it was a dingy light grey. Another example from the same game, when you are viewing the car buying screen where the background is mostly black and dark grey, a bright colored car like a yellow or red will appear washed out or greyish instead of vibrant.Which seems to be an effect of Issue #3... What it appears to me is that the backlight of the LCD trys to adapt by adjusting brighter for mostly bright scenes and dimming for mostly darker scenes. It is very noticeable when the scene shifts rapidly from dark to light, you will see the scene shift, and then a split second later you will see the whole screen brightness level very suddenly change.This 'blinking' along with the fact that a mostly dark screen with colorful elements will show the colors to be washed out and very low contrast looking means that, although you are USUALLY getting a great, high contrast and very vibrant picture, in the end it is a very unconsistently great picture. Add to that the blurring effect and I am very unsatisified with this TV as far as playing games on it. And I have spent HOURS adjusting every possible setting for the picture with no luck of alleviating these issues.I am left to wonder if maybe this TV isn't maybe defective in some way, hence why it was an \"Open Box Deal\" to begin with. BUT, I have done a lot of reading online since buying this TV and found that at least the issue of the blurring seems to be a well known and commonly accepted issue with LCD's. As I said, I just be one of the extreme minority of picky consumers. As far as the blinking issue, the way it happens it seems to be a purposeful design, not some type of defect.Lastly, I should mention that I am also a fan of older video games (think Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis), and when I hooked a couple of these older systems up to this TV the picture just looked horrible, but I think this is just an effect of running a very low resolution image on such a high resolution TV, which is something you hear people complain about when viewing regular, non digital TV signals on HDTV's as well, so is not really a fault of this particular TV.Now, with all that having been mentioned, I will say that when I popped in a couple DVD movies, the TV performed beautifully, very nice, sharp, colorful picture. Were I only a movie buff who wanted a nice 'home theater' experience but didn't have space or money for one of the truly large HDTV's, this TV would work perfectly. So for anyone who is just looking for exactly that, watching and movies and regular TV, I would rate the TV a 5 for having a wonderful picture, great features, tons of inputs, and being an excellent value.But for playing video games, I can only rate the TV a 2. And since I rarely ever even watch TV, and I use my TV probably 80% for video gaming, I am unhappy and will be returning this TV today and getting a large screen Sony Wega CRT TV. The Wega line, by the way, still has what I consider to be the BEST picture available for any type of gaming. I had a 27\" Wega for five years and absolutely loved it.","Date":"August 2, 2006"}

{"Title":"Best Picture Quality on the Market!","Author":"A. M. Hernandez","ReviewID":"R1V3WGBAT2UUGS","Overall":"good","Content":"I just purchased this TV from a local Circuit City on sale for $999 ($100 more than Amazon's current price). I did a lot of research and this TV or other Samsung's in the same line have the best picture quality on the market *for any price*. Even the Sony LCDs that went for almost double this price actually have Samsung screens in them, so go figure. The images are crystal clear on 1080i and the black levels and color reproduction are spot on. You literally cannot go wrong with this TV.  I primarily play video games on this TV, I got it just for my Xbox360. The games look amazing on this TV. The graphics look better than I have ever seen them before. Text in games like Dead Rising is totally sharp and readable. Some games, like PGR, almost look real. Gears of War looks simply unbelievable. Samsung included a 'game mode' on the TV with help from Microsoft engineers which optimizes the picture for Xbox360 HD. It really gives the image a vibrant more arcade look to it.  Don't cheap out and get one of those off-brand HDTVs, its worth the investment. I have seen LCD HDTVs my friends got from random off-brands and there is a noticable difference. Something about the picture on this TV just makes it \"pop\" more. Some games almost look like 3d. Watching HD discovery channel makes you feel like you are looking out a window on a plane, its that real. Also, the Samsungs handle SD content very well compared to any other LCD HD on the market. I watched some standard DVDs and they almost looked like HD-DVD on this screen. On cheaper sets the SD picture looks very blurry and grainy with compression artifacts. Not here. Everything I plugged in (via component cables) looked great. Even the Nintendo Wii connected through composite still looked decent. Standard SD broadcast programming looked pretty good as well, not much different than watching on a high-end SDTV.If you are looking for an LCD HDTV for under $1000, then this is definately the TV you want to get. Like I said, I have been to multiple stores and looked at just about every HDTV line on the market and this one is the best overall. The picture quality out-of-box is great and after tweaking a few settings it looked amazing. There are a few small annoyances, like it having only one component input, but otherwise its a great TV. The picture is great, the sound is decent, it has a nice remote, the case is very nice looking. I literally couldnt be happier with this TV. I would recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade to HD. Like I said before, you can't go wrong with this TV.","Date":"December 3, 2006"}

While it is hard to trust these retailers with proper calibration of the picture, the Samsung LNS3241D 32\" LCD blew away the Sony and the Sharp AQUOS 32\" LCD (my second choice).  The 3000:1 contrast ratio is one of the highest available.  The picture is extremely bright...colors are brilliant, great whites, pretty good blacks.  SD picture is ok...much better than my previous Samsung 50\" rear projection hdtv but not the best.  HD picture is awesome-amazing detail and clarity.  I am hooked up via component cables and can't wait for my HDMI cable/Monster Power Center to arrive.  My only gripe with the picture (and it is a minor one) is that the image is so clear you can see a bit of a blur in fast-moving objects-apparently this is common with the LCD technology.  Sound is so-so but if you're spending this much on a TV then buy some speakers for God's sake.  If you want to pay $1500 more for a Sony XBR, go ahead, but for the money this TV is pretty sweet.

The connections on the back were my prime reason for getting it. I reviewed it at a local electronics store and was amazed how much better the picture looked compared to the surrounding LCD tvs. I hooked up an HD cable set top box with an HDMI cable. The resolution is great. It is using 1080i (Does not support 1080p which is the \"progressive\" version).Dvd is connected with a component (RGB) cable. The picture was a little on the darker side which caused problems spotting details in dark (i.e. night) scenes. By increasing the brightness this was resolved. It has several display 'modes' that you can select as presets. This makes switching between brightness modes easy. I also connected a computer to the vga connector (hoping to switch it out to a dvi to hdmi cable soon). The panel supports the computer in 1360x768 widescreen.It also has digital audio (optical) out which I use for all digital 5.1 audio signals (it is easier than connecting seperate cables).Overall I am very pleased with this LCD TV.

Moulton \"Petmo\"","ReviewID":"R1ZRPQ9CD2C4SA","Overall":"good","Content":"My wife and I shopped for two weeks looking at HDTV's in the local stores, CompUSA, BestBuys, Circuit City, RadioShack, BJ's and a couple others. We were almost sold on either the Magnavox or the Olevia based on picture and price until I read the reviews on them. There were horror stories about Phillips products and Olevia was mixed. We decided to look for a deal on Sony, Samsung or Toshiba instead and found one on Amazon for the LNS3241D saving about $400 off list with free shipping, a free Mustang wall mount and interest free payments for 6mos with another $30 off the price with their VISA card. Wow!The set came very quickly and the shippers were great. They unpacked it and offered to take the packaging away.This model has every feature I wanted like the sound lock and the PC connection both of which are great.I had to buy some HDMI cables and an S-video cable to get the best reception but that was it. I did away with the component cables that Verizon FIOS supplied and with that the need to run the cables in the wall. They all fit neatly in a chase I got at Home Depot that is about 2\" wide and 1/4\" deep and mounts on the wall. It is practically invisible on my off-white wall. All in all a great experience and a great product. Very happy with my purchase.","Date":"December 10, 2006"}

{"Title":"excellent intro to LCD flatscreens","Author":"Joshua Hanes \"HYFI\"","ReviewID":"R1ZB0SWCJIL1XZ","Overall":"good","Content":"Not knowing much about the difference between plasma, LCD, widescreen projections, etc. and the money they ask for them, I bought this expecting this to be a safe step into the more expensive, higher end televisions.  I was at first disappointed, but the more I watch this, the more pleased I am with the purchase.  Plasma is obviously high end, but I've heard wicked rumors about how fragile they are.  LCD is very nice and very light and manageable.  The misc. projection televisions afford the larger images at much cheaper prices, but sacrifice weight - what I learned in a nutshell.It has a hook-up for just about anything and everything you can imagine.  Red/Green/Blue things for the high-end video hook-up (I suggest a top-of-the-line DVD player and/or receiver to utilize this), an S-video connection (next best video), two or three standard video hookups (the red/white/yellow, which is the oldest technology), an HDTV hookup (still waiting for the HD cable service) and a PC monitor hookup if you're crazy enough to use this as a monitor.  The energy saving quick-button is nice for quickly adjusting the brightness - I've found that daytime watching vs. nighttime/all lights out movie watching requires it.  The sleep functions toggles in 30min intervals up to 180 minutes for those epic movies.  The biggest gripe I have as someone else did is about the speakers - not the greatest in the world.  They sound ok but if you're expecting any kind of base, get a sound system.  They are adequate for casual watching so you don't have to keep turning on the amp to get solid sound unless you've got 2.3 kids and 1.5 pets.  It will stretch any fullscreen picture to fit the widescreen and keep the settings per input (DVD widescreen vs. TV fullscreen doesn't require a toggle each time you change).Overall, a very user-friendly piece of equipment.  Highly recommended to those who are new to the higher end electronics or for those who already have a giant widescreen and would like something adequate for the bedroom.","Date":"August 12, 2006"}

I like it very much.With the price difference between this model and the LNS3251D, I would probably upgrade. But the price gap was much larger in the retail outlet where I purchased this tv. Also, I'd say I prefer the style the style of this model to the LNS3251D, but that is a very subjective thing.Dead pixels are a worrying thing. I did a lot of research, and have been told these screens have relatively few defects. The one I received was perfect. Until the industry adopts a zero dead pixel policy though, one must be cautious.The screen itself is beautiful. The refresh rate is very good. Movies look great, as do games. If you're going to be running 3d shooters on this... well I'd check it out yourself first... but I could not easily detect smearing and was fairly unsatisfied with some of the earlier lcd screens.The remote and inputs are wonderful. I have never seen this done so simply before. I still haven't looked through every advanced feature, but within an hour I felt pretty comfortable with how everything worked and plugged in. Very pleased with the remote.I've wanted one of these forever. Finally got into the price range I was willing to bite, and I couldn't be happier. Even non hd programming looks and dvds looks quite good. Computer video looks great even through the analog plug. The stretching of video is usually quite good, but sometimes noticable errors seem to occurOn a side note, the speakers are not great. I've heard people comparing the sound to home theatre systems... I have a pair of $100 Klipsch Pro media speakers that put the sound on this tv to shame. The bass from the tv is non existant to horrible. I'm not talking about blasting rap. Just normal music sounds flat and dead... like listening to it on my laptop.Overall I don't think you can go wrong with a Samsung screen for the price.","Date":"July 3, 2006"}

Michael","ReviewID":"RET3Z260FMOB","Overall":"good","Content":"As mentioned by others, the HD picture quality is spectacular.One great feature this TV has, that most others don't, is two separate antenna inputs. This allows you to use both an antenna/rabbit ears for over-the-air HD and also regular cable TV. With most sets, you'd have to use an A-B splitter to switch between the two. So if you have such a setup in mind, or just want to see HD before you commit to expensive digital cable, this set is ideal.This TV has a very nice menu system, good sound, case looks great, lots of inputs.Only flaws, the remote is a bit busy with lots of buttons, and I've found the ON timer sometimes doesn't work on my set.

I love it.  I used every single feature of it and all features work very well.  I really like to use it as a 32\" PC monitor, so bright and the colors are so beautiful.  Another good feature of this HDTV is it has 2 HDMI inputs. I set one up for my Playstation 3 for games and Blu-ray movies and one for my DVD upconvert for my dvd collection without any hazzle of pluging and unpluging in the back of the TV.  I know this HDTV can only go as high as 720P and 1080i, but this is what we need for a long time.  Most HD channels only offer these two resolutions and I don't think majority of viewers can tell the difference between 720p, 1080i and 1080p.  For the price from amazon with free shipping, it is a good deal for the quality you are getting.  Sure you can go buy a 32\" HDTV for $600, but it doesn't have the features that LNS3241D offers.","Date":"March 15, 2007"}

{"Title":"Be Aware of Problems","Author":"gnits \"murderofcrows\"","ReviewID":"R226X1PUA9EFA4","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is \"OK,\" not great.  Three big problems....The biggest problem, a problem that exists with this and other Samsung LCDs, is how poor the image quality is when watching any programming with lots of blacks.  You can not differentiate between any of the shades. Everything comes out to be one amorphous black blob.  If for example, you have an image of a person wearing a gray suit and walking in the night, you just see their bright face float in sea of black.  At first I thought this was a problem with my over-the-air HD signal, and not the TV itself, but when I watched DVDs with an upconvert DVD player, I noticed the exact same problem.  I adjusted the image settings until my face turned blue, called Samsung twice, zero success.  This was very, very annoying, not to mention surprising since the contrast ratio is 3000:1, far better than any other TV in the same price range.  I bet other TVs (Toshiba, Phillips, Sharp) have better contrast even though their contrast ratios are less.  Oh... Forgot to mention, I can differentiate between blacks far better on my 15 year old 20'' Mitsubishi CRT.Also, on a completely black screen (i.e. programming with a shot of the night sky, or no programming and having the TV on an input with no signal) you see white splotches on all four corners of the screen.  This other annoying feature became apparent after the first week of watching, and was not present in the first few days.  It's almost as if the TV \"warmed up\" to have this defect.  I suspect this is a variation of the clouding issue (\"mura\" defect, search for it on google, see for yourself on the AVS forums) that is seen most evidently with Sony XBRs AND Samsungs.  Keep in mind that Samsung and Sony LCDs are made on the same assembly line.When watching fast moving images, the \"ghosting\" effect is definitely seen.  This is a problem with many LCDs, so it's not just this TV.I bought this TV on bestbuy.com on Thanksgiving Day for $800.  I however have no regrets about returning it, even though I got it for an unbeatable deal.  Some people reading this may think that I am being too picky, considering how much I paid.  Let me assure you that I am NOT.  I am a medical resident, work ridiculous hours, and make about 40K a year for working 100+ hours a week.  My money is HARD earned.

{"Title":"Great television for a fantastic price","Author":"Reynoldbot","ReviewID":"RG3C3PZ681WR3","Overall":"good","Content":"I searched for a long time for a widescreen HD television.  I knew that my budget had to be under $1,000 and I wanted the largest tv for my money.  Therefore I knew LCD was the way to go and was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of quality televisions at up to 32\" for under a grand.  I narrowed down the huge list to this, a Panasonic, and the Samsung that is one step up from this one.  I originally purchased the Panasonic when its price went down but it got damaged in transit and it got sent back.  This one popped up for $820 with free shipping and I knew the getting was good so I got it.  The three tv's I was gunning for are all great televisions and I knew I would be happy no matter what I got.  In a nutshell, I am 100% satisfied with this television. I will list the pros and cons of this tv:PROS:-Built in tuner gets over the air HD picture that looks fantastic-Menus are great and easy to navigate, the remote is well made and designed-Settings are easy to change and picture settings are saved for each input-2 HDMI ports are a plus though I am not using both yet-Built-in speakers are actually very nice.  I thought about hooking up my external computer speakers but I decided it is unnecessary.-Matte black finish does not distract (the higher priced model has shiny finish that might get distracting)-Picture looks fantastic: sharp with good natural color and reasonably good contrast-Wide viewing angle-NO dead pixels!  I was very worried about this and was pleasantly surprised to find none-dvds look fantastic with a progressive scan or upconverting dvd player-Standard definition programs look fineCONS: disclaimer: many of these cons are standard for LCD tvs and do not reflect poorly on this tv specifically.-No true blacks (though I find with energy saving mode on low the blacks are pretty good)-Pixelization or ghosting during rapid movement: This is a standard problem with LCD tvs.  It is most noticable when fire or water is on the screen.  I don't watch much sports so it does not bug me.  But there is an interesting note that I have not seen on other reviews: the pixelization and ghosting only occur while watching television programs.  Pop in a dvd and it does not happen.  I don't know why but I am much happier for it.-LCDs will never look as good as CRT tv's, and the only way to compensate is with HD picture.  LCD tv's really need HD picture to look good, so you will have to add an extra $200 to your purchase with cables and high def players and so on.-I only have one or two specific criticisms of this television.  The most frustrating is the picture size option.  On the menu, you are given the option of 4:3, 16:9, zoom1 or zoom 2.  but for virtually all programming and dvds, the zoom options are disabled and I can't figure out how to get them to work.  This becomes aggravating when I stumble upon non-anamorphic dvds and tv programs broadcast in 4:3 but with a widescreen picture.  This gives the effect of a box within a box that is not very fun to watch.  I don't mind sacrificing picture quality if I don't have to feel like I have tunnel vision.-There are some light leaks in the screen.  There is a large one on the upper left and tiny ones on each of the corners.  It is completely unnoticable except for watching dark scenes of movies when I have the lights off, but it is a problem nontheless.  Other reviewers of this model notice a similar problem-This is a small thing, but I wish I could control how much the tv overscans and how the picture is centered on the screen.  I've seen the option on other widescreen tvs and it is a great tool for finicky programs.Overall, this television is a great buy and I highly recommend it.  Compared to other tv's in its price range, like the Sharp Aquos and the Phillips, this tv has superior picture and sound.  It has better menus than the Panasonic and a better overall design than the more expensive Samsung.  The problems this tv has are mostly the problems that all LCD tv's have and they are relatively minor.  I know this is can be an anxiety-inducing process, but you can rest assured that you will be happy if you buy this television.","Date":"May 8, 2007"}

{"Title":"Can't go wrong with Samsung!","Author":"J. Hansen","ReviewID":"RN9V2FLH9UZK6","Overall":"good","Content":"I'd been looking for an LCD TV for sometime. Originally I was going to pickup a 26\" but then became so aware of the minor price differences between a 26\" and a 32\" I've always known I wanted a Samsung, mostly because of my respect for the Korean people. Plus, due to all the reviews, and my experience with Samsung LCD monitors, I knew I wasn't making a mistake picking up a Samsung.From day 1, I haven't been able to complain--much. The picture quality, how the blacks appear, etc. all are wonderful. Using it with my Panasonic DVD player, Apple TV, and even Dish Network receiver has not presented any issues. I've even got an Nintendo Wii hooked up to the component input. Each and every input looks wonderful. The menu system makes sense and is easy to navigate.My only complains would be that I wish it had more HDMI inputs. It only includes 2. I ended up picking up an Xtreme Mac HDMI switcher, which works well, but, it would've been nice not to have had to buy that.The other issue is with the built-in \"surround sound\" type software sound enhancement it has. While it works, if you leave it on for everything, it just sounds odd. In the end, I've just found to leave it off..and now I'm looking for a real surround sound system.I wish it was bigger now, but really a 32\" isn't a bad size. ALl in all, if you pick one of these babies up, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I haven't been.","Date":"September 12, 2008"}

{"Title":"Samsung Continues With Quality","Author":"J. D. Ray","ReviewID":"R12ZTEEQI6UOBN","Overall":"good","Content":"Samsung is my personal favorite brand when it comes to HDTVs, though it is so far the only brand that I have owned. The picture quality is excellent and it lives up to the reviews I have read. It's supported HD resolutions are 1080i and 720p.  This does not support 1080p so you might want to keep this in mind if you decide to buy. To be honest I personally can't see a huge difference between 1080i and 1080p unless they are side-by-side, and for my purposes I didn't really need the extra oomph of 1080p.Since this tv was for my bedroom built-in tv shelf I wanted a light tv that fit the space and I wanted HD but didn't need the best of the best. I needed quality and affordability and something that could handle DirecTV HD and a progressive scan DVD player. I think this Samsung fits the bill quite nicely.","Date":"June 9, 2007"}
{"Title":"Really meant 5 Stars - Great Smaller/Cheaper HDTV!","Author":"Sandra C.","ReviewID":"R1NAICT5PR9MSD","Overall":"bad","Content":"Why 2 stars? I could not update it - at first I had trouble getting the HD setup but once I figured that out (I am not a techie) it is spectacular.This is a great entry to HDTV since it is a great price/quality and had 2 HDMI slots - a rarity!  The picture is crisp and breathtaking with HDTV.  The HD movie channels are amazing. Each HD channel for network TV seems to display their shows in various screen formats, which is annoying, but that is not the TV.I bought this at BestBuy December 9th, 2006 and choose the 324 instead of the 325 model that has the 4000:1 contrast ratio because I didn't think there was a big enough difference for the extra $200+ I would have to pay and I like the styling of the 324 better.  (At BB I had a 12% discount for Rewards Club members so it was $1029 before tax - Amazon has it at $900 something with free shipping but I didn't want to hassle with a shipping return.)I'm not a TV/techie type but when I learned how to do it, setup was easy (and yes, it does a few seconds for TV to turn on). When I bought the TV BB told me to see any channels in HD I had to have an HD cable box.  Comcast in Baltimore City had set me up with regular digital cable when I moved in but it was an HD capable box (HDMI input in back) so all I had to do was call Comcast and upgrade to HD cable ($5 extra) and then hook up with the HDMI cable and disconnect the regular coax cable.  FYI - if you sign up for HD cable at Best Buy they take $50 off your TV.  I bought the $99 Monster HDMI 4' cable there too for convenience.It's light enough for me to carry in the box so I didn't have to pay the $50 delivery or setup fee (also free on Amazon).  Everyone complains about the sound, but it seems fine to me - but I am not used to surround sound anyway.  Hope this helps! : )","Date":"December 10, 2006"}

{"Title":"What a disappointment","Author":"T. Nguyen","ReviewID":"R4OMEVRZOWXKI","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was looking for a TV for the bedroom that was similar to my Philips 42in LCD ($[...] at Costco) that has a built in ATSC tuner, which is supposedly the same as a HDTV tuner. (In addition to my regular cable channels, I get over 300 digital channels including radio stations with my 42in Philips...which is great because I love the KQED Life channel.) This Samsung model seemed to have what I was looking for. Good price, good quality, and most important an ATSC tuner. What actually made me choose the Samsung over the Philips 32PF7421D or the LG 32LC2D was that it had a PIP feature and I was able to find a price match on Amazon and got it for ~$[...] with tax. (It's on sale now for $1100)So, first, the Tuner doesn't work without an antenna. I suppose I can get an over-the-air antenna but the channels are limited in this area and KQED Life isn't one of the channels I'd be able to get [...] OR pay Comcast $[...]/month for the HD service and receiver, but that means having additional hardware to enjoy this TV. Which means, I could have been better off saving more money by getting an LCD monitor instead of an LCD TV because I can't even use the HDTV Tuner with my current configuration. (Now I'm comparing the Samsung to my 17\" wide screen Sharp LCD TV Monitor I use as my computer monitor. It's just the same. It has a PIP feature, component slots and composite slots.) And unlike the Philips, which integrates the digital channels with the analog channels for continuous surfing, you'd have to switch between surfing the analog channels then to the antenna channels with an additional button.Second, the PIP. It doesn't work with analog signals (unless the PIP is the PC or a HDMI signal.) So, that means you can't watch two different shows at the same time. Even if you had a digital signal, you wouldn't be able to watch two different digital channels either. There goes enjoying more than one sports game on HD during the sports seasons! What a disappointment. It's mainly for HDMI signals with a digital channel or for the use of the PC connection and the TV.So, either the 42\" Philips has a hidden antenna inside that's picking up all those extra channels or this Samsung is lacking. I'm returning this tomorrow and heading to Costco. Might just downgrade even further to a 32\" Sceptre, but at least I'll save $[...] and will have my HD and digital channels without any additional hardware. And if I'm disappointed with that, at least I didn't spend $[...].Would I recommend this? No. BUT, if you don't mind a PIP feature that's not completely PIP or getting an antenna to receive limited over-the-air channels, or getting the HD service with an additional box to add to your collection of DVD player, VCR, XBox, DVR, and Receiver, go for it.","Date":"March 4, 2007"}

The fellow had to walk up the equivalent of 5 flights of stairs -- he did not complain just made a joke about needing oxygen.  I can't say much about the TV it only worked for 5 hours then died.  I called the Samsung service (on sunday) they told me I would have to wait 24 - 48 hours for a service person to call me.  At exactly 48 hours to the hour I received a call from the service guy.  The soonest I could get service was 12 days later.  When the repair day came the service rep never showed.  I called and eventually received a call back to say the part wasn't in.  Gee couldn't have called me earlier so I wouldn't waste my Saturday!!.  So now I have to wait another week to see if the TV will be fixed.  I'll have owned this non functioning TV for a month by the time Samsung bothers to fix it (if they fix it).

The tv may be ok for the money now, but it sure was not worth what they paid and my mother has said several times they wish they had not bought it. The biggest issue is distortion at 16:4 of objects. They appear too wide and there is NO adjustment for this (according to the manual) which is crazy for a tv that cost this much. The other problem that won't bother too many people is  a missing feature for pc input. The manual claims this model has this feature yet the menu will not allow you to select it as a source (with or without a pc connected). It is grayed out and if you look at Samsung's website you will see this is a common complaint that is mentioned in the faq yet no mention on how to actually solve it.

If I had known that it would take close to a month to get the TV, I may not have ordered it from them. Prices are falling fast and I am not sure that it will be such a good deal by the time I get it.I will update this post as things change.Update.I talked to the shipper and now I am scheduled for delivery on 9/19, so maybe all is OK. I guess you can't go by the delivery dates quoted.Will update again when recieved.Update: 9/22/06Received TV on 9/19. No dead pixels. There is always a chance of buying something online and dealing with the return poilicy on over 27\" TV's. Fortunately I have not had an issue yet. Don't look forward with having to deal with Samsung for service. I saved about $220 plus the sales tax from buying retail. So if your really price conscious, then you should take the chance. I know that if I had a problem with dead pixels or speakers not working, then I would have just took it back to the store.As far as what I ahve seen on the TV itself...It has excellent HDTV and DVD quality. I am hook up to HD cable box and get anywhere from 720p to 1080i on HD channels..amazing picture.Do not expect analog signals to look as good as a tube TV. Digital channels are just average. So it depends or your source input.I am having trouble using HDMI input, it can't find the signal. At this point I don't know if its my cable box, the HDMI cable or the TV. From what I have seen, there isn't much difference in quality vs component input anyway. The HDMI will be useful for the DVD upconverter I will be getting.Another reason I bought this was for PC input via VGA. It displays 1366 x 768, 1024 x 768 and 800 x 600. Only the highest resouliton keeps the aspect ratio correct, so make sure your graphics card does.

{"Title":"Developed Picture Problems after 5 Months","Author":"Gregory L. Dauria \"daurigl\"","ReviewID":"R2KHNYLAMG0VAU","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is the fourth Sony television that I have owned.  Currently, we have a 57 inch XBR CRT Rear Projector in the home theater room, a 36 Trinitron direct view CRT in the living room, and most recently the 32 inch Bravia (subject of this review) in the master bedroom.  We also recently purchased a brand new Sony T9 Cybershot camera.  I have also purchased three Sony camcorders over the years.  The point of the aforementioned is that Sony has always delivered quality electronics and I have stayed with their products in return.When I first purchased the 32 inch LCD Bravia everything worked very well and it appeared to be another fine product.  After approximately 5 months of operation the television developed - for lack of better technical description - a pixel problem. A permanent dark splotchy image appeared on the left hand side of the screen.  At first the image was hardly noticeable, but then intensified to the point that it could be readily seen in all video formats.To be fair to Sony, this is the first problem that I have experience with a new product.  When I called customer support, I was told to take the TV to an authorized service center, but since there are no service centers within 30 miles of my residence, Sony offered to replace the TV with a refurbished unit.  I was not pleased that my relatively new TV was going to be replaced with such a unit, but since it carried the same warranty and Sony assured me that it would appear and work like new, I agreed to the exchange.The first indication that something may be wrong is when the crew that delivered the refurbished unit told my wife that they have to come back many times to replace the units.  True to their observations, I quickly experienced problems with the video input switching function, and was back on the phone with customer support.  I was told to reset the TV by simply disconnecting the power and restarting it.  This quick fix eliminated the problem, but now I am just waiting for it to reappear.Not happy with the performance of the refurbished unit I requested Sony to go into their \"A\" stock (new versus refurbished) to replace my original Bravia.  This request was rejected as I was told that the model has been discontinued - keep this in mind if you are thinking about purchasing this television.I recently walked through Wal-Mart and looked at the new LCD's on display.  Many less expensive sets had as good, if not better, picture then my Bravia.  I am sure that Sony has also improved their LCD televisions, and will be lowering prices to hold their market share against the increasing competition.  They are a good electronics company with superb engineering capabilities, but I think they have considerable room for improvement when addressing a defective product and an unhappy customer.","Date":"August 29, 2006"}

Amazon had the best price for the TV and matching stand.  Shortly after receiving it, it began blacking out.  The tv would stay powered on but the picture would go out randomly for about a minute or 2. I thought maybe my Tivo was dieing since I use that as my primary device.  Within a few weeks the HD DVR from Comcast arrived as well as our IP TV.  The blackouts continued with these units as well. At this point I figure it must be the tv and call Amazon.Not our problem says Amazon you're past the 4 week time frame, call Samsung.  Samsung had a service agent out within a week. Unfortunately he didn't fix it.  There were problems with the service company and it took another 2 weeks for them to get out to try and fix it again.  Nope not fixed after 2 tries.  On both occassion I had to waste my whole day waiting on the repairman.  I was told I will be contacted at 11am on the day of appointment and told when he will be coming.  Both times I was told 3pm (I had requested first stop)My first call to Samsung was on March 21st.  I am still waiting to get this resolved.  I have spent over 5 hours in Customer Service calls with CS and Executive CS.  I keep being told that they will see about getting someone out to fix it or that they will replace the TV.  I never get responses to my follow up emails or phone calls inquiring about when.(I have been polite with an annoyed/frustrated tone at times but never cursed or screamed at anyone - maybe i should start?)I can only say while this TV gets rave reviews, heaven help you if there is a problem with it.  Because Amazon and Samsung sure won't!  They got your money and apparently that is all they care about.  :(  I for one will never buy from either again.","Date":"May 9, 2007"}

Not actually a pixel of course because DLP is based on tiny mirrors and the image is projected onto the screen from about 12-inches behind the screen. The dot eventually turned black. No big deal, as it was the size of a pinhead admidst a 56-inch screen.However, over the course of the next two weeks more dots appeared, as if the TV contracted chickenpox. There are now over 100 of these dots, some white and flashing and some dead and black, and they are continuing to develop, virtually rendering the television unusable at this point.Of course, after the 1 year expiration there is no warranty back-up from Samsung.I called them and they said a technition would call me to set up an inspection, but this was over a week ago now and I have not received a call. Also, I know it would cost $50-100 just for an inspection, and then to repair the TV I assume will cost me hundreds of dollars. Not worth it.Sad that a $1200 TV has only a 3-yr lifespan.No more DLP for me, and will probably now be conned into purchasing extended warrenties on future TVs.Although disappointed I will make the most out of my new TV-shaped gigantic paperweight.","Date":"January 4, 2011"}

Two weeks ago the picture became all distorted. Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it.

They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.Fianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again.Now I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.

The picture was great and for the first couple of years all was well. During that time and based on the excellent picture and no problems occuring we purchase a second 61DLP for our downstairs game room. Not long after the second purchase the lamp in the first set went out. I called support and was told the lamp was not covered in the warranty, so we spent $179.00 and installed it ourselves. All went well for another 2 plus years then the set went out again. This time a technician came to the house and informed us that the \"engine\" needed to be replaced. Luckily we had bought the extended 5 year warranty (for $450) and we were still in the warranty period (by 2 months). He replaced the engine with a rebuilt one, can you believe it after spending $450 on a warrantywe got a rebuilt part. But it worked and we were happy again. Only one year later the set went out again and after buying another lamp (which we could not return) we were told by the Samsung technician it wasn't the lamp and the TV for all prctical purposes was dead. My upset is with the fact I spent $4,971.91 for the latest technological set and only got 6 years use out of it, a cost of over $800 per year. But we had the second set and moved it into our living room about 6 months ago. It has seen little use in the game room and had very few hours on it. I thought we would be good for another few years.

Purchased the samsung dlp tv in 2008 and within two and a half years the tv began to have white dots that completely covered the tv screen and shortly after that  black dots began to pop up all over the screen as well. I found that it was a samsung manufactures mistake. After calling samsung and getting the run around, they said that my tv was not one they would fix for free.Sad that a billion dollar company would not take care of their customers. They transfered me to there repair department only to find that they do not repair dlp tv's anymore!! Yes you read right, THEY DONT REPAIR TV'S THAT THEY SOLD ME A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER!I called a local tv repair service to see what could be done. It came down to me having to pay $500.00 to get it fixed! Wow, I payed over $2,000 for a tv that only worked for less than four years.Samsung DLP tv's are horrible.

{"Title":"Very Disappointed with Samsung HL-S6187W","Author":"Lou Verrone \"Lou Dog\"","ReviewID":"R2DSKEWLSPOE8E","Overall":"bad","Content":"Do not buy this set!  And if you do, don't buy without an extended warranty!After months of research and reading hundreds of reviews searching for the best DLP TV back in September, 2006, it was almost no contest that Samsung was getting rave reviews for its picture quality.  Most of my tech head and audio/video buff type friends where all sold on Samsung.  After years of being a life-long owner of Sony's and Toshiba's, I decided to make the move and join the Samsung movement.  1.5 years later, I must say that I regret making the switch and will most likely not purchase another Samsung again.  I will not argue the picture quality is brilliant and a joy to view.  I am not at all displeased with the picture quality.  What I am not happy about is replacing a lamp and ballast for $500 less than 18 months after I purchased it for $2,200.As a lighting professional, I understand that all things like ballasts and lamps can and will fail.  But in my world, ballasts carry a 3 to 5 year warranty and lamps are guaranteed for 50% of their rated life and take a lot more abuse than my TV set.  Considering I have owned only 5 or 6 TV's in 23 years and all, except one are still working and only 1 has ever required repair after 8 years!  I simply don't appreciate paying 25% of the TV's value within 18 months of purchase for needless repairs.  Samsung offered no help other than answering the phone promptly, letting me know I was out of warranty and gave me the telephone number to the local service shop.  As far as I am concerned,  a $2,000 TV should work for a minimum of 3 to 5 years without a penny in repairs.  But the reality is, they don't...so in my case, a bad ballast failed and also caused a lamp failure.  Ballast's should not go bad within 2 years.  I will gladly pay for a new lamp, but Samsung should have furnished a new ballast and they should last at least 5-10 years.Anyway, if you are considering buying a Samsung, beware that there are many service issues that are showing up after the warranty expires that will cost you big bucks, such as noisy and bad color wheels and in my case, ballast and lamps.  My Toshiba display is just as nice, and is still working glitch free. My Sony failed after 8 years, but was so outdated, I was actually praying for it to break so I could buy the Samsung.  My only regret now is not buying another Sony or Toshiba, or minimally, an extended warranty.","Date":"April 18, 2008"}

{"Title":"Stay Away From Samsung","Author":"Amazon Fan \"AF\"","ReviewID":"RBW8P2HXA0O9N","Overall":"bad","Content":"I always thought very highly of Samsung as producer of quality electronics and just spent $2000.00 on this TV.However, today's encounter with Samsung customer support changed my opinion of the company and I would like to explain why.One day after receiving the TV, the screen tilted. I called Samsung and was told a Tech would be sent out this week. I explained to Samsung on the phone how the TV was tilted from the base. Samsung said the Tech would try to bring the part, but he may need to come back a second time if he doesn't have the part.The Samsung Tech arrived and after removing the back cover, saw the inside plastic assembly was cracked, said the issue was \"physical damage\" and to contact the seller and left.He said Samsung only covered the electronics, not the internal plastic housing holding the TV upright???  He would NOT give me anything in writing with this determination.I called Samsung again. I spoke to \"Mike #42\" who said I could not have another Tech examine and repair the TV. When I said, so now I just spent $2000 and have a broken TV, he replied, \"Yup, that's pretty much the story\".It is unbelieveable that Samsung would sell a $2000.00 TV which breaks after a day of use and then has techs who try to blame \"shipping\" and also state they don't fix \"the plastic parts\".Clearly there is some sort of design defect with the TV or it is not packaged properly for shipping if the TV's plastic breaks INSIDE after one day of use. Phone representative Mike #42 said to me \"they break if you sneeze on them\" when telling me I'm stuck with a broken TV.I am shocked how Samsung will not stand by their products and honor its warranty. Once the $2000.00 is in Samsung's hands, the customer is treated by Samsung customer service like garbage.","Date":"December 29, 2006"}

It worked for the first day, then wouldn't turn on the next day.  After repeated calls (read *several* a day)to both Samsung and the retailer, a technician was sent and confirmed that the projection box was broken, a $1000+ repair.  I told the retailer that I wanted a replacement set delivered to my house or the old set picked up and my card credited.  Going into the third week, I've made over 30 documented calls to these two parties and still have a broken TV and no firm plans as to when I'll get a pickup and credit or a new set delivered.  And I've never had my call returned even *once* from Samsung.  Thank goodness this happened within 30 days of purchase or I'd be forced to deal with only Samsung.  The local retailer's performance is unacceptable, but at least they call me back.Beautiful set when it worked, and I'm willing to accept that the set I got was a rare broken one.  But the lack of support I've received from Samsung has convinced me not to buy another one.  Buyer beware.","Date":"January 6, 2007"}

{"Title":"Three defective sets!!","Author":"Amazon rocks","ReviewID":"R2GXGGYQ8BQ7Y6","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this set just before Christmas last year.  I got the set on Dec. 28th.  The picture was distorted at the top of the screen in the center.  An area about 12\" wide by about 3\" down.  During movies, you could almost not even see the distortion, but when watching a sporting event with the graphics going across the top of the screen it was very distracting.  I went around and around with Samsung Customer support.  I called three times over about 2 weeks and everytime I called the rep said that he would put it in and that he did not know why it did get put in right the last time.  While I was waiting on the third rep to come through for me and have a local service person call me, a new TV showed up at my door.  I had inquired with Amazon about my options for returning the TV for a new one the same time that I started calling Samsung (Because I would obviously rather have a new set).  I thought that I was waiting on someone from Amazon to call me back about the matter.  But whatever, Amazon is great, I was happy.  HOWEVER, The second set delivered had a obvious power supply problem.  It made a hi pitch noise with the set \"OFF\".  And every other day, the set would not turn on and when it did, the remote would not work.  If you tried to change the channel(or volume, or press any button) on the TV itself when the remote wasnt working, the TV would shut off.  Here we go again. I called Samsung again to find out were I stood with my previous call.  When I got the customer service rep on the phone, he told me that the call had STILL not been put in.  He stated that \"people in here just don't care.\"  I guess he was just trying to relate with me, but this infuriated me.  I made him get a supervisor.  That's where my opinion of Samsung changed.  I got to talk to Stephanie (supervisor).  I told here the situation and she was very professional.  She called the next day to let me know which shop local to me had the service call.  She was great.  I called Omege Electronics, the company that services my area.  They told me that they would not order any parts before they came out to look at the TV.  When I told them that the problem was intermittant, he told me that he would have to bring the set to there shop for a week or so.  Thats when I called Amazon.  They said that I had the option of a refund or wait till March and they would swap it out again.  I chose to have the TV replaced again.  Finally, I got the TV, and, can you believe it, the picture has the same problem as the first TV, only not as bad.  Three strikes, Im out.  But Im sure its just bad luck that I got three bad set in a row.  Good luck if you buy this set, I had none.","Date":"March 6, 2007"}

Samsung cannot find a service center that is willing to work on this TV because I live in a rural area.  The Samsung service center is telling me that I must wait an additional 7-10 business days for them to try to find someone to fix my TV, then whatever additional time the repairman needs to get to my house, plus the wait for parts, and a return trip.

{"Title":"Beautiful Picture - Poor Quality Control","Author":"Richard B. Adams","ReviewID":"R3LIMIA6B7X57V","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought my first Samsung HLS 5087W on March 6, 2007 from one of the well know \"big box\" Stores.  I chose this model because its picture was far superior to any of the other models in its price range.  I took a chance, however, and bought returned \"open box\" TV, saving a few hundred bucks in the process.  The salesman assured me that the set had been gone over thoroughly before it was put back on sale.When the Television was delivered the picture was stunning, and I was very pleased with my purchase.  After a few days, however, the picture arbitrarily began switching from 4:3 to 16:9 aspect ratio.  This would happen every half hour to 45 minutes.  Not a big deal but annoying to say the least.  Instead of returning the set under the store's 30 day return policy, I had them send a service technician out to see what could be done.  He scratched his head and said he'd have to do a little research, and would get back to me in a day or so.  About a week later, with no further contact with the technician, the set developed a new problem - it would cut off every once in a while.  At that point, I had had enough of this dog and sent it back to the store.  However, I wasn't ready to give up on Samsung and their bright and beautiful DLP picture.  I paid the extra bucks and had a brand new, right out of the sealed box HLS 5087W delivered.The new TV had been in my house for less than two hours when it lost sound.  I checked all connections and determined that it was a problem in the TV.  An hour or so later I turned the set back on and everything was fine.  I watched it for about an hour thinking all was well when the sound failed again.  I returned to the store that night and told them my sad tale.  The salesperson told me that they had, indeed, had several of these Samsung models returned for various problems.  He said they seemed to be having major quality control problems.  I told him to come get the TV.I took a chance the first time on an open box model and got burned.  I chalked it up to the old adage that \"you get what you pay for.\"  The second time around I took no chances and paid full price for a brand new version of the TV, but still no luck.  Not being a complete fool, my third was not a Samsung.  It's a shame that a TV with such a beautiful picture has to be done in by poor quality control.","Date":"March 31, 2007"}

However it now has developed the white dots of death syndrome.  The DLP chip inside the tv is faulty and Samsung will not stand behind their product.  They state that the two year device is suffering \"normal wear and tear\".  So if you purchase this device or possibly any other Samsung device you can expect a faulty component to be effected by \"normal wear and tear\".In this case to get it repaired is at a minimum of $450.00.  And you can expect to spend another $450 in possibly two years to replace this \"normal wear and tear\" component again.I would suggest passing on Samsung products.","Date":"August 30, 2013"}

I wrote Samsung and was told my TV was out of warranty and it would cost $400 to fix.  I told them there are people all over the internet with this problem and that it was bordering on a class action lawsuit because Samsung knew about the defect and still shipped the TV's.They changed their mind immediately and fixed my TV for free, but it will just be another 4 years before the defect shows up again.

Last fall, this 50 inch DLP from Samsung sounded like the way to go.  Good reviews, affordable, new color wheel, 1080p (future proof), no risk of burn in, etc.Went ahead and bought it in May.  I was disappointed.  SDTV simply looks god awful on this thing.  Sharpness, color, you name it, it looks way out of whack.  Grainy, dull, ugly.  And let's face it, there's still a lot of SDTV to be watched out there.  Also, rainbowing not totally fixed like product description claimed.  Worst of all, quality control issues at Samsung.  My set (bought at a brick and mortar) had these watermark like stains running along the top and bottom of the screen.  Read a lot about this on other sites, as well as faulty light engines burning out after just several months.Ended up returning and going w/ the new 50 inch plasma from Panasonic.  That set rocks!  SDTV looks far better, not so boxy of a set, only a little higher price tag.  The trade off is 1080p.  The Panny doesn't have it.  But before all you out there start thinking of 1080p as the second coming, I suggest you do a little research into noticeable difference in 1080p, screen size and viewing distance.  Unless you're an avid gamer (I'm not) or like to sit 5 feet from your 50 inch screen, it might not be so special after all.As far at the Samsung again, HDTV looked very good, but not as good as the plasma.

After watching this particular TV for several months, I was pleased to see the price drop to what seemed an excellent deal.I made the purchase innocently enough, though was struck that it may have taken up to three weeks before the product was available. Still, at that price I was willing to wait.After about a week, I received notice that my package was en route and would be here in a few days. On the day that it was to arrive however, I was informed that the package couldn't be transferred from shipper to shipper. Apparently the carrier who would deliver the TV to my door wouldn't accept it due to the fact that there was the sound of broken glass in the box.I contacted Amazon to tell them that I would be willing to wait for a replacement, but I would like to have it expedited. I was told that wouldn't be a problem, and I was informed that my request would have to go to another department. I was told that I would be contacted by the end of the day.Four days later, after not having heard back, I called Amazon. I was informed that the only shipping choice I had available was the specialty shipper, and that there was no possibility of expediting the packaging. It would arrive in 5 to 10 business days.At this point the wait for the television was getting too long, so I asked to cancel the order. I was sent an e-mail two days later stating that all of the e-mails that I had been sending were missed, and they asked if I would like to proceed or cancel. It was at this point when I called in and made it quite clear that I wanted this nightmarish business finished and that they should cancel the order immediately.It's now more than three and a half weeks since my card was charged and several angry conversations later -- I don't have a TV and I don't have a refund. The order details online state that the unit was successfully delivered to a city 70 miles away from me, and there is no sign that I've initiated a return. My credit card retains the original charge, which will start accruing interest soon, but Amazon has assured me that I will be refunded the full amount sometime within the next four (4) weeks.","Date":"September 30, 2006"}

By \"DEFINITION\" the term \"High Definition\" (HDTV) refers to 1,080 scan lines of resolution.480p (progressive scanning) is the EXACT same resolution used in a Standard Television's 480i (interlaced scanning).  The difference being a full screen refresh rate of 1/60th of a second used in 480p images opposed to 1/30th of a second used in 480i images.  A negligible difference may be noted when viewing very fast action segments of a program or sporting event.If you want High Definition Television, look for a model capable of displaying 1080i or even better yet the latest available 1080p models.Retired Senior Technical Specialist (AT&T;)","Date":"August 30, 2006"}

There is nothing you can do to make a non-HD signal look anything like HDTV; garbage in, garbage out. And no, turning your sharpness to 100 doesn't count as HDTV. A friend had his new HDTV hooked up wrong, using s-video from his HDTV reciever - was very excited at how great his new tv looked. I pointed out, that, no offense, that isn't HDTV. He was confused - we got some component cables, hooked it up right, and his jaw was to the floor. There is NO COMPARISON.*If you can't see the difference, see an eye doctor - you may be nearsighted. Before eye-surgery, tv was fuzzy without glasses on.*If you had to settle on ED over HD, telling yourself its \"just as good as HDTV\" is about as reasonable buying a Prius and saying its as fast as any sports car on the road; you bought it to Save Money. Be happy with your purchase but don't embrace ignorance on technology. And realize, people aren't coming by your house for football because they'd rather watch it in HDTV, its not because you do bad BBQ.","Date":"November 13, 2006"}

The problem was intermittent at first but now it is almost constant.  The black scenes are blotchy green and other colors are over saturated to the point where the picture becomes a blob of pixels.  The TV screen is so hot that watching it in my bedroom during the summertime was not an option, so it really has been lightly used  (I have two other bigger TVs.)  The response to the remote control is so slow that you often wonder if you hit the right button.  Even if I had purchased an extended warranty, I'd still have to cart the thing more than 60 miles to an authorized Hitachi repair center although I live less than 10 miles from a nice size metropolitan area.  If I had to say anything nice, I'd say that when it works, the picture is great...but it stopped working after less than 500 hours of actual use...and that's a bit more important.","Date":"March 17, 2008"}
{"Title":"Nice tv, BAD service/warranty","Author":"Frustated","ReviewID":"R1E50VEN76U83F","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this Toshiba DLP television recently. Before 1 1/2 months old, it just stopped working. Called Toshiba, and they directed me to 3 service centers. First one never answered the phone. Second one said they would call back within an hour... I called back a couple hours later and they said they were swamped and would call me back. Never heard from them again. Third one said Toshiba did not authorize them for home service. So now I'm stuck with a $1500 paperweight, until they will authorize the retailer I bought it from to service it.So after talking with the tech at the retailer, he was sure it was the lamp. It took me 2 hours to get toshiba to send me a lamp replacement(they kept on flat out refusing until they called the tech themselves), which ended up not even fixing it.Now, it could be weeks before I get a working television(guaranteed another week at the very earliest), it's already been a week. I am just in shock that I spend that kind of money on something, it breaks this soon, and they could care less if or how long I am without a television. They will not budge on trying to compromise to make me even somewhat satisfied. It's just 'sorry, company policy' over and over and over.I have always owned toshiba tv's, but never had a problem with one. Their level of customer service just plain stinks. I truely can't believe it, I've dealt with microsoft for xbox 360 problems, and I thought that was bad. I've dealt with Nintendo, there's a company that knows customer service. This is just plain frustration and nothing else. With a tv that new, they should be letting me take it back to the retailer for a new set. If it wasn't for a 30% restocking fee the tv would be returned now.Bottom line, if you have any problems with a toshiba product be prepared to be without it for a long time and get no satisfaction at all. And now I will worry that my tv is a 'lemon' and even after I get through this mess it will just happen again in a couple months to go through again??","Date":"January 9, 2007"}

Simons","ReviewID":"R2UKX9GVANVJUS","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought one of these exactly 2 months ago and it got a splendid picture and functioned perfectly...till about an hour ago. I was watching it and heard a loud pop and that was it. I looked in the trouble shooting section of my manual and confirmed the lamp was indeed burned out.So I went online so see about getting a bulb from one of the 2 sites listed in the manual only to find the first site had been sold to a domain selling site, and the second site had no bulbs whatsoever. After searching the web I found out these lamps sell for $600, if you can accually find one. Sorry, but I'm not foolish enough to pay $600 every 2 months (Or less than 2 months according the the other review) to keep it running. Nor do I want to hear the \"Sorry, but I can't help you because of company policy\" line or wait weeks for the service department to do thier job.I am returning it tomorrow. Lucky for me I was doing a rent-to-own contract on this new TV so I only lost my first payment. So I would recommend people not buy this type of TV. Since all DLP TVs work with these lamps, I would think of them as a brilliant $600 light bulb that only lasts about as long as your average light bulb with a $1500 recepticle that will sit dark in the corner waiting for you to feed it another lamp.","Date":"January 31, 2007"}

Each bulb lasts about 2,000 hours and not the 8,000 hours that is promised.  My repairman said to be cautious of using generic $100 bulbs from Ebay, because they will ruin the ballast and cause a more expensive repair.  The next replacement will be out of my pocket, so I will probably shell out close to $200 for an authentic Toshiba bulb and replace myself (very easy to do).

{"Title":"Unacceptable reliability","Author":"A. T. Williams","ReviewID":"RCDI58LHFRV4Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought our TV mid 2007 and was initially pleased with the apparent value.  The picture quality was great, though the speakers were underpowered when watching digital television signals.  Analog channels had acceptable volume.My frustration began in late 2009.  The TV began making a buzzing or grinding sound intermitently; some days were worse than others.  Shortly thereafter, the picture went out and the TV was inoperable.  Several online reviews described the same noise and diagnosed it as the light engine, not the bulb, color wheel, or fan.  Light engines were available online for approximately $400, but I was neither confident in the diagnosis nor the installation.I called a repair man to confirm the problem before proceeding.  He determined that the color wheel was no longer properly aligned, which was the likely source of the noise.  He was surprised that the color wheel caused the picture to go bad, and discovered that the bulb was burnt out.On most DLP sets, the total cost of these 2 repairs would be approximately $350.  Unfortunately, Toshiba is one of the few DLP manufacturers that does not sell individual parts like the color wheel, choosing instead to sell the light engine assembly.  Non-OEM parts were available online as mentioned earlier, but this was only one of the 2 problems.  To replace the bulb and light engine, I was looking at $600 which can buy a completely new TV.Online reviews accurately described the symptoms and problem, and estimated the cost of repair well.  However, had I pursued the repair myself I would have missed the 2nd unrelated problem caused by the burnt out bulb.  In this case, calling a qualified repair technician paid off.Toshiba's decision to sell spare parts at the modular level makes the most likely repairs major investments.  According to the repair man, Toshiba is the exception and not the rule for DLP TV's.  Since I had paid the repair man for the visit, I interviewed him about him long-term TV reliability.  He had a couple of interesting points:1) DLP TV's are on the lower end of repair costs (excluding Toshiba due to their modular assembly).  LCD's and plasma's are also modular and are expensive to repair.2) He warned of the lowest tier of TV's due to the frequency of the parent company filing bankrupcy.  He suggested that you stick to Philips, Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, etc.","Date":"March 2, 2010"}

There will not be a second one which is available for $250. The TV is just under 2 yrs old. We thought this TV would be a less expensive second unit when we bought it at the same time as our LCD flat screen. This Toshiba has now cost a lot more.","Date":"January 19, 2009"}

I didn't purchase the PSP, so thats the way it goes, but for HP to make the consumer have to replace their TV in a year is unacceptable business practice.FYI...Sony, Panasonic, et al provide replacement parts much more readily.Do yourself a favor and take into account how easy it will be to get service on your TV if you need it.Having said all of that, I'm particularly disappointed because I thought this unit was excellent...while it actually worked.","Date":"January 31, 2008"}

No picture.  The price may look cheap, but if you have to replace your TV every two years, it's really quite expensive.  Also, because HP is not a common brand, you can't program universal remotes from cable/satelitte providers to work with it.  So, you will always need two remotes.  The speakers/sound of the TV are wildly inadequate.  Also, this TV has serious burn problems.  The parts of the picture on the sides of the screen were signficantly brighter after moderate use.  This was due to viewing some non-widescreen broadcasts, which apparently dimmed the more-used pixels significantly.  I WISH I HAD BOUGHT A SONY/SHARP/SAMSUNG/PIONEER.","Date":"March 30, 2010"}

Do a google search for problems related to this model and you will find numerous hits. For me personally, this TV self-destructed after only a couple of years.  It was on, there was a loud pop, and now it no longer works. I disected it myself to see if it wasn't maybe something simple, like a blown fuse or capacitor, but a fter searching around it seems this is a very common problem.  Replacement parts are somewhat hard to find...but the cost for those parts is around $300-$500.  Having someone actually service it will run you $600-$900, but there are numerous reports of people being unable or unwilling to service this particular TV.Before it died, we experiended many of the problems with pixel flare/MAL discharge issue and the image shuttering when showing images with a lot of white or bright colors.  Again, extremely common problem although there are reports of being able to adjust voltage settings on the PSU and resolve some of them.  If you're comfortable poking around in the guts of your TV, it might not be an issue for you.There's no reason to buy this TV.  It has a history of problems and there are any number of TVs that are as good, if not better, better brands, better features, for less money.","Date":"June 19, 2010"}

We went to Circuit City and decided on the LG 37\"...it was the least expensive and seemed to have the best picture.Dad didn't want to pay for an expensive CC extended warranty because we figured if something were to go wrong with the set, it would happen within a year.We got the set home and installed...the picture was so good with just the coaxial cable connection that Dad canceled the appointment I had made with Comcast to set him up with a hi-def digital box.Well, everything went fine until July 2007...two months after the LG warranty expired, the TV suddenly stopped responding to the remotes...not just the LG remote, but another universal remote that he had programmed as well. He eliminated all of the obvious causes...dead batteries, blocked sensors,light interference etc. He had the TV taken into be repaired. The tech, after undoing almost 100 screws to get to the circuit board, said he found and repaired a badly soldered wire (which surprised me since I figured that these circuit boards are all solid)..that was the only thing he could figure was wrong with it. The TV/remotes worked fine for about 3 weeks and now the same thing has happened again. So my 89 yr old father has to get up and go over to the TV every time he wants to adjust the volume of change channels. I call it the LG Senior Citizen Workout.Of course the set is beyond warranty, so neither LG nor CC has any legal responsibility...except that people should know that there are serious manufacturing flaws in these products that are not easy repairable...even if the consumer is willing to pay for the repair.LFNYC","Date":"September 16, 2007"}

But I have been hearing really good things about Samsung's line of TV and the contrast ratio of 3000:1 on this TV made me pull the trigger.I am just very disappointed because the complaint about the \"Not supported mode\" is very true.  It appears that this TV doesn't like to support progressive scan from a progressive scan DVD player.  It does fine with HDTV signals which are currently at 720p or 1080i but half of my use of this TV is to watch DVDs on a progressive scan dvd player.  Yes, I can still watch DVDs by disabling the progressive mode of the DVD and watching it in 480i.  But that's like going backwards 5 years.And the thing about Xbox 360 makes perfect sense.  If you are playing games on it, you are most likely in HD mode so it works, but if you are trying to watch a DVD, then you are in progressive scan mode (480p) so it doesn't work.  I am just deeply disappointed in Samsung that they failed me like this on my very first Samsung purchase.  This is a basic mode that they overlooked.  Who knows what might go wrong next?  This TV is going back to the store.The TV itself is very nice actually.  Nice sleek look, great picture from HD signals, but it still left a really bad taste in my mouth that Samsung couldn't get one of the most basic things right.An update.  If I could rate Samsung's Tech support, I would give it 0 stars.  I called them up on this issue and was hung up on twice while in the process of going to higher level of support (which I am beginning to guess is their way of hanging up on people).","Date":"December 29, 2006"}

On Feb 13, took it to the repair shop for warranty repair.  Was told after 5 days, that the part that it needed was no longer available.  And that they would send me a  replacement TV.  The TV was a 2005 model, manufactured in 3/2006.  Was asked to fax my receipt.  Samsung gets my receipt and says that it is to blurred to read.  Have spent hours on hold trying to get to their customer support about the TV.  I feel that since I have called several times to try to get some answers that Samsung is recognizing my name or case number  and just ignoring my being on hold.  Yesterday was on hold for an hour and a half with music playing in my ear.  Monday, I will fax them an 8X10 copy of my receipt that I hope will not be too blurred to read.  So things are still up in the air.  Was getting the TV for a bedroom, and had plans to buy a 40 inch soon.  No way, will I buy it from a Samsung dealer.  With all this calling and waiting, my 30 day return policy has passed and I stuck having to make payments on it. I had the TV for about 10 days, and even though it was my first LCD type TV , had to learn about it.  I could not turn it on or off, except with the remote.  Neither did the controls on the side work.  So I can not give any opinion about picture quality or anything..........just want them to send my replacement TV.  So beware of needing any repair while in warranty.  And if your TV is not working as it should, take it back and do it quickly, and forget about having any warranty work done.

But then came the worst part, wherein the whole TV will get switched off on it own and a red light on the front would continue to blink. Even resetting the TV wouldn't solve this problem. I bought a refurbished model and Philips gives you only 90 days of warranty of refurbished products. So by the time I saw these issues, the 90 days were over and Philips asked me to gets the TV repaired on my own.

I bought this item from a local retailer in Dallas because it seemed to have the best picture for the size and price.  I also tried to find reviews online before I made the purchase and was only able to find the customer reviews here on Amazon.  It was delivered today and I spent most of the day trying to adjust the picture quality. The great picture I saw in the store was impossible to duplicate at home.I do not have an HD signal to feed into it yet as I was waiting to upgrade my DishNetwork DVR until after the TV was delivered.  However, the standard def picture is awful.  Whatever settings I tried, the picture was dull and hazy.  Everything about the picture was lifeless compared to my old 42\" EDTV Samsung... except for the color green.  The green will burn your retinas!  Grass and trees looked like they were painted neon green. Adjusting the hue to a more red shade failed to counteract the over-powering green and only caused skin colors to look horrribly sunburned.I also failed to get a sharp picture.  I wouldn't say that the picture was blurry. But adjusting the contrast and brightness settings either returned a picture that looked like it had a transparent white film over everything or a picture that was to shadowy and overly black.  Finding a happy-medium was impossible.The original factory setting are completely unsatisfactory.  Someone in the Hitachi labs is colorblind and has cataracts.  I'm returning the TV right after the holiday rush is over and getting a 50\" Panasonic, Samsung, etc. instead.  I will never buy another Hitachi product again as long as I live.

Unfortunately, if you have one, yours will likely quit in the same way mine did after 2.5 years: You'll lose picture, but still have sound. My local repairman told me that, even if he could get the parts (they are simply unavailable from any supplier), the cost would be greater than the cost of a new name-brand TV. (He based that statement on his knowledge of the prices of similar parts for other brands he services.) Also, based on troubleshooting info I found online, I took it apart to see if there might be any bad capacitors, but they all looked good (that is, not bulging or leaking like electrolytics do when they fail). I treated my TV really well, never overheated it, and always powered it through a surge suppressor, and it still died. Serves me right for picking a TV based on its picture quality.

I haven't had many of the large failing issues others seem to have but that doesn't mean it has been smooth sailing. First off the tv has this rolling distortion line that messes with dvds and my xbox. Also during dvd playback the black level fluctuates and is inconsistent. Lastly, and most annoyingly, my tv will not auto search any channels,it can find the channel if you manually input it into the remote but forget channel surfing.

I repeated the steps noted and it kept happening. I unplugged the unit and then put it back, and again after a very few minutes it went black but the sound remains.

When I pop in a DVD, the sound drops. I have to turn it high, and sometimes it's still not enough.I am disappointed that it died just after, actually within, three years. Very disappointed.It started by just flickering between all 5 inputs on its own, as if a phantom took hold of my remote and kept hitting the input button. Then one day, it just didn't turn on, and that's where I am now.I called Polaroid, and with no extended warranty, they offered to give me a refurbished unit for $175, and I'd have to ship my old unit back on my dime. Dissatisfied. A TV repair place knows exactly what the problem is, and quote at least $20 to fix.I was very happy with it until it died. I am careful with electronic devices. All items that came with the unit are perfectly in tact, including the box, and packaging.I hope that they no longer sell this model. Very disappointed. I won't be buying another Polaroid TV again.From reading some of the reviews, 3 years seems to be the longest run for this model, which isn't altogether bad, but I feel that it should have gone for at least another 1.5 years without irreparably dying.","Date":"January 22, 2010"}

Due to an extensive remodeling project, the TV was just plugged in and the receiver does not work!  Direct TV will take zero responsibility for this!  Their excuse is that the TV is made by HUMAX and that the receiver isn't made by them either.  My response to them is that their name shoudn't be plastered across the box then!  HUMAX also takes zero responsibility (it has a one year warranty - after one year, you can forget getting anything from them) as this unit is no longer made nor sold in retail stores!  Thank goodness, I was not a cheapskate and bought an extended 4 year warranty - the best $99.00 I ever spent!  This was an expensive unit and to not have the TV work because the receiver doesn't work is pretty frustrating (you CAN attach a different receiver to it and it should work, but that pretty much defeats the purpose and makes for an expensive 20\" LCD TV!)  Installing an integrated receiver obviously wasn't such a hot idea.  I'm not yet sure how Best Buy will handle this, but it is under warranty, so they will need to deal with it somehow.  I guess I would rather buy a different flat screen TV and simply attach a Direct TV receiver to it, so that if one goes down, they don't both go down.  I would think twice before you buy this unit.  It is a nice looking, compact unit, but it's not worth it if something goes wrong. It seems that satelite receivers have a tendency to \"die\" way more often than they should.  My brother is currently on his third one after 4 years!","Date":"August 25, 2007"}

The \"service\" number in the Akai manual connects you with seems not to be tech-support at all, but an answering service  in Ohio. (The corporate HQ is in California!) The \"associate\" who answers the phone tells you that, \"...they will pass your problem along.\" They also tell you not to expect any action for over a month because they have to do \"research\" on finding someone in your area to fix your TV. A month or more to look up \"TV repair\" in the phone book. Right!When you ask for a name of somebody who is empowered to make decisions at the company, you get the dodge, \"We're just an answering service.\" No phone numbers. No last names. They evidently got off the dime when, on the third phone call, I threatened legal action, after a month of being ignored. But I still can't talk to anyone at Akai to find out the problem or who's in charge. Zero, zero, zero in the feedback dept. Customer service at Akai borders on criminal negligence. Nobody is home.Six weeks after my first call, a local repair person called me and showed up a week later. Akai really must have done that \"research\", because he reflects their corporate culture--he doesn't return my phone calls. I suspect they just picked the cheapest service and now are dragging their feet on providing the part. But I don't know. He hasn't gotten back to me for over a week. But at least with him I can personally go to his physical location to find out what's going on.If you think you can solve this problem by getting an independent warranty, think again.

The rest of it is abolutely 0 stars.First off the set broke in early February. It started shutting itself down due to a false lamp temperature problem immediately after booting up. Ok that happens, things break. This is where the nightmare begins.2 weeks after I report it to Mitsubishi to get it serviced, an authorized agent shows up without any tools or parts, not a good sign. Then I am told by said service tech. that I needed a new light engine and lamp and that I would have to fax them a copy of my proof of purchase so they could order the parts. About a week later after not hearing anything I called the servicer who told me the parts should have been in. I called Mits. to find out what the deal was and was told the parts were backordered. I waited 5 days to see when the parts would be in and was told they did not get a part number from the servicer. I asked if they had no part number how could they tell me they were backordered.Good ?. So a month and a half of hassle later, the service center comes out again...and hour and a half late mind you, again no tools, no parts and looks at the TV again and tells me it needs a light engine and a lamp..no kidding. That was Friday the 6th of April, 2 months after it broke. So I called Mits today , Monday the 9th of April and have spoken to 3 more unknowledgable customer-non-service reps from Bangledesh or wherever, and was told I needed to fax a copy of my proof of purchase just before she rattled off where I bought it(Electronics Expo) when I bought it and the model number. I told them I already did all this a month and a half ago, you know what I need, please get my warrantied TV fixed, its been 2 months. I have now sat on hold as I type for over an hour. So like I said , great TV when it works, but if it breaks, hold on to your hat because you'll be in for a long frustrating ride.Update , Aug 22 2007.  Just a note that I upgraded to 3 stars because as I said now that it works again, it is an amazing picture. I did take me 2 months to get it fixed, alot of frustration  and ribbing from the boys at work, but we made it through. If it breaks stay on them, I think it was a common failure in the light engine, hopefully Mits. worked it out. It is great while it works.","Date":"April 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"ONLY HORRIBLE THINGS WILL FOLLOW-DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!","Author":"D. E. Johnston \"Jaded User\"","ReviewID":"R2MAYC865Z3XRB","Overall":"bad","Content":"I own a WD-52628 model.  The 52 inch sister to this very model.  It actually uses a similar lamp to the 65 inch model.  This review applies to ALL MITSUBISHI REAR PROJECTION HD TVs.After 3 years of ownership, the tv has had numerous problems.  Each time the tv is \"out\" for repairs, it has been in a repair shop for at least 3 months.  Maintenance has only taken it out of action for 2-3 weeks waiting for the lamps.  I view maintenance and repair as two seperate items.The first problem that occurred was the blinking red light and no picture.  This was due to a burned out light engine, per the repair store.  If the warranty had not covered it in the first 180 days, it would have been an $1800 dollar repair, plus labor.The second issue is with the replacement and dispossal of the $230 lamps that contain mercury.  You can't just toss these things into the trash.  In the 3 years of ownership, I've gone through four lamps, each costing at least $230, at a cost of roughly a thousand dollars. In 3 situations I had to go through the internet to purchase new lamps.  Shipping at first from Mitsubishi took 3 weeks.This last problem that I am in the middle of now is the dreaded blinking green light on the front.  Per several investigative websites(Consumer Affairs, etc.), blinking green light is caused by two different types of situations.  The first situation is that one of the two cpu's on the device is not in synchronization with the other cpu.  Ergo no fix, just replace the item.  The other situation is with the 4 capacitors on the mainboard, either the 4 caps will need to be replaced by new capacitors, and/or the mainboard will need to be replaced.Minimum cost of repair for the last problem has been estimated at least at $1000 plus labor.  The problem is that any solution starts with recognizing a design flaw during manufacturing.  The tv sets were assembled with inadequate parts, per some investigatory websites.  The parts themselves do not function adequately in the environment created by the rest of the parts inside the tv.

A few months ago I noticed a little white dot on the screen for someone with a little case of OCD it drives you nuts, BUT...

{"Title":"Our Mitsubishi Nightmare","Author":"edmlfc \"Lesson Learned\"","ReviewID":"RZJRQWLKJ0KG2","Overall":"bad","Content":"It all started when we purchased this TV. We went to the store and yes it looked great! Wonderful picture! Little did we know the store has a \"\"limited\"\" amount of channels. Mostly HD. We get the TV home, the picture is horrible. Of course we call the cable company, they come out and we upgrade to digital cable. One week later we upgrade again to HD. Finally a picture that looks good but I only watch that one channel once a week. All of the other channels still look horrible. We call the store where we bought it. Now it seems we need monster cables. We purchase those for over $200 dollars. Picture still no good. We call the cable company again they come back out change the cables in the house. Still not a good picture. We call the store, they say it's our reception we should get satellite. We call cable company they come back out, change the box outside the house. Still a bad picture. We cancel the cable. We call satelite. They come out hook up our dish. Once again HD channels are great but don't watch but one, once a week. We call the store, they come out. NOW.... it's the satellite getting a bad reception, not the TV. Even though we are getting a signal of 97%. We call the satelite company they come back out adjust the satelite. I hold them hostage for some answers!!! By now it's been almost 3 months dealing with the same problem \" a bad picture\"!! They tell me I would need the satelite to recieve the HD channels, a pair of rabbit ears to recieve my local channels and an outside antenna to recieve other analog channels \"that I do watch\" to get a good decent picture. The store's tech came out the day after the satellite company came out and told me the same thing. so I did some research through BestBuy found out he's right. On the Best Buy website I quote: \"NO MATTER HOW NICE A TV YOU BUY, THERE ISN'T MUCH YOU CAN DO TO MAKE REGULAR TV, INCLUDING DIGITAL CABLE OR SATELLITE, LOOK BETTER. My only question is: WHY DIDN'T THE SALES PERSON TELL US THIS???? The other TV we were looking at was smaller but more $$$$. Now we are stuck with a Tv we cannot watch for more than 1 1/2 -2 hours.  The picture is so BLURRY you really can't stand it for much longer than that. A good example: During Super Bowl Sunday: we were trying to watch the game, you could not tell if the score was an 8,3 or 9. It just all blurred together. I do not recommend buying this TV unless you never watch REGULAR TV. This Tv is only good for DVD's or HD channels.

The lamp life was too short.  When I ordered a $199.95 replacement and paid extra for 2 day shipping, the lamp didn't come for a week.

When I explained that this still didn't explain why 2 day shipping took a week, they explained that address verification took some time and that I received it 2 days after they finally shipped it.The bottom line is: 1) the lamp life is short; 2) the replacement cost is expensive; 3) you will be without your tv for a week even when you pay for faster shipping; and 4) Toshiba customer service is poor.","Date":"June 14, 2006"}

The TV indicated it needed a new lamp, so I replaced it. For five minutes I had a picture that was crisp and perfect. Then it developed a red tinted bar across the top of the screen. Researching of the web determined it was a manufacturer flaw and is very expensive to fix. I called Sony, which admitted the flaw, admitted it was extending the warranty on some projection LCDs, but this particular model was not included. So I asked for Sony to honor its no cost electronics take back program and schedule a pick up to recycle it. I was given a bogus web site and two bogus phone numbers. Sony in fact does not have such a program, unless you want to drive 90 miles to the nearest recycling depot to drop it off.I will never purchase another Sony product again.","Date":"December 2, 2012"}

{"Title":"High Maintenance Costs","Author":"Donavon","ReviewID":"R2214A0YOB25W6","Overall":"bad","Content":"The main thing you want to consider before buying this TV is the replacement of the lamp.  I bought mine in Nov 2006, replaced the bulb in Oct 2008 $200, replaced it again 8 months later in June 2009 $150, again 7 months later in Jan 2010 $150 and today 10 months later it has gone out again which will be another $150.  And to top it off, this lamp is on back order so Ill have to hunt around for 3rd party places.$650 in bulb replacement costs over 4 years.  Most of us plan to keep our TV's for 10-15 years especially since we all paid so much for them.  First bulb has the 2 year life, after that 6-10 months life on replacements.  Pay that every year for 10 years and your looking at $1500.  Hidden costs if you ask me.In addition my friend bought the same TV except it was the 50inch the same day I bought mine.  He has replaced his bulbs in the same timeframes as I.Don't get me wrong, the TV quality was fantastic so long as your lamp is bright.  If the bulb wasn't so short lived and a high cost, I would give this 5 Star's however I must give it 1 star because its unrealistic to have bulbs go out this much.  You basically pay for the cost of the TV and through the life that you keep this TV you will eventually spend the money on bulb replacements that eventually will add up to the cost of another TV.  So if you keep this for 10 years, you will be paying for two TV's but only have one TV.I will not buy another bulb again.  I will be looking at buying another TV that's not Sony.","Date":"November 24, 2010"}

{"Title":"Nice TV for a while...","Author":"MB 007","ReviewID":"RRVA8C1GJKP3I","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this television in early 2006 when I moved into my new home.  I needed to get rid of my tube HDTV due to space constraints, and I needed a panel to mount above the fire place.I spent a very large amount of time doing homework on the specifications, and narrowed my search based on price and my requirements (1080p, LCD, etc), and arrived at either the Sony XBR or the Samsung LNS4695d.  After hitting the pavement, and seeting the set in the proper viewing places (avoide Best Buy and other big box stores, as they split the signal too many times, and have varying signals between different sets depending on where they sit on the daisy chain) and decided the Samsung offered virtually the same picture quality and specifications as the Sony, and for less money.The set treated me great for 3 years, with only one exception.  During very fast motion, such as a football game (American) where the ball was thrown past the crowd, or a car race, I would experience macro-blocking, and the set's 60hz simply could not keep up with very fast moving HD broadcasts (via cable).  There were other issues related to this, but suffice it to say, the TV processed too slow to keep up, and artifacts and other symptoms showed that.  I also had minor ghosting in some circumstances, but I find that is visible to the experienced eye even on the Sony sets and other CFL backlit models.After 3.5 years, just out of warranty, the set recently started showing horizontal white and colored lines.  flashing and intermittant at first, over 8 weeks, they slowly became more static, and eventually made the TV unwatchable.  The condition appeared across all sources, and after much troubleshooting and time on the phone with Samsung, the TV was determined by them as \"at the end of its useful life.\"  For the price I paid, I found this conclusion utterly unaccetpable.  After further research, I've determined the board that processes the horizontal information had failed.  The part is $500 from Samsung and a handful of other providors, which equates to what I could purchase the same television for now on ebay.  There are essentially zero Samsung service centers, and no in-home service options.  I would have been forced to ship the television out of state for analysis and service, with no guarantee it could be repaird.  I decided not to bother attempting to repair it, as purchasing another working set would have been the same or cheaper than other options.I've since upgraded to another brand, with more current features, and have been very pleased.While the failed hardware isn't a widespread issue (though it does exist if you look closely online), i simply couldn't reccomend this product to anyone any longer, primarily because of Samsung's determination that a $x,xxx television set should only last 3 years.  The other issues were annoying, but I was able to live with them, however the set I use now is flawless, and cheaper, and more advanced.  My advice, continue to avoid paying for the Sony brand, and Samsung is not the solution.  With some homework, you can do much much better for the money.","Date":"October 23, 2009"}

I went into the store and got a full credit. Unfortunately I had only found that 1080p displays have INCREASED in price and not decreased! That's a first!The Sharp Aquos easily looked the worst out of the three I checked out. At the time the Sony 46\" Bravia was four hundred dollars more than the Samsung, so I said forget it! People say you pay more just for the \"Sony\" logo on the TV. I don't agree. I do think you get more than the competition.I went with this display and hooked it up. I put in a movie and was shocked to see what I found. Certain scenes would go black and some pixelated \"shadow\" or images would still be on the screen. Kind of like \"leftovers\" of the previous image. It looked so horrible. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. It's hard to describe this really.The only way to fix this problem was by using \"Game Mode\" to speed up the display. Nice! Not quite, because this setting does NOT allow you to use the preset settings for the TV (such as Normal, Movie)! It ONLY allows you to use \"Custom\" settings.I configured this TV to my liking and used Digital Video Essentials for calibration. I have experience with calibrating my TVs just perfectly. I've found that the DNIe setting on this TV just makes everything look worse! It's almost as if it just cranks up the sharpness setting to max.I connected up my Oppo Digital Upscaling DVD player and played dozens of movies with this DVD player and a Toshiba HD-DVD player. Certain parts of movies have extremely annoying greenish speckles or tint. This is mostly displayed in very dark scenes. It's so easy to spot this and there is absolutely no setting to fix this. Perhaps a special service menu can fix this. I shouldn't have to do that!I also tried several new cables and various DVD players. I also tested a DVD player through the Component Inputs and was shocked at how terrible the picture was. It was as if input was bad or something. Sure, 1080p can make lower quality video look bad, but not THAT bad. This was unacceptable picture quality for such a high priced TV!I was also watching \"ICE AGE\". On the white ice you can see very faint lines in the image. This occurs in very bright scenes throughtout movies. It's almost not noticable in dark scenes though or from more than 5 feet away. This alone though is so bad that it's enough to make me want to return it.Again, i've wasted hours upon hours to try to see what caused the greenish tint. Even standard television stations sometimes have this. It mostly appears in shadows and especially on the left hand side of the screen.Now today while watching \"The Green Mile\" I saw ghosting! Yes, even with \"Game Mode\" on! I couldn't believe it!The TV is well designed and nice to look at. Other than the green tint to  parts of the movie and the white lines, HD-DVD picture quality is incredible! I was really impressed with the picture quality. Sames goes for very well made standard DVDs such as \"The Green Mile\".I think the remote is good. It's well laid out and i've had no problems with it. The menu system is a bit slow though.I had high expectations for this. I did hours and hours of research and could find no bad things about this display at all! Perhaps I just got a bad one, who knows. I went back to the store and we are doing an exchange for the Sony 46\" Bravia 1080p display. Hopefully I will have better luck with that!It hurts to give this nice thing a 2/5 score. It honestly would be unfair to give it a higher score for such great HD-DVD picture quality with all of it's problems. There's just so many of them. For the price you pay for this television it needs to be perfect! Some could say no TV is perfect, but that's not true!Now I think I know why the Sony Bravia is a few hundred dollars more! I should have trusted my gut when in the store instead of saving a little money.12-14-2006 UPDATE:I'm still using this TV. I went to do an exchange 14 days after purchasing this. It was that bad. I have to wait until the 21st for my new Television. It's nice that people love this TV and you got a good one. I wish I did. I don't know if mine is just defective or what.I now have absolutely TERRIBLE ghosting. It's so bad it makes my head hurt. There is no way this could have a 8ms refresh rate! I watch maybe a dozen movies a week and it's just so bad. At some points It was making me so mad that I just wanted to turn off the movie! I do have \"Game Mode\" on and have tried every setting. I've experienced this with The Green Mile, Mad Max: Beyong Thunderdome, Art School Confidential and half a dozen other movies. I've tried several DVD players as well. Strangely this doesn't occur quite as much with Blu-Ray and HD-DVD movies. The faint white lines are also annoying as well. You can see them from a mile away.12-21-2006 UPDATE:I finally had them come pick up my TV and replace it with a Sony. The Sony KDL-46XB2 has been out of stock at my local store for over a month, but I finally received it. I love the Sony and it's great so far. Nearly everything is good in my book, but i've only used it for a day. I'm going to evaluate it for 2 weeks or more and then post a review of it. The only problem is that some units have a \"cloud\" defect, so it might be a risk. Luckily mine is ok. I could have \"gotten by\" with Samsung, but it had way too many issues. The Sony was only two hundred more and was well worth it.  The \"guts\" are not the same. Only the panel from what I've read.","Date":"December 1, 2006"}

Get a life.\"  Just another company with no commitment to customer service.  Their attitude is we got your two grand and you can wait.","Date":"February 15, 2007"}
{"Title":"Stay away from Samsung","Author":"Amazon Customer \"erik\"","ReviewID":"R2FQ3IZKIOFX3R","Overall":"bad","Content":"I recently bought this TV and within 4 days needed to get the main board replaced. Since then, the picture has messed up 3 additional times for no reason, and the only way i fix it is by unplugging every cable or letting it power down for at least an hour or over night.  This is not the way a tv should be it shouldnt be this much work.","Date":"December 20, 2006"}

{"Title":"Average TV","Author":"MaxShiraz","ReviewID":"RVE54EGI437M3","Overall":"bad","Content":"TV picture and sound are just average. Mine lasted less than a year before it broke, hence the 2 stars. I'd rather spend more and get a better TV next time.","Date":"July 3, 2007"}
