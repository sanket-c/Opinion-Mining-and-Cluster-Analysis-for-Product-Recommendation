TV arrived, worked great.  And then, well, boom.  The first 24 hours it got very flaky - every 30 or 45 minutes, the communication between the remote & the TV dies, and the power button gets mapped to 'volume down'.  It's toned down in terms of frequency and I have a repair person coming, but still, bleh.However, when it *is* working, it is amazing for the price I paid (875ish)edit:  Turned out there was a loose connection.  Took the repair folks (Sascoa) just a few minutes to figure it out, and its been perfect ever since.","Date":"September 12, 2007"}

The ordering process, shipping and delivery was flawless!  My TV arrived well before the estimated delivery date given and WHAT A PICTURE!!  I went with the 720p for a couple of reasons.  1. Price - You simply cannot beat the quality this set delivers for the price point.  2. Everything is being broadcast at 720p or 1080i.  The only thing actually delivering a full 1080p is Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.  I haven't decided what type of player I'm getting until the format war is over.  I loved the picture so much with HD broadcasts, that I had to run out and get an up-convert DVD player because I couldn't stand watching my movies from my standard player.  I cannot say enough good things about this TV and will be purchasing a lot more products from Amazon!!","Date":"September 4, 2007"}
{"Title":"Awesome TV, a perfect first HDTV","Author":"B. H. \"Hatchman\"","ReviewID":"R13GZHVNTGL3DM","Overall":"good","Content":"After hearing about this great TV from a Co-worker, I had to get one myself.  The current price at $879 here at Amazon with free shipping makes this the best TV at the this price on the market.  Sure, it's only a 720p, but it looks great to me.  This is my first HDTV, and I am very satisified.  I had to swap out my cable box for an HD box at my local cable company, but the box swap didn't cost a thing, and I got every movie channel free for a day, so it was worth it.I tried the regular coaxial cable and the S video connection, but the picture still looked the same.  I found a set of component cables that came with my new cable box and BAM!, there was the awesome picture I was expecting.  I've got an HDMI cable on the way, so the picture might get even better.  Just don't pay the $80 and up the CC/BB wants for Monster cables, Amazon is selling an HDMI cable for $1.20 at this time.The only bad thing is, this awesome TV is better than my current Sony DVD player.  Compared to my new HDTV channels, watching a DVD now looks crappy, for lack of a better word.  So... I've ordered an Oppo upconverting DVD player, that upconverts to 1080i and 720p, from Amazon, so I'm looking forward to seeing my old DVD's in new life.The factory preset \"dynamic\" and \"store\" video settings are pretty bad.  Make sure you change the operation mode from \"Store\" to \"Home\", otherwise every time you turn the TV on and off, you'll have to reset all of your video settings, since they will not be saved.  Once you go to home, all the setting will be save for each source.  After a few hours of tweaking, I finally got the picture looking awesome!  I've heard this set takes some tweaking, and they were right.  But once you know what needs adjusting, it's a piece of cake.So GOODS:Great value, best TV at this price on the marketGreat pictureSharp looking, I love the slim frame and black piano look, very clean.Very slim for a projection TV, and pretty light too!  Weighs about half as much as my old Sony 32\" tubeOthers:A little bit of white light can be seen shining out from behind on the left side (looking at the set).  Can really only be seen if the room is completely dark and could be concealed with a little ingenuity.Sound is not all the great, but I already have a Harmon Kardon/Infinity subs, etc, so I have never used any of my TV's speakers anyway.  You will want some kind of sound system to get the full effect.Only 720p, but too be honest, this thing looks great and such a huge jump in quality from my old \"tube\", I don't even care.  And I haven't hooked it up with an HDMI cable so the picture and sound quality may get even better.The last other, vertically the picture looks a little different.  This TV needs to be viewed straight on.  In other words, it looks just a little different if you're laying on the couch or sitting straight up, almost like there is a little line or shadowing.  If you put the TV at eye level, it looks great, but if you're laying on the floor (for some reason) or standing up, the top or bottom of the screen make a little darker.  This is very minor, and really only noticable when your standing up or sitting down.  Once I get settled if I'm laying on the couch, I don't notice it at all, so this is no big deal.  But if someone mounts this real high on a shelf so the screen is perfectly vertical, they will have some shadow banding problems.  Once again, put it at the eye level you plan on watching it at, and it's perfect.Hope this helps someone, someday.  I love this TV!","Date":"August 23, 2007"}

I ordered this TV on Sunday afternoon 8/12, got an email on Monday 8/13 that my TV had shipped and a call on Tuesday 8/14 from Eagle saying they had my TV ready to deliver that day!! I live in the DFW, Texas area and apparently Amazon has a warehouse in near-by Irving.  So, it was a fast, smooth transaction.  I had read some bad things about Eagle, so I was a bit worried about how the delivery would go.  But, they were SO great!  The delivery guys called when they left their warehouse to let me know they were on their way.  When they got here, they unpacked the TV from the box and set it up for me. They wouldn't actually plug anything in, I had to do that. But, no big deal.  I plugged it in, turned it on - it worked (and looks great by the way), so I signed for the TV and they left - it was all so quick I couldn't even believe it! PLUS I saved $450 over what I would have paid at a local retailer for the EXACT same TV. I paid 899.98 with free shipping for a 50\" HDTV! I couldn't be happier! Thanks Amazon and Eagle Delivery!  So far the TV looks great - I will leave a follow-up once I have had it a while...","Date":"August 15, 2007"}

Viewing angle horizontally is good, vertically not as good but really not much of an issue.  Since it's projection it has a bit of warm up time but it's nothing bad.The number of hookups are excellent, i've got an xbox 360 connected via VGA, a ps2, and my Tivo.  Dvd's on the xbox look crisp (the 360 will upscale over vga).  I also just purchased the HD-DVD addon and have been pleased with the picture quality.I'd say if you find a good price on amazon it's worth it to buy it and have it delivered, I saved a good 500 bucks on this tv vs retail and have been very happy :)","Date":"August 9, 2007"}

{"Title":"My set is perfect, fortunately.","Author":"Angelgirl","ReviewID":"RAFTN8T00RK0A","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had a similar 50\" Samsung DLP HDTV set for two years. It cost me $3,000 and was a good price at that time.  I bought an extended warrantee because I wanted to take no chances. I haven't needed the warrantee or any kind of service. It was a little challenging learning about the set's adjustments, but I expected, and got, the best picture I ever imagined! The only picture problems I have had were the fault of the cable company, e.g., low signal strength or poor connections within the cable box, and not the T.V.  I would get another one of these in a second, but I would put it through it's paces immediately, and if it weren't perfect, I would return it! And it's lightweight... I got a stand for it at Walmart for $69 that works fine.  I'd say buy one, but make sure your particular set is working right and make sure you can return it if it isn't!","Date":"July 25, 2007"}

{"Title":"I know I ignore some bad reviews when I'm looking - hopefully you won't","Author":"Mark Twain65468","ReviewID":"R2EMPN66HIM0LK","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought a similar Samsung set in January of this year and had a problem with it within the first month and a half (unfortunately I had bought it before moving to a new house and didn't set it up until we were settled in, my mistake and at that point it couldn't be returned).  The picture is \"grainy\" (for lack of a better term, it's actually grainy/sparkly/generally terrible looking) on all sources.  Oh well, although it can't be returned I can use Samsung's warranty and have the problem fixed, I'm not concerned at this point.  Samsung set up an appointment with a local TV repair place and they came out and looked at the set.  The tech didn't know what the problem was and decided that the screen needed to be replaced (he insisted it was on backward and that was what was causing the poor picture).  Weeks later the tech returned with a new screen but scratched the new one while trying to install.  ALthough I would need a new screen (he also scratched the original trying to put it back in the set) we noticed that the problem was still present with the new screen in place and the tech decided it was a problem with the light engine.  Again I wait for weeks while a new screen is ordered and finally he returns with the screen - but no new light engine.  The screen is replaced, nothing is better and the tech leaves.  Throughout the entire process I had been contacting Samsung and telling them I didn't think that the service person knew how to fix the problem and this was just more proof.  I called Samsung yet again, they called the service center (who said that it was fixed, even though it definitely was not and the light engine was never mentioned again), and customer support (supposedly executive customer support) said they would have to find a new service center.  Again I wait weeks for a call back, finally I have to call Samsung to find out the status.  I was asked to send in digital pictures of the problem so I did, but with the caveat that the resolution of my camera can probably not pick up the problem that I am seeing.Anyway, last week I was called by Samsung and they have finally decided that my set is \"in spec\".  They made this decision based on a few lower quality digital pictures and refuse to service my set for this problem.  I am stuck at this point with a TV that does not have a sharp picture and there is nothing I can do about it other than spend more money on a new set.Before you buy any Samsung product I would suggest thinking long and hard.  They do make some quality products but if you have a problem with it I would not expect their warranty service to help you in any way whatsoever.","Date":"May 31, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great LCD TV","Author":"Thoreau Bartman","ReviewID":"RVEV2WVD5ZUSQ","Overall":"good","Content":"When my old 36 inch CRT finally went bust I was ready to upgrade to a flat panel. And after a ton of research I settled on this one. And I think I made a great choice. From what I have read, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference actually checking out the TVs in the stores because their settings are way off etc etc. This TV was picked as the second best LCD (behind the much more expensive sony) by the CNET editors, and from everything I was able to track down this new TV looked like a winner.So I just bought online from amazon without actually seeing it in person. Which turned out great! The delivery company (eagle) was very fast and nice (although I did call them and they did NOT have my number-very glad I called). They came in and helped me set it up, and even helped me move my old enormous one out of the way.The TV is beautiful! HD programming is simply amazing. Just amazing. I have never seen something this nice on TV before. DVDs look just ok compared to it. Like on all HD tvs, standard defintion programming and DVDs don't look quite as good as on my old CRT, but it is very close. The connectivity is great, (even better than the devices I am connecting it to actually).The glossy black finish is pretty cool-although it does get dusty pretty fast. And the surround sound is darn good as well. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.The only problem I have found so far is that occasionally the sound will go out for some reason. If I change input sources or turn the TV off and then on again it comes back, but still-it is a concern.UPDATE!The sound problem was bugging me, and I eventually called samsung customer service. After a few fruitless merry go rounds I was finally directed to something called \"Tier 2\" customer service. Apparently this sound drop out problemis a known issue with this TV, and they have a very easy firmware update fix. They are overnighting me a thumbdrive with the updated firmware and said that it would entirely fix the sound problem. I think it is pretty cool that they are going so far as to send me an actual thumbdrive with the firmware on it because I don't have one already.I am very happy with this fix, but will report back if there are any other problems.  I am still absolutely loving the TV, despite this sound problem.","Date":"May 8, 2007"}
{"Title":"One of the best TVs for the money right now...","Author":"P. Werdel \"prw\"","ReviewID":"RSTZQWMADEWQQ","Overall":"good","Content":"After months of research about brand, screen size, screen type, and resolution, I settled on this 720p LCD from Samsung. Don't believe the hype about 1080p sets at this size: it is absolutely the case that at this size (40 inch) the difference between the look of 720p and 1080p signals are negligible at the viewing distance most people will sit from their sets (6-10ft). Do yourself a favor and save some cash, unless you absolutely must have the newest tech toy. Me? I'd rather put the $500 toward a pair of speakers that look and sound the part next to this marvelous LCD.Colors are rich, sharp, and with no noticeable ghosting or pixelation. I've heard some folks complain about the hidden speakers sounding muddled, or uninspiring. With a bit of EQ tuning I think they sound fantastic for on-board speakers.Ordered from Amazon on a Monday evening with free shipping (and at $500 less than retail in BB or Circuit City!). The set was at my door by Wednesday afternoon. Unbelievable!No complaints. This is a gorgeous set at a fantastic price.","Date":"May 23, 2007"}
{"Title":"One major flaw mars an otherwise excellent TV","Author":"B. Toy","ReviewID":"RND50NEEPFVVF","Overall":"good","Content":"I've spent the last 2 months shopping TVs both online and in-store. I ended up picking this unit as my bedroom TV and am supremely happy with its performance.The pros:Plasma was out because my bedroom is bright and I needed the anti-glare surface of an LCD. LCDs are also lighter so I could handle moving it around myself. It feels lighter than the ~40 pounds it's supposed to weigh.Lots of inputs including 3 (count 'em) HDMI connections. I have an HD Tivo and upconverting DVD player hooked up and still have a spare HDMI port. It's also got 2 sets of component video if you have HD equipment from a couple years ago. There are more inputs that I won't bother listing here since you can get the list elsewhere.Visual quality is stunning with HD signals. 720p and 1080i look amazing though I'd give the nod to 720p for slightly better image quality. High quality standard def signals still look very good. Poor quality signals look worse than you'd expect from a CRT based TV. I sit ~8 feet from the TV (I like the immersion) and barely notice the compression artifacts. I'd rate the noise performance at a very good 8 on a 10 scale. I wouldn't pay the premium for 1080p unless the screen size was encroaching on 60\".The included stand swivels. I used to have my 36\" Sony Wega Trinitron on a turntable so the included swivel stand is a really nice addition.The high gloss, \"piano black\" finish isn't as obnoxious as I thought it might be. It also doesn't pick up fingerprints the way I expected.The cons:Switching inputs is painfully slow. Especially when switching to the HDMI connections. The HDMI and component inputs are \"on\" as long as a cable is plugged in, even if the device is off. So when I want to pass through my DVD player (which is off) to get to my HD Tivo (which is always on). I have to wait for it to scan for a signal, realize it's not detected, and then tell me so on screen before I can move on to the next HDMI input. You can select from the main setup menu, but it takes about as much time as it does to cycle through. For this many inputs, I wish they used the Toshiba method and put up an input menu whenever you hit the source button. Direct input selection buttons on the remote would have been ideal.The stand does have a tendency to lean a couple degrees forward. I'm not concerned, but it's not as sturdy feeling as I'd have liked.It produces as much heat as my 36\" Sony CRT did.The picture-in-picture was an afterthought. It doesn't have enough options to be useful. Since I have an HD Tivo and the cable set-top-box, I'd like to be able to set one for HDMI and one for component video. Unfortunately, it only shows me the built-in tuner for the in-set window. My parents have a 15 year-old Mitsubishi that let you select any combination of inputs for PIP.I've had the sound drop-out issue twice over the last week. I'm waiting on Samsung to send me the updated firmware.Bottom line:If it weren't for the incredibly frustrating input selection, I'd consider giving it 5 stars. But this peformance issue is enough to withhold that last star.","Date":"August 15, 2007"}

It's really amazing how much glare comes off of Plasma's when you look at them in stores (not always an issue for everyone though depending on their setup, of course).- I ruled 1080p out because after comparing side-by-side from real viewing distances (7 to 10 feet) I could not tell the difference. 1080p is just not something I need at this time.- I had thought about going for a 46\", because when looking at a 46 vs. 40 in a store, it made the 40 seem so small.  I am soooo happy I ended up getting the 40\". It fits perfect in my room (max sitting depth from TV is about 10').  Anything bigger would have looked too big in my opinion.  When my wife came home to see the tV for the first time she actually thought I ended up getting the 46\" because of how big it looked. =)I have had the set for just over a month and I still am in awe when I watch stuff on it.  HD programs are sweet and even the Standard Def. programs look pretty good. It really all depends on your source for how good they look.This set has plenty of easy to access options to adjust colors, dynamic mode, sound, etc...Even when the set is off, it looks amazing. The design is very nice and would make a nice, classy addition to any room.  A week after I bought the TV I saw a magazine ad for this series of Sammsung's that focused purely on the beautiful design and looks of the TV.

First off, it came in a HUGE box, so be prepared.  The TV was packaged nicely by the Office Depot branch I purchased it from.  The TV itself is beautiful, sleek, shiny black exterior, and the plastic see through bottom piece is a nice touch.  Upon setting out television up to standard cable the picture of channels obviously varied because I don't have HD Cable.  But my boyfriend discovered a couple HD channels which looked AMAZING.  We found Discovery Channel HD and the picture was beautiful, it shows the real capabilities of this television.  My boyfriend's an avid XBOX 360 player and we tried out Call of Duty 3, Gears of War, Madden, Forza, and Rainbow Six and they all looked great.  The detailing of the characters and spacing is incredible.  My only complaint is getting used to such a huge TV.  Overall a great LCD HDTV, and a great value!","Date":"April 20, 2007"}

Based on my research thus far, I'll give it a 5 star rating if/when Samsung takes care of their audio issues and I buy the unit instead of the Sony or Aquos/Sharp. Am seriously considering to buy 2 actually...BUT I've read on the Amazon LNT3253H forum having 21 RECENT comments on audio problems with that model!!! I see now that there is an audio prob on one comment here with the 40\" and reference made in the 50\" product as well. I'm going to cut and paste a comment from the 3253 forum that seems to point to a problem with this generation of Samsung LCD HD units. This comment out of all of them seems to point to THE FIX by the Samsung service techs needing to swap out the main electronics board that includes the sound card...read on: In reply to an earlier post on May 23, 2007 7:26 PM PDT Andrew Chabak says:I had the same problem: as directed by Samsung I replaced the Comcast cable box, and then even replaced the HDMI cable. The problem remained. I contacted Samsung again, and they sent a Samsung repairman. He then replaced the main board which contains the sound card. Now it works correctly...no sound dropout! Also, I was told by the repairman, that this is a newer version of the board, and this problem has been fixed by him in the past. Call Samsung and ask for someone to come by and fix it. They have some bad boards in these. - Further comment by me: I see in the 3253 forum that there is reference made to other firmware or software updates/fixes being developed...yet those customers that have applied them still have the problem but at a lesser level of occurrence. I'll be calling Samsung tomorrow to see if they want my business .... and will judge how serious they are about tackling the issue that exists. Remembering that there is only a 30day return policy and 1yr warranty. I don't want a temporary bandaid that doesn't hit the actual root cause in longer term use after the warranty has run out. Let's keep them HONEST!!!UPDATE - 6/10/07: Ok I've received an email from Samsung. I've replied back asking what they would do if the main board/audio card fails from audio issues after the 1yr warranty expires. Who pays? Read on:Samsung says: We are aware of the issue with the television and audio problems.  We have a fix that can be applied on with a thumb drive provided if needed.  In some cases if the drive is not successful we do swap out components.  Hope this helps.If there is anything else you would like assistance with, please feel free to write us any time.

And I don't think I should have to buy an extended warranty for what appears to be a factory design flaw to begin with????? Mark Vreeland 801-787-4040","Date":"June 6, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great looking -- On or Off","Author":"Cali","ReviewID":"RDG3XRMJT570S","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this unit from Amazon, not one of the stores on Amazon. Amazon sells great products at great prices.This unit is beautiful, definitely exceeded my expectations.The delivery was on time. No damage.The TV is beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful on the market today. Simple, clean, elegant lines. Very impressive. I was leaning towards a similar product made by Sony. But then the look of the unit, the price, and the better reviews it got won me over. It is piano black (except the screen, of course, which is matte black). I was concerned about reflection but it was not a problem while watching it for several weeks now. Shiny black looks sharp especially when it has smooth, elegantly lines. Straight or hard edges, which this unit does not have, can make shiny black look cheap.Hooked the TV up. Wow. The picture is, of course, beautiful! Not much tuning was needed. Looked great right out of the box. The pictures are so realistic that I kept saying \"wow\" for at least the first 10 hours of watching. Great color, contrast, brightness, etc. Things just jump at you when you watch a HDTV channel. Samsung certainly has made a great product and Amazon did a good job selling it.By the way, my old TV was 27\" Sony. I had concerns too about LCD's contrast ratio and/or brightness compared to the top of line tube/CRT TV. No need to worry. I found this unit to be as good as or far better than the tube/CRT TV in every regard.For those of you who need advice on size and resolution, here are some thoughts. I debated it for a while but I am happy with my decision on this unit. I sit about 12 feet from my TV. I found out that, for a 40 inch TV at this distance, 720p is all you need even though you have 20/20 eye sight, which I do. 1080p would be a waste unless you want to watch it closer than 10-12 feet or you want a bigger screen. You can pretty much calculate what you need using your actual numbers and 720p, 40\", and 10-12 feet as baseline. I hope this can be helpful to you.If you do buy this TV, I suggest you try turn on and off the \"edge enhancement\" feature. When it is on, the picture jumps at you more. However, facial features and hair details look more realistic when it is off.Another thing interesting to mention, which is not the TV's fault, is the HDTV channels. 720p channels look fantastic. 1080i is good with static pictures only. If anything moves, including even the head motion during a person's not-too-energetic speech, motion blur occurs, very annoying. Effectively the motion blur comes and goes all the time no matter what program you are watching, not just sports which I don't watch very offen. This appears worse than it does on the old TV perhaps because the static picture is so good with the new TV. I do not understand why the networks even think about offering HDTV that is interlaced (the i in 1080i means interlaced.) Unfortunately NBC, CBS and public television HDTV channels all use 1080i. ABC and two other local channels in the San Francisco Bay Area use 720p, which was a sensible decision.Good luck finding your perfect TV.","Date":"August 4, 2007"}
{"Title":"Great TV!!","Author":"J. Pina","ReviewID":"R1LLTAOPCVDLHT","Overall":"good","Content":"Did my research for two-three months prior to committing to this model. Have owned three other Samsung televisions and have been very happy with each. When needing service, Samsung provides excellent support.I was looking for a 32 to 40 inch LCD for my office. I was originally looking at a 1080p model but when I saw the extremely positive reviews for this model, I had to go to the store to see if it could stand up to the more expensive units. I was impressed. This TV is only 720p but its picture is just as good as any other. From a distance of 6-8 feet, its very difficult to tell them apart.The TV has a very slick design and its speakers are hidden on the underside of the front panel. Sound is decent quality but video is amazing. This has so many picture settings to adjust right from the main menu. The only bad thing is that there are two known issues that numerous people are reporting. One is an audio drop-out when using HDMI, the other is what they call \"tearing\" when watching HD content. A horizontal line will appear about 2/3 down the screen for a few seconds. These issues have been resolved via updated firmware, so if you experience this, call Samsung and they'll email you the update.Shipping via Amazon was impressive. Ordered Sunday night, it shipped Tuesday and scheduled delivery via Eagle Freight on Friday. They delivered White Glove service as promised.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase, its craftsmanship and Samsung,","Date":"September 7, 2007"}

{"Title":"Bonkers!","Author":"J. Nelson","ReviewID":"R2JS77ZCWR6I7N","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is BONKERS! I'm not a technically sound person when it comes to the latest in electronics, but I'll try to make this reasonably understandable.Picture: The picture on this set is GREAT. The cable installer hooked up the HD box and I immediately requested to see Discovery Channel in HD. He flipped the channel over to a program about exotic snakes, the snake being profiled was the Black Mamba and seriously, the beauty of this creature was brought out to the fullest by the picture of this television. You could see the texture on each scale as is slithered by, it was awesome. Standard television programs take a dip for sure in quality and watchability, this I was told would happen with any set, and after seeing Discovery HD I can see why. I bought a $60 upconverting DVD player along with the television and I must say the picture looks fantastic, as adverstised I would say (much better than standard, not quite HD).Sound: I've read online that the audio quality is not that great on this and other Samsung sets, I have yet to notice this drawback. When I first plugged the set in I noticed that the sound quality was loud, but not as sharp or fine tuned to my liking. This was not a hard problem to fix, even for someone like me with little or no prior HDTV experience. I pressed menu, then Sound, and then tweaked the EQ to my liking, matter settled. My apartment is not small, I'd say it's a good sized living room area, the sound is really strong. Perhaps the sound issues come with more of a spacious viewing area?Gaming: My friend game over to play Gears of War with me, his response after a 15 minute online session, \"You're TV is amazing dude. I can't believe how good this picture looks. I'm jealous man.\"5 stars in the 720p catagory.","Date":"May 20, 2007"}

I decided on LCD because I have a lot of light coming into my family room, and there is never any glare with this tv.  I still only have a standard satellite signal, but it looks great.

{"Title":"Five Stars","Author":"Dustin R. Segretto \"Connoisseur of Fine Things\"","ReviewID":"R31S5F5MMYCZ9K","Overall":"good","Content":"When it's time to buy something as substantial as a TV, I do my research.  In the past year I have researched every aspect of plasma vs LCD, 720p vs 1080p, dynamic contrast ratio vs native contrast ratio, and beyond.  I've gone to multiple showrooms and fiddled with settings on every brand of TV sold in my region.  And after all of this research, I found the Samsung LNT4053H LCD TV to be the best combination of value and features, by far.The picture on the Samsung LNT4053H is unbelievably crisp and detailed.  But bear in mind that the picture will only be as crisp as the input you send it; if you're hoping to hook up your janky standard-def cable and hope this thing turns it into eye-popping high-def, then you're going about it all wrong.  This TV is made for a clean HD signal to show off what it can do.The first thing you should do with this TV is go into the picture settings and turn off the DNIE setting.  Having DNIE on basically turns the color saturation WAY up, which makes everything look very unnatural and dream-like.  After you turn that off, there are a ton of other picture adjustment options for you to play with to customize your viewing experience.  I'm still working on getting mine dialed in just right.The Samsung LNT4053H is only 720p, but every legitimate source of tech information I could find (CNet, Buy.com, etc) says that there is no difference between 720p and 1080p until your TV is at least 50\".  This TV is only 40\", so it is well below that threshold.  I can vouch for the fact that this TV looked exactly as good as the 40\" 1080p sets next to it.The input selection is also best in class.  It has three HDMI inputs, two coaxial inputs (for cable as well as an over-the-air antenna), and plenty of component and composite hookups for your earlier-generation technology like a VHS player or original Sony Playstation.As far as the sound from the TV goes...why are you concerned with the sound from the TV?  Do you really have a TV this nice and no external stereo system?  If you want to compare how this TV sounds compared to a good 5.1 surround setup, then yes, it sounds terrible.  But it has tiny TV speakers for goodness sakes, just like every other TV made, ever.  NO TV has good speakers, because good speakers are expensive and do not fit inside of a slim television.  For anyone out there judging the quality of a TV by its speakers, please stop.  It's not worth taking away a star for that.I can't speak to the quality of the remote, because I use a Logitech Harmony universal.  I can say that this TV integrates flawlessly with it.  If you don't have a good universal remote, get one.  It's worth it.Another thing I was pleased with was the response time of switching inputs and changing channels.  Some TVs have a more noticeable lag for these operations, but the Samsung LNT4053H is pretty snappy.  You can hide inputs you aren't using, and rename the ones you are using.  You can also add customized names for each channel.  You get 5 characters to name each channel, such as \"DSCVR\" or \"HGTV\" which is helpful and a nice customization to have.  There is also a \"favorites\" feature whereby you can designate channels as favorites so you can switch between your most frequently viewed channels.  And if you want, you can completely remove channels so that you don't have to deal with flipping over the Lifetime Movie Network every time you're on your way to Comedy Central.This is a fantastic TV, and as of December 2008 it can be had for as little as $900 shipped if you do some smart online shopping.  But don't take my word for it; go look at televisions in the showroom, read reviews, and learn what the specs mean.  Most TVs aren't necessarily \"better\" or \"worse,\" but usually just \"different.\"  This TV satisfied every one of my criteria for a good set, so I'm extremely pleased with it.","Date":"December 29, 2008"}

What a great TV at a bargain price on Amazon. This was our first big ticket online order and the experience was great. Not only did we get the lowest price, but it came with free white glove delivery - very professional, careful and on time. Would highly recommend buying from Amazon if you know exactly what you want.  The TV picture is great for HD, STD Def. and DVD, and there are tons of adjustments for everything. The TV is located in a bright sunlit room and the anti-glare screen works beautifully.  The piano black finish with swivel base is great, but shows a lot of dust quickly. TIP: Instead of dusting with a cloth, use the pressurized air in a can for cleaning computers. Works great, fast and leaves no residue or scratches. The sound is mediocre, but I hooked it up to a home theater system and don't use the TV speakers.  Sounds great. Overall, a great TV at a great price and a wonderful buying experience.","Date":"December 28, 2007"}

Cruz \"PaulNYC\"","ReviewID":"RDL4ZSZHC7J17","Overall":"good","Content":"I ordered this on the 21st and it arrived after 4 business days even though I took the standard free shipping.  I purchased it for my brother \"were roomates\".  He hasn't had the opportunity to get an HD cablebox yet but it is connected to both an xbox 360 and a ps3. We have viewed many blu-ray movies and logged many gaming hours on it, mostly Halo2-3, Madden, Heavenly Sword and bioshock.The picture quality with his standard cable box is as expected, mediocre, however when viewing blu-ray movies or playing games it is similar to my LNS-4095D 1080p(in my bedroom) and I seriously can't tell the difference IF and this is a big IF its on 720p. We have both noticed that if the console output on the 360 or ps3 are set to 1080i on fast moving games the edges are noticeably blurry.  Not bad but you can definitely notice it and it does effect competitive game play IMHO.However when set to 720p my eye can't pickup any of the former blurriness and on this superb 40\" set I can't see a difference between my 1080p and his 720p.  The colors and black levels are all very good \"once you tweak the settings\".  However its not quite as crisp and brilliant as my living room set, Sony bravia 46XBR2.  However that sets not even comparable in cost.  Also if you are going with a 46\" or larger set I suggest 1080p at 40\" its not noticeable to the vast majority of consumers.The sound is barely adequate since it is a bedroom set but anyone who wants to have this in the living room should invest in a sound system. The connections are very convienent and needed as he has 3 HDMI devices (cablebox, 360 elite, ps3).I would highly recommend this set like stated early can't get better bang for your buck than than this set.","Date":"October 9, 2007"}

All the connection ports lets you connect directly to the TV and just search for the source of video and not have to \"daisy\" all your connections from your dvd player, vcr, sat. receiver, and tv. DVDs are wonderful and the color just pops! The tv is bigger than you think. Once you get it out of the box you say, \"Man I'm glad I didn't go bigger.\" The sound is great even with red/white audio cables.  I would highly recommend. So far, again just 1st day, no problems with the sound ... keeping my fingers crossed. I saved about $450 buying it here, plus free shipping which is another story.Only disappointment was the delivery (Cincinnati, OH to Columbus, OH where it sat for 5 days which caused a problems since I was going to be out of town and finally to Memphis, TN. If you look at a map, you can tell that was a waste of gas (go up to go down through Cincinnati, again). Was to get White Glove Delivery. The driver refused to take the tv out of the box until my wife insisted so she can at least check it for damage (I was not at home, but at work) and refuse to test to see if the tv worked, or to take the box as stated by Amazon's White Glove Service. He said that was not the delivery type he provided. Kinda snippy about it all. Will have to ask them about that, but the tv looked and works fine.","Date":"August 2, 2007"}

It should only show you the sources connected to the TV but this set has a mind of its own.2. Power Up. There's an annoying white/blueish light that comes on at the bottom of the unit. Its very distracting and has not aesthetic appeal whatsoever. In face it looks as if the light from the LCD crystals are leaking through a fault.3.

The brought it in, unpacked it, moved it to my desired location, made sure that the remote worked and that it was receiving a picture. Definitely A+ service!As for the TV itself? It was and still is as nice as I had hoped. The picture quality is clear, the sound is true and it looks beautiful. Besides watching TV, one of the features I've enjoyed are the A/V connections on the side which have allowed me to plug in my camera or camcorder for quick viewing on a large screen.

{"Title":"Great TV, some shipping headaches","Author":"Honda Driver","ReviewID":"RR1YJNMXNUY6U","Overall":"good","Content":"Bought TV based on Consumer Reports Review and I am very happy with this purchase. Size is just right for our typically sized family room.  Any bigger and I think it would be like sitting in the front row of a theater.  Since all the TV's I looked at in stores were just hooked up with coax tuned to channel 3 or 4 it was hard to judge which looked best since the picture quality was only as good at the analog source so I had to trust Consumer Reports testing.  At home DVD's using component video look almost like high def and Dish Network receiver using HDMI is also great.  I get local channels over the air using digital channels and they look awesome, which was a pleasant surprise since I thought the HDTV might highlight the flaws of our SD broadcasts in Erie, PA.  Over the air  old analog channels look a little rough though.  The only problem I had was with the local delivery agent for the Eagle shipping company used by Amazon.  They missed one appointment to deliver and I had some bizarre conversations over the phone with the local agent claiming they had never talked to me before and then hung up on me. TV did arrive in perfect condition eventually.","Date":"January 11, 2008"}
{"Title":"Beautiful TV, a few minor issues","Author":"C. Vasco","ReviewID":"R3HDB4LRDPF5B2","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is great. Blacks are black, colors are accurate, images are sharp. With the built-in digital receiver you can get over-the-air HDTV channels that are simply beautiful. One complaint is sometimes if the image is mostly low-contrast with subtle tones of greys and darker colors, there is motion blur. This effect isn't noticeable for high-contrast images like sports. Great for football, especially with the \"Vivid\" image setting and the HDTV over-the-air feeds from national channels.I'm also using this TV as a computer monitor, using DVI-HDMI converter. Games look great. Not so good for web browsing because the max 1360x768 make it hard to see much, have to scroll down a lot. Kinda wish I had gone with a 1080p just for the extra resolution with the PC.On the speakers: sufficient for television, but a receiver + nice speakers are good idea if you want a good setup for movies.","Date":"October 6, 2007"}

After that worked out smoothly I hooked up my brothers xbox 360 and quickly ran the bioshock demo. The picture was beautiful much better then the 19 inch sd tv he plays on. The last thing I tested the tv with was my Philips Upconvert dvd player(Philips HTS3555 Home Theater System with iPod Connectivity (Black)) I picked up some hdmi cables from monoprice.com when i ordered my tv for about 4-5bucks each and used them for the philips. Plugged everything in easily set everything up and the picture was amazing. I would give the tv 5 stars but its still too early to give it that.","Date":"August 22, 2007"}

The picture leaves much to be desired.  I experienced a significant amount of noise thorugh a variety of inputs including component and hdmi connections.  Edge definition was sharp but was plauged by digital interference.  I calibrated the picture using the nice array of availiable settings but this did nothing to help the poor definition of the picture.  Over the air hd lacked the definition of other sets I've viewed.  The color and contrast was fairly good but clarity is not this television strong suit.Overall the picture is good but plagued by weak noise filtering resulting in a less than perfect picture, and if your going to pay for it, then it should be perfect, nothing less.I purchased a Sony Bravia 40\" 720p and though it has its own weaknesses I would recommend it over this set any day.","Date":"December 30, 2007"}

Much better than the Samsung 3241 I had bought earlier this year. That model had a 3000:1 contrast ratio whereas this model has 8000 to 1. Much better color range and more shades of black.A 32inch LCD is like a stretched 27inch TV so 40 inches is much better if this is your main TV.I do have problems with the picture and sound on CBS. could be a bad signal from where I live. my last tv had an even worst CBS reception.Maybe some are confusing bad reception of certain channels with sound dropout.Hopefully the TV will continue working well.My wife had a gathering last night and her girlfriends really liked the look of the TV.","Date":"November 24, 2007"}

I hooked up my six year old standard definition Sony DVD player and was amazed by the beautiful display.  I am renting a DVR from my cable company; connections were made with component cables instead of HDMI. So far everything is working as I had hoped.The HD displays are beautiful and the standard definition picture is very good.  I have had no problems with the sound.  The menu is very easy to navigate. The swivel feature is something I use often and I love it.  The black frame is a design that I feel blends well with traditional or modern decor.

After a year or two (after the warranty expires), I (and many other people -- review online blogs) have had the capacitaor fail on the tv. The result is a clicking noise when you try to power on, as the tv continually tries to recycle. It takes 5 minutes, sometimes more, for the tv to start, and it constantly clicks. Samsung is well aware of the problem and is refusing to fix it, despite numerous complaints from many people. The customer service is just awful.

{"Title":"Multiple Technical Problems","Author":"Josh \"Go Cardinals!\"","ReviewID":"RLV2O0UDLMS13","Overall":"bad","Content":"Like most people I had one major problem with this unit right away which was the sound cutting out regularly.  Samsung tech support did do a good job remedying the problem by express mailing a thumb drive with a firmware update that fixed the sound issue immediately.  After that I didn't have any problems for quite some time until about 2 1/2 years after purchase the set started having serious difficulties starting up.  After being turned off for a long time, turning the set on took about 3-5 minutes during which clicking noises would occur.  Once the set finally turned on, often there was no sound and even sometimes no picture.  Samsung has no firmware update to fix this and recommended that I be referred to a service center who said it could cost from $150-300 to fix with several days of waiting.The TV in the end, seemed like a good purchase but after all of the problems I've encountered I couldn't consider buying another Samsung TV.","Date":"November 6, 2010"}

Also the tv remote burned out after six months of use. Samsung graciously repaired the dvd player and replaced the remote. In 2007 I tried buying the Samsung slimfit crt tv. I had to return three tv's due to audio problems (I bought the Sony wega crt tv) . It appears Samsung consistently has audio problems with their tv's.

The screen looks great even in a brightly lit room and shows no glare at all from reflections on-screen.I only have two very minor complaints.  First, the remote isn't great.  It's not very intuitive to use I find, and although it is supposed to work with the Samsung AnyNet DVD player I got with it (DVD-1080P8), it is terrible for that (it doesn't even have a \"menu\" button for the DVD play menu).  So I just use two remotes instead of one.  Not a big deal.My second complaint is even more minor.  There are many inputs in the back of the set (which is excellent), but if you need to change the input source channel, you often have to scroll through several options to find the correct one.  It would be handy if it could autodetect what is plugged in and what is providing a signal, and skip those channels that are not powered up.Overall, a very good set and it looks GREAT.","Date":"July 8, 2008"}

Currently the Tv is pricing around $1,000, so not quite as good of a deal, but I would still say it's a fantastic purchase.  Great picture, plenty of hookups, and 2 coax inputs (for a cable box and an external antenna, which really can't be beat for crisp free OTA hdtv for local channels), there really is nothing bad to say about the set.After reviewing lots of tvs online and in person, I'd say this series of the Samsung lcd line is a great value for the price and one of the best lcds out there right now.

Being right out of school, the first thing I wanted to buy with that first \"real job\" money was a flat screen TV.  At first I was going to get the best quality set for the cheapest price.  I set my mind on a 32 inch VIZO without much research, but the price was right and it looked good on display at the stores.  However I waited, and began seeing 32 inch Samsungs for $800 at Best Buy.  This seemed like a better choice since I heard Samsung was a top brand for LCDs.  I held off on getting the TV yet again, and then a friend told me that Amazon had good prices on TVs.  I was never a fan of online shopping and had never used Amazon before because I'm an instant gratification person, like to walk out of a store with my purchase rather than wait on shipping.  But for $200 more I was going to get a 40\" instead of a 32\", so it became my first Amazon purchase.

It has a shiny black finish and a the screen leaves just over an inch of border on its edges - more TV and less box.

{"Title":"Definitely worth the money!","Author":"Ron","ReviewID":"R33NMP0XFDCWNQ","Overall":"good","Content":"VIDEO (*****)The quality of video for this 720p TV is remarkable.  As a sports fan, I was concerned about motion blur with LCD's over the last year or two, but after researching, I realized that it's not an issue with modern day LCD's.  The 120Hz is just hype.  I have absolutely no blur with my TV that I have accepting signals from the DirecTV HD-DVR (HR121).  Sports look spectacular and movies look great as well.  I was very pleased with the standard definition picture as well.  If you're sitting too close to it, you can see artifacts, but my couch is almost eight feet away and I can rarely see artifacts in SD.AUDIO (***)This is really the only think that kept me from giving it five stars overall.  With home theatres today, sounds from the TV isn't that big of an issue and I think the guys from Samsung had that in mind when making this one.  It's not bad, but it's nothing that will blow you away at all.  I will give it credit for handling speech very well.  It's a very clear and crisp sound.FEATURES (*****)This think has a ton of features.  Different fonts of closed captioning, deep calibrating options, three picture modes and sound modes.  16:9, 4:3, Just Scan, Zoom 1, Zoom 2 and I think I forgot one.  Side-by-side PIP, top/bottom PIP, and conventional PIP.  The only catch to that is that one signal has to be digital (HDMI or component) and the other has to be analog (S-Video, A/V, or coaxial).  I was able to do PIP with my Xbox (via component) while watching TV with my TiVo (via S-Video).  I'm not able to play X while watching my HR121 (via HDMI).  Adding/deleting stations is a breeze!  It's very user-friendly and even someone who isn't a techie can use it.  There's a USB (Wiselink) port in the back and I used it to view photos and even play MP3 background music during my slideshows.  The remote is pretty good as well.  Easy to use with one hand although it's a little long for my taste.  I have a Harmony 880 now, so I rarely use it.  You only have to cycle through inputs that are being used not every single one of them.  That saves a lot of time.OVERALL (****)I absolutely love this TV.  I've been in the market for HD for 2 years now and this TV finally made me feel comfortable enough to make a purchase.  I feel like it was well worth the wait.  It handles all types of programming well (even black & white movies) and it responds quickly to the remote control.  I got it for $1100 at a local electronics store here in Jackson, MS.  Anyone saying 1080p is superior to 720p hasn't really watched a 720p.  From a distance of six feet or more, if you can tell the difference between the two, you have to be a professional.","Date":"December 27, 2007"}

I researched the purchase for over a year and using a matrix I selected this set for the overall value. It had a great picture, decent sound, and an outstanding price-point for 1080p. We've had it in our home for about 3 weeks now and love everything about it. My son plays his Xbox 360 on the set and is amazed at the difference from our previous non-hdtv system. It was easy to hook-up and enjoy quickly. The only reason I do not rate it as 5 stars is that 3 weeks is just too brief.... and I know there are a few better sets out there, but for the money.... you can't go wrong.

I have only noticed two problems with the tv. One is that when a scene changes or a show goes to commerical and the screen goes black there is a residual outline of what was jsut being shown. It does go away though. I'm not sure what causes it but its not that big of a deal. Also the volume control is annoying. You can't push and hold the volume button you have to click ever time you want it to move one space. Oh - and there is an annoying sound that is made when you turn it on and off but we programmed the tv to get rid of that sound.As an FYI to Time Warner Cable users - when you go to chage in your cable box for an upgraded HD box they give you the cables you need to hook up the tv.

{"Title":"Nice but could be better","Author":"Mike Hall","ReviewID":"R168JHF8GHWJU4","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm not an expert reviewer but a reasonably knowledgeable electronics consumer.  Here are my observations from a week's use of the LNT3253H. I won't repeat the specifications and the like that you can find most anywhere. I suspect that some of what I say is applicable to other panel sizes in the 2007 53 series.A successor to last year's popular 51 series, the 53 is really more of an updated version of 2006's highly rated LNS3296 with a little more contrast and one more HDMI port and a USB port.  (I was told by Samsung customer service, 1-800-726-7864, that the successors to the latter line will be 1080p.)PROSSharp picture with vibrant color in HD.  Subjectively:  when viewing HD feeds in the showroom, the 2006 version of the Sony Bravia XBR has better picture processing than this model, and the 2007 Toshiba Regza is comparable to the LNT3253.Very high quality panel with no dead pixels.  It is said that Sony and Samsung LCD panels come from the same Samsung plant.  My set was manufactured (probably assembled) in Mexico.Uses the desirable Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) according to Samsung customer service.Nice contrast; I was told by many people, though, that dynamic contrast has a bit of marketing hype to it so just don't buy an LCD model because the dynamic contrast is slightly better than a competitor's.  Sony avoids talking about it and their Bravia sets produce excellent pictures.2 RF inputs, one for antenna and the other for cable/satellite.  Competitors I've seen don't have that feature in their 2007 32\" sets.Digital tuner is high quality; very sensitive.  Let me clarify that the digital ATSC tuner will receive analog NTSC signals.  That's not entirely clear from the product specs, and competitors usually indicate their tuners are ATSC/NTSC/QAM.  This HDTV does all of that.Remote is logical and easy to use; better than the 2007 Regza's (I didn't compare it to the Sony's).  Nice that the Samsung recognizes input sources and allows one button scrolling through connected ones rather than having to go to a menu.  Don't know if source labeling or picture settings by source are available.Audio:  pretty typical, meaning not superb but adequate.For the most part, a well-engineered and elegant set with nice touches, like unobtrusive function buttons in the front (some other manufacturers like Sharp and Toshiba just don't get it that some sets will go into tight spaces like cabinets; they put the on-board function buttons on the top or side of the unit--how inconvenient).CONSThe single pedestal stand is a nice piece of engineering but could not be securely fastened to the set I purchased, so it was wobbly and, worse, made the set noticeably sag to one side.  I checked two other display units in electronics stores and discovered that they did wobble.  Other 32\" sets from Sony, Sharp, and Toshiba, while not capable of turning on their pedestals, are solidly anchored.  I don't know whether it's a design or manufacturing flaw -- or both.720p resolution, 8 ms response time, and 10-bit processing. Most experts seem to think there's really no discernable difference in 32\" sets between 720p and 1080p at typical viewing distances of 8 to 10 feet. I disagree; there is a difference to my eyes.  Eight ms response is good, but 6 ms is better for action scenes.  Samsung touts 10-bit processing on last year's 96 series models, but not on this one (which Samsung customer service confirmed to me it has).  Perhaps that's because competitors are upping the ante with 14-bit and better processing.Blacks are not as black as they should be on this set, and most annoying, there is some residual image on occasion.  The test:  MGM's lion logo goes immediately to black for about a second before a program begins.  On my 19\" Samsung Synchmaster LCD, the black stays black after the logo disappears.  Same thing on my 12 year-old Panasonic direct-view (CRT) 32\" set.  Not so on this set; a residual reverse image of the MGM logo lingers on the black screen.Legacy analog from over-the-air analog broadcasting and VCR is substantially lower quality than on my analog set.  I know that Samsung claims its engine helps make analog pictures look sharper, and they do when DNIe is turned on, but they're still disappointing when compared to a quality analog set.  (Digital broadcasts and DVDs are fine; I use the excellent Sony DVP-NS75H upscaling DVD player.)An audio nit:  My old Panasonic TV allowed control of the sound level output and muting of the home theater receiver from its remote.  This set's remote does not do that, requiring the use of the receiver's remote for volume control and muting.  The Samsung's is supposed to be universal, though, and might be programmed to do so.  Another nit:  Muting is not 100% complete.  There was slight sound leakage in all muting situations (both from the remote and \"internal muting\") on my set.  It seemed like Lilliputians had taken up residence inside the set.NOTESYou can turn off the obtrusive (to me) bottom blue light if desired from the menu.Samsung has some info on their website about the unit, including the product manual (very nice--why can't competitors do something this simple and helpful?).The power cord is detachable from the set (yes!).  It's three-pronged, with a grounding prong (reflects Samsung's monitor heritage?).A brief note about size for those of you changing from old-style analog direct-view sets to an LCD like this.  A 32\" analog set is a 4:3 ratio set; while a 32\" HDTV LCD set is \"widescreen\" at the theater-like 16:9 ratio.  What this means in practice is:  on your old analog set some DVDs and broadcast HDTV programs are centered on the set with black bars at the top and bottom (some DVD players will allow you to \"zoom\" and crop the picture to fill up the set, but you lose program's side action).  They should fit just fine in your new LCD, though.  Analog content that fills up the screen of your old analog 32\" set is centered with black bars at the sides on your new LCD set.  In effect, with older content, it's like watching a program on a 26\" set, not a 32\" set, according to the experts.  I hope this isn't too confusing.  The bottom line for me:  when replacing a 32\" analog set, think about going to a larger 37\" or 40\" LCD set if your budget and shelving can manage it.I discovered that my AmEx and Master Charge extend the in-home parts and labor service warranty for an additional year; my Visa does not, so it might be a good idea to check with your credit card company prior to purchase.There were a few issues with the LNT3253H that surfaced during the week that I owned it.  I strongly recommend thoroughly previewing (kicking the tires, as it were and checking your preferences) this or any other large screen TV before buying it from any online retailer (BTW, it seems that most of them will not accept returns).  You may wish to check with Amazon customer service to find out exactly what the return and refusal policies are, since, as many of you know, once you hit the \"buy\" button you may get the dreaded \"your order is being processed, you can't make any changes\" message if you change your mind.The set and box are not heavy and can be handled reasonably well by one person.","Date":"April 14, 2007"}
{"Title":"From an LCD-HDTV first-timer...","Author":"Steve R","ReviewID":"R3RPQJJSAIBLU1","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this set a week ago, after our 11-year-old, 32-inch, JVC tube TV shorted out. I'd had plenty of experience with LCD computer screens but I'd never really experienced anything but tube TV before. So, although I did plenty of homework before buying the Samsung, it's been a week of learning a LOT of new stuff. Here's what this newbie has learned so far, which will probably be helpful mostly for those who have yet to venture into the land of LCD and HDTV.THE TV ITSELF:Although the Samsung was my among my top picks after doing the research, when I saw it on the wall at Best Buy, the decision was pretty much made. Although I know the stores crank up the brightness and contrast, I figure if they do it for all the sets they have, then you're still on a relatively level playing field. And the picture on the Samsung stood out from the others like a diamond in a mound of charcoal. Rich contrast, sharp resolution, bright without being glaring. (We settled on the 32-inch because our family room is tiny and we are not more than five or six feet away from the screen. Standing that close to the larger sets was kind of overwhelming.)When I got it home I wasn't disappointed, and found the same qualities in the set I purchased as the store model. It was fairly simple to hook up to my cable box and DVD player, and I was watching TV within half an hour. Everything was pretty intuitive, which is good because I am NOT a read-the-directions kind of guy. And the piano-black casing is stunning, although, as another reviewer mentioned, the stand can be a bit wobbly. Be very careful if you have little ones who like to mount furniture.There is a variety of settings for picture and sound quality (including an equalizer mode). The sound is adequate but not dazzling. However, for movies and concerts, I usually channel the sound through my DVD player anyway. I was especially happy to find effective settings to adjust screen brightness for ambient room light, because our family room has a huge wall of windows that make the room extremely bright, so much so that on brilliant sunny days, our old tube TV was almost unwatchable. So far, I've yet to see any conditions in which I can't see the LCD screen perfectly.Overall, the Samsung seems to deliver well on its promises, but what impressed me most (again, keep in mind I'm a newbie here) was the picture on HD channels. It's simply amazing. I was watching a baseball game in HD the other day and they showed a slow-motion replay of a player sliding into second base. You could see every grain of dirt on the base path. The definition is mind-boggling. However...THE LCD/HD EXPERIENCE...Though I was most impressed with the HD picture, I was also disappointed in the non-HD resolution. I guess the most important thing I can impart to other newbies is this... LCD/HD sets are really made for high-definition broadcasting. On those channels (which now make up maybe five percent of my cable company's offerings) the picture is superb. On all the other channels broadcasting in standard format, however, the image appears in a standard-format square on your new wide screen, and the resolution (which used to be great on the tube TV) is actually pretty poor, depending on what you're watching. Additionally, keep in mind that the full-screen image on your tube TV will be much smaller on a wide-screen TV of the same size. Both the Samsung and my cable box have options for changing the picture size, so that you can expand the square image to fit the wide-screen format. But this only distorts the image and can make it even blurrier while cutting off a significant portion of the picture. Also, there's not a lot of standardization in the way different stations format their picture: most are just in 4:3; some are in \"wide screen/letter box\" but it doesn't fill the whole TV screen, it just appears as a rectangle picture surrounded by a larger black rectangle; and some that are in full-wide-screen mode still leave a black strip at the top and bottom of the screen. I'm considering getting the cable company's \"HD Tier\" package just so I'll have more HD channels to watch, even though the programming isn't all that spectacular.So, if you're considering this Samsung as your first foray into the world of HD, I think you'll be impressed. But be prepared to sacrifice size and quality on your non-HD channels (and there are MANY), and don't think that when you bring the set home, suddenly those \"I Love Lucy\" reruns on TVLand will be in stunning wide-screen high-definition clarity. It doesn't work that way. In fact, it works the OTHER way. The HD capabilities just bring out the flaws in broadcasts that were never meant for HD.Hope this helps.","Date":"July 27, 2007"}
{"Title":"Excellent HD TV, But Requires High Quality Video Feed","Author":"Buddy S","ReviewID":"R1N72RS96D131T","Overall":"good","Content":"This TV is capable of producing outstanding video, but it demands a very high quality video feed (HD source through an HDMI cable) to perform up to its full potential.  The video adjustments also require considerable tweaking to achieve optimum performance.I have owned my Samsung 32\" HDTV (model LNT3253H) for about six weeks.  The TV is connected to a Comcast HD Motorola cable box with an HDMI cable.  The HD video quality is excellent and the standard definition TV video quality is surprisingly good.  It is important to note that these results were achieved only after a good deal of tweaking with the video adjustments.  I usually avoid looking at instructions, but I found that this is one product where reading the Owner's Instructions was very helpful.  There are a large number of possible adjustments, including some that I had never heard of before.  These include Gamma, Color Space, White Balance, Edge Enhancement and Digital Natural Image Engine (DNIe).  The Instructions explain what each adjustment does and the on screen Menu permits you to see the effect of each adjustment on the fly, as the adjustments are made.  There are also a large number of video source inputs, including 3 HDMIs, probably more than most people will ever need.The TV audio is surprisingly good, especially considering the fact that the sound comes out of two small slits in the front bottom of the cabinet.  TV audio is not a big issue for me, however, because I have a home theater system that I usually use when watching TV.  But I have no hesitation in using the TV speakers on occasion.  The TV sound does not approach home theater quality, but it is perfectly acceptable for watching many programs, especially those that do not involve music or are not broadcast in surround sound.I have a very old outdoor analog rooftop antenna that was connected to my previous TV, a 27\" Sony cathode ray tube set.  The Sony pulled in about six local analog channels through this antenna.  The new Samsung, connected to this old antenna, receives nothing that is watchable.  I have not tried an HDTV antenna with the new Samsung.The DVD video quality, using a standard definition progressive scan DVD player that did not perform upconverting (a JVC XV-N44SL) was only fair to good -- nothing special.  I was disappointed with these results and purchased a new Sony upconverting DVD player (a DVP-NS90V).  The Sony DVD player connected to this TV with an HDMI cable produced a dramatic improvement in video quality.  I have not deducted from my 5 star rating for this product because of the lackluster non-upconverting DVD player video and poor antenna performance.  I did not buy the TV to watch analog over the air TV broadcasts and I assume the antenna performance would improve if I were to use a new antenna designed for HD reception.  Also, the DVD picture quality did improve significantly with an upconverting DVD player.UPDATE 11/13/2007:  I recently purchased an HDTV indoor antenna (a Terk HDTVa.)  With the Terk antenna connected, the TV pulled in 18 local over the air channels and 5 of these were in high defintion.  The high definition reception was crystal clear.  Also, those local HDTV stations broadcast in Dolby 5.1 audio were received in 5.1.  My five star rating for this product remains unchanged.UPDATE 1/26/2008:  As stated above, I usually did not use the TV speakers while watching this TV.  But, about 6 weeks ago while watching two back to back NFL football games on a Sunday afternoon with the TV speakers on, I experienced the \"audio drop off problem\" several times.  (This problem is discussed by some other reviewers and in an Amazon customer discussion thread.)  The audio cut off completely.  I could temporarily cure the problem by turning the TV off and then back on again or by using the remote to scroll through the input sources back to my football game (on an HDMI input) or by turning the cable box off and then on.I called Samsung during that week and the service representative recommended \"resetting\" the TV which consisted unplugging the TV for 30 seconds.  I told him I would do this, but added that I wanted the current firmware version for the TV.  He then sent me an email, which led to a link on Samsung's website and I was able to download the new firmware to a USB flash drive.  The email had complete instructions on how to obtain and install the firmware upgrade.  The flash drive plugged into the left side of the TV and I had no problem installing the upgrade.  After resetting the TV and installing the upgrade, I have had no problem with the TV audio and I have made heavy use of the TV speakers in the last six weeks to make certain the problem is resolved.My TV was manufactured in Mexico in March, 2007 and it was shipped with firmware version 1006 and now has version 1022, with the recent upgrade.  I should note that \"resetting\" the TV caused it to loose all the user adjustments I had made to the default settings, including adjustments to the TV video.  I now write down and keep in a safe place the numerous adjustments I made to the default settings on this TV - if you loose power or unplug the TV, all of these adjustments will be gone.I also note with some concern that a few Amazon reviewers who purchased recently manufactured versions of this TV continue to encounter audio problems.  A TV that can not produce reliable audio is a serious problem.  I, however, am not changing my 5 star rating for this product because I have to judge this TV based on my experience and not that of others - the audio problem I encountered was quickly resolved by \"resetting\" the TV and installing the firmware upgrade.","Date":"August 13, 2007"}
{"Title":"Know the ins and outs before you buy an HD TV","Author":"Penfist \"Dulce bellum inexpertis\"","ReviewID":"RP90BR404PL7A","Overall":"good","Content":"This Samsung TV is an excellent product. We bought it as a bedroom TV to replace a 26 inch conventional model. Understand that this TV is going to have a higher resolution than most of the signals you will send it. We have the system hooked up to DISH HD, a Playstation 2 and a Zenith DVD/VCR combo. The DISH HD output looks pretty good via HDMI. The Playstation 2 output is as good as you can get from a Playstation 2. The Zenith output is often pixelated and grainy. That's what happens when you mix and match old technology with new technology. I can live with it but consumers have a responsibility to understand that this TV will not make your old videotapes look better. In fact, they will look worse. So will DVDs unless you invest in progressive scan.The TV itself is well designed with an excellent picture (depending on source quality). Blacks look pretty black and we have experienced none of the blurring some older LCD TV owners complain about. Only one thing about this unit irritates me - the control on the right side of the TV itself. They are very hard to read. If you'll be using a remote exclusively it won't be a problem.Overall I look forward to years of happy ownership.","Date":"October 19, 2007"}
{"Title":"Best Bang For Your Buck","Author":"P. Irwin","ReviewID":"RN924OY4819RI","Overall":"good","Content":"For a 32\" LCD HDTV in this price range, i can't justify getting anything else. the TV is an absolute blast to use, the quality is amazing, it seems to be built well, and i'm immensely happy with it so far.SD Quality - like almost every LCD HDTV out there, the SD quality on this unit leaves much to be desired. it may be the poor cabling in my apartment for my cable channels, but they look pretty bad. i'm guessing that if you had a good quality cable line run to the TV, it would look better, because the digital SD channels from my cable box look pretty good. also, it's not the fact that it's SD that is the problem... because SD DVDs and 480i digital over-the-air look great. it's just cable, and presumably analog over-the-air as well. so make sure you have a good quality cable line run to your TV/cable box and maybe even an amplifier.HD Quality - outstanding. 1080i looks indistinguishable from 720p, as this is a 720p TV with a good 1080i deinterlacer. i don't know why someone tagged this as 1080p, since it clearly doesn't support it. but the quality is amazing, especially with the contrast as high as it is. I have not tried anything over HDMI, since i don't have any HDMI devices. but analog component looks great.Contrast - i have found some of the \"Dynamic\" settings can be a bit extreme... i actually had to tone down the contrast a little, and i turned the dynamic contrast to Low. Also, this is a very BRIGHT TV, but luckily you can adjust the backlight. on the backlight adjustment that goes to 10, i have mine set at 7, and it's still very bright.Games - i have a Nintendo Wii hooked up via component and it looks great. it's also nice since it supports 480p and 16:9 mode, so in the games, such as Wii Sports, you can have vertical split screen that is actually useful. There is also a \"game mode\" to enhance how games look on the screen, but i have not yet used this.Over-the-air - This TV does include an OTA tuner for HD and SD digital. I hooked up a cheap little unpowered antenna and i was able to pick up in-town 480i digital stations fine, and they looked AMAZING compared to their cable counterparts. I wasn't able to get any HD channels without a powered antenna, since all the broadcast towers are out of town, but i'd imagine you'd get a much better quality (assuming you can get a good signal) than from digital cable, which suffers from severe compression artifacts in my area.Inputs and Outputs - there are PLENTY to go around, but considering i have 6 component devices, it would be nice to have more component inputs. there are 3 HDMI inputs, one on the side, and two component sets. In addition there are 2 composite inputs for SD, one on the side, and a PC input. DVI is supported in the HDMI port with an adapter.Remote - the remote is easy to use and comfortable. There is a handy P.Size button at the bottom (blue button) that allows you to change between 16:9 stretched, Zoom 1 (cropped), Zoom 2 (i think an even tighter crop), and 4:3 pillarboxed for SD programs, which is very handy. For example, when a widescreen letterboxed program comes on an SD channel, you can go to Zoom 1 with a push of a button and it completely fills the screen, unletterboxed and unstretched. The volume and channel controls are also backlit with the touch of a button.Sound - the sound is a good and bad thing about this TV. it has a cool virtual surround feature that actually sounds pretty neat, especially while watching concerts and programs that make good use of stereo sound, and it has optical output to run to a 5.1 unit for audio from OTA HD or HDMI. The downside is that bass is lacking, but considering how thin the TV is, this is not surprising, and i'd posit that the sound on ths TV is better than other LCD HDTVs i've heard in stores. There is an equalizer as well to fine tune your  sound. Another cool feature is that the speakers are under the TV, so the bezel is significantly smaller than other competing units.Appearance - the unit is a piano black, plastic finish, and there is a glowing blue LED at the bottom. the LED is not distracting at all, and you can program it to be on when the TV is on or off, whichever you prefer. The whole unit is very customizable, you can adjust many tiny details of the image quality, sound quality, channels, and settings for the TV. The controls on the TV itself are touch sensitive and on the side of the unit. The only downside is you can't really see what they are unless you're in a brightly lit room, so i end up relying on the remote more than the controls on the unit. The upside of this is that you wouldn't know they're there upon looking at it, and it makes the bezel very attractive.","Date":"June 12, 2007"}

Zientek","ReviewID":"R2ULDFHAJ7218P","Overall":"good","Content":"***EDIT: Please read, as this is quite important new information***I wrote a review about a week ago praising the set. However, I came to notice a major issue. While displaying video over component or HDMI, most commonly in progressive scan resolutions (480p, 720p), my set has a \"tearing\" issue. This is a small horizontal line that moves up the screen from the bottom. It happens randomly. I did some research and found on the AVS forums that half the posters reported to have this problem with their set. Luckily, it can be fixed. You must call Samsung support, tell them you have the \"tearing\" issue and that you want the newest firmware, which remedies the problem. They will either send you a USB thumb drive in the mail with the firmware or they will provide you with a download link. This problem was quite bad for me when playing Xbox 360 in 720p over component video.So, to get the best performance, be sure to get this updated firmware, version 1020. You can read about this problem by searching \"tearing\" in Samsung's FAQ for the LN-T3253H.***********I've had my Samsung for about 2 weeks now and am throughly satisfied.  I did an enormous amount of research before purchasing this, and consider myself to be very knowledgeable regarding technology.  I was also considering the 32\" Sharp Aquos 1080p model and the Sony Bravia 32\" model.  I ended up choosing the Samsung because the Sharp was significantly more expensive (due to its 1080p capability) and because the Sony didn't look good enough to justify its higher price tag.  I use this set in my dorm room.It's hard to judge any LCD, however, in the store because they generally turn the brightness and contrast to their maximum values to make the TVs stand out.  I learned a very valuable lesson: calibrating your television truly does bring out the best picture.  Even if you don't buy a calibration DVD (like Avia or DVE), look up CNET's picture settings for this model.  While it won't look as \"good\" at first, your eyes adjust to it and notice more detail and a more lifelike picture.After calibration, my Samsung set produces a stunning image.  I have an Xbox 360 (Component), a Playstation 3 (HDMI), broadcast TV, and my Macbook Pro (VGA) all hooked up.  Picture from all sources is amazing.  What really surprised me, though, is how great my Mac looks on this TV.  It acts as a 1333x768 LCD monitor and the image is superb.  I used to have a 42\" DLP with my Mac connected via a DVI -> HDMI cable and the picture was just OK.  Now with the LCD, I plan on browsing the internet from my couch.Both DVDs and Blu-Rays look wonderful.  The speakers are underpowered and inadqueate.  If you're spending this much on a TV, it's only logical to get great sound as well.  Right now, I have audio sent to 2.1 channel Logitech THX speakers which sound leaps and bounds better than the built in ones.  (I'll be upgrading to 5.1 channel surround soon)  The stand is not wobbly like other reviews have said, perhaps they just overlooked something.  There is a ziploc of screws that comes in the box.  Be sure to screw them into the back of the set after you snap the stand on, it makes it much more secure.Bottom line, if you're in the market for a 32\" LCD, you've found it.  The image is excellent and it is truly the best deal.","Date":"August 8, 2007"}

{"Title":"Great TV But Had An Audio Problem","Author":"amazon man","ReviewID":"R2FBJWO59ZW3VD","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the Samsung LNT3253 on Monday. I bought an HDMI cable yesterday. It didn't take long for the audio to cut out and start stuttering. I'm not talking about a split second but cutting in and out continuously. I also have digital audio running into my stereo receiver and switched to that and it was fine. So the problem in that case was isolated to the HDMI source.  I had to unplug the TV and let it reset to get the sound back to normal. Then the audio was fine. I must say that kind of thing only happened once so far. Since, there have been very short sound and picture dropouts but they might have just been some kind of digital glitch from the cable company. I called up Samsung and they sent me a firmware update via email link. It turns out its the same as whats already on the TV. They could have saved me the effort by telling me how to check the firmware and confirmed that way it was already up to date. From what I read a new motherboard with its soundboard as part of it should solve the problem so I called Samsung and they setup up an appointment with an independent service center not Samsung to come work on the TV in a few days. The manager at the service center said they will replace the motherboard.  The service manager said he's already changed six boards. For the gentleman with the wobbly stand. Try screwing the stand to the screen and that should solve your wobble. If you just drop it on and don't screw it yes it will wobble and list to the side if its unbalanced.  A great picture, beautiful styling and great features, hopefully the sound problem was not a reoccurring problem and the board change will fix if it is was anyway. Well the service company came and changed the board and I watched the ballgame last night using the straight HDMI input and the sound was cutting out constantly. I'll watch TV again tonight on a different channel and see if the problem continues. If so I will return the TV and unfortunately have to purchase a Sony equivalent at a much higher price.","Date":"June 13, 2007"}
{"Title":"Loud Hissing Noise","Author":"Niki M.","ReviewID":"R20OAX7Y37M50C","Overall":"bad","Content":"My two-month old TV  has now started making a loud hissing sound that starts about 1 hour into viewing.  Nothing will stop it until I turn it off.  It's definitely the TV and not the cable hook-up because I have unplugged the cable and the TV still makes the noise.  The sound is like like the whistling noise a tea kettle makes when it's boiling--which means it is very loud and very annoying.Right now my brand new $900 Samsung TV is nothing more than a very expensive dust collector until it's fixed--and I am not happy about that one bit! I am so sick of modern technology not working!  My cheap old $100 Walmart tube TV works better than this.When I purchased this Samsung reviews were stellar and I didn't think twice about buying it.  Now I am reading all sorts of similar hissing and buzzing complaints.  Well but for the loud hissing sound, I would have given the TV a 5-star review too based on the picture quality and features.Since this technical issue is not happening on every TV all I can say is if you buy it, cross your fingers and hope you are one of the lucky ones--for two months I thought I was.  I hope Samsung can fix my TV and doesn't make me ultimately regret not purchasing the Panasonic TV I was looking at that also received rave reviews.UPDATE:  Samsung did fix my TV under warranty. I called Samsung.  Samsung put me in touch with a local TV repair shop.  Service shop picked up my TV and kept it for about two weeks to repair.  Returned it with hissing supposedly fixed.  A day later hissing started again.  Called Samsung back to complain.  Samsung sent the TV service shop another work order.  Service tech came by and said he had the parts to fix it right then.  An hour later, TV was fixed.  Haven't had a single problem since (it's now the end of July).The TV tech said Samsung used the wrong part on some models which causes the hissing.  Replace the part (which he did) and hissing should cease immediately (which mine did).Based on my experience, I would buy a Samsung again.  Great warranty service.","Date":"February 28, 2008"}

So far I am very pleased with this unit and it is meeting the expectations I had for it. This was the first TV that I have ever bought online. I had some concerns about buying a TV online but Amazon's price was $240 less than any local merchant, including the shipping fee. I've bought more expensive computers online with no problems so I figured there was nothing special about buying a TV the same way. Amazon shipped the unit the next day after I ordered it. They quoted almost 2 weeks for delivery but it arrived in a week in perfect condition.  In summary I'm very pleased with the TV as well as Amazon's service and would not hestitate to order a TV online again.","Date":"June 26, 2007"}

It has an audio problem - a high pitched whine that begins after about 20 minutes of use. It happens after it warms up and won't go away. The digital picture is good. The analog channels are not so good. But, the noise is driving me nuts. Others have had the same problem with audio according to the Amazon Blog.  Now I must  begin the process with Amazon to return it rather than \"give a more detailed description of the problem\" after contacting Samsung Customer Service.  Think twice about buying this 32\" model HDTV until Samsung gets their act together.","Date":"December 14, 2007"}

Kapes","ReviewID":"R1CPBPPWI4KLR3","Overall":"good","Content":"The technical performance of this TV seems very good. The features clearly make this a very versatile product and the price is right. But be certain to carefully look at a photo of the product before ordering. The design is quite \"mod\" and I found that the shiny plastic enclosure detracts from the viewing experience; while the picture is great, the black frame reflects any light source that's in the room. I guess from years of having Sony products I was expecting a more subtle enclosure. My fault for not looking more carefully. So if you have a modern house or apartment this set might be perfect. But you might choose differently if you are in a more traditional environment or might be bothered by reflections from the frame.","Date":"June 20, 2007"}

{"Title":"Bought it, experienced it, returned it.....","Author":"Brent Lowrey \"Brent\"","ReviewID":"RUS3ODZDTGZYN","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this exact model about a week ago, my wife and I saw it hanging on the wall at Best Buy and both agreed that the picture was sharp and it had a very sleek frame to it. We purchased it, took it home and got it set up. The first thing I noticed was the frame. Although it does look good, it is very cheap feeling. Theres is ALOT of flimsy plastic covering this lcd tv. I put that petty opinion aside and started watching it, the picture looked great and I also liked how the sound came from the back of the tv. Then it started....Audio dropping, about every 5-20 minutes 1-3 seconds of audio would just completely drop. Well to make a long story short I found out that this is a very known issue with this model. I didnt pay almost 900.00 for a lcd that has a \"known issue\" so I took it back and payed 200.00 more and purchased the Sony Bravia 32 inch, which looks fantastic and has amazing sound. You truly get what you pay for with LCD's, so in my opinion I would say to pass on Samsung.","Date":"November 25, 2007"}
{"Title":"Samsung 32\" LCD TV Model #LNT3253H","Author":"J. Gump","ReviewID":"R2NRLB0ZUJ05NK","Overall":"good","Content":"Just got this TV last week.  Overall the experience with Amazon and their shipping company was great.  TV was delivered inside the house and unpackaged.  From order to arrival, it was only 3 business days!The TV is well constructed as you would expect from Samsung.  The sound is great, the picture even greater.  Why buy anything else than a Samsung!  I have 2 of them now, the other a DLP.If you're considering a smallish LCD for a bedroom (like me), and thought about going the cheap route with D.R., Vizio, Olevia, etc., don't.  When you compare the features and picture and sound quality of these brands to the Samsung, it's worth the extra $200-$250 to get top quality.Setup was a breeze.  Nice side panel \"touch\" controls and a good remote.  Tons of connections in the back.  Very light weight. The stand is nice looking and functional, if maybe a bit loose, but once screwed in, no issues.Feature-wise it allows you to control about everything to customize the picture to your taste.  For a bedroom, an LCD screen is quite bright, but you're able to dim the backlight and the brightness to dim the image down to a more viewable picture that doesn't light up the whole room...without reducing image quality.  All the HDTV channels look beautiful, especially sports and HDT.  I have it hooked up via Comp Video, since my current cable box doesn't have HDMI.  I can't imagine much improvement through going HDMI, other than less cable clutter.  SDTV channels, while side-barred, are not bad either.  Maybe a bit better than my DLP, but it's close.Overall, if you're considering an LCD TV with 720p/1080i definition (I see no need to go with 1080p on this screen size,  Also-- NO ONE is broadcasting in 1080p and you couldn't tell the difference anyway at this screen size), this is the one to buy.  For less than $800, it's a great deal.  You will not be disappointed.","Date":"December 18, 2007"}

Track your order and ones you see it being delivered to eagle location near your area, just initiate the call yourself and arrange for delivery.  They bring it in and set it up.  Otherwise you will wait for few more days for them to call you.I am in NJ area using Cablevision.  For the first two weeks I was without IO and digital box.  So I was connected directly to the cable.  TV had no problem finding all available channels, including digital for ABC, NBC, FOX and few others.  They transmit in 720P and picture is just fantastic.  But you may need to control what mode to use on HD and SAP channels yourself.Running with DVR box:  First of all cablevision S. Atlanta DVR box produces really good quality.  But make sure you configure your box correctly to recognize all modes this TV supports.  Otherwise it does automatic conversion to what it thinks your TV supports.  Converting 720P to 1080i, no matter how good conversion chip is - still will not create original quality picture.  You want to see 720p transmitted channels in 720p and 1080i in 1080i.Connection: USE HDMI cables for DVD and digital cable box.  You can notice the difference in picture quality.  TV has two HDMI inputs in the back and I think one on the side.  There is also optical input, but I did not try it for sound yet.Short story.  Even without any adjustment the picture is stunning - no comparison to older model.  My TV is in the bedroom and surround sound is more than satisfying for the built-in speaker.  The only LCD that I can think of that may produce a bit better picture is Sony XBR2 or 4.  But in my mind the price difference is not worth the miniscule difference in quality.Note: If anyone played with colour calibration on this TV and found better settings - please email.Hope this helps.","Date":"November 7, 2007"}

Based on my research thus far, I'll give it a 5 star rating if/when Samsung takes care of their audio issues and I buy the unit instead of the Sony or Aquos/Sharp. BUT I've read on the Amazon LNT3253H forum having 21 RECENT comments on audio problems with that model!!! I see now that there is an audio prob comment in the LNT4053H forum and reference made in the 50\" product as well. I'm going to cut and paste a comment from the 3253 forum that seems to point to a problem with this generation of Samsung LCD HD units. This comment out of all of them seems to point to THE FIX by the Samsung service techs needing to swap out the main electronics board that includes the sound card...read on: In reply to an earlier post on May 23, 2007 7:26 PM PDTAndrew Chabak says:I had the same problem: as directed by Samsung I replaced the Comcast cable box, and then even replaced the HDMI cable. The problem remained. I contacted Samsung again, and they sent a Samsung repairman. He then replaced the main board which contains the sound card. Now it works correctly...no sound dropout! Also, I was told by the repairman, that this is a newer version of the board, and this problem has been fixed by him in the past. Call Samsung and ask for someone to come by and fix it. They have some bad boards in these. - Further comment by me: I see in the 3253 forum that there is reference made to other firmware or software updates/fixes being developed...yet those customers that have applied them still have the problem but at a lesser level of occurrence. I'll be calling Samsung tomorrow to see if they want my business .... and will judge how serious they are about tackling the issue that exists. Remembering that there is only a 30day return policy and 1yr warranty. I don't want a temporary bandaid that doesn't hit the actual root cause in longer term use after the warranty has run out.

Let me just say that this set is amazing, and so far I have yet to find any problems (i.e. No sound drop-out through HDMI connection, and no bugs reported) with it.  The experience of viewing High-Definition for the first time was amazing, you can actually see the sweat pouring down a pitcher's face in a baseball game.The LNT-3253H's sleek-black exterior matches perfectly with my entertainment center, and while it may easily attract dust and fingerprints, it's worth the extra hassle of cleaning it with the soft-cloth included in the box.  Dvd movies look magnificent on this set, even on a low-def player the \"Movie Mode\" picture setting helps bring out the true quality.  The ability to fine-tune the black levels, as well as the option to turn on \"Energy Saving\" with four different settings make the screen render beautifully.

{"Title":"Great picture, great remote, looks great, simple operation","Author":"alastan","ReviewID":"R3EQ7PN1W7ITTY","Overall":"good","Content":"I received the TV about a week ago purchased from Amazon & shipped by Amazon's free white glove delivery service.  The tv & box arrived damage free.  The trucking company that delivered the TV (EGL Logistics) telephoned to schedule a delivery, delivered the TV within the scheduled time period and opened the box and inspected the TV for damage.  The driver did a great job in showing me where to look on the tv for signs of shipping damge.Setup of the TV was simple - I did not even need to read the manual.  When you first turn the set on, the tv goes through an automatic setup which was very nice.  The remote control works very well and has a nice lighted display.  I initally thought about purchasing a less expensive Olevia model, but after reading owner reviews, it was clear that some TVs have less than desirable remote controls and cumbersome setup,  I wanted a TV where there was a high degree of owner satisfaction.The picture quality is excellent.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the sound that the tv is able to deliver.  I read a previous review where someone said the TV was not loud enough.  My living is 20' x 30' and I have not ever needed to get even close to having the sound turned up to 1/2 of maximum volume.  There is a clear plastic piece at the bottom of the TV that deflects the sound into the room.  I like this model other than less expensive Samsung models of the same size, becuase the speakers are on the bottom of the TV, rather than the sides of the screen which, to me, makes the set look better when hanging on the wall.Before buying, I went to the CNET.com website and they have a short video of their review of this TV.One thing that I wish the TV had is an electronic program guide similar to what can be received by digital cable or satellite.  When viewing over-the-antenna broadcasts, you can view a description of the programs that you are watching, but not find out what will be broadcast on the channel at a later time.  However, it's not really to big of a problem for me, because the TV has 2 coaxial antenna inputs.  I have the antenna connected to one and DISH satellite to the other.  By clicking on the antenna button on the remote, I can view an eletronic program guide and then switch back to antenna.  I do this, becuase I do not subscribe to DISH HD programming and just watch HD over my local channels over the antenna.After purchasing the TV and reading the owners maual, I found that there is a Samsung wall mount option that plugs into the back of the TV and using the TV remote control, you can move the entire tv up, down, left & right.  I'm not sure why you woulf want to do that, but you can with the optional wall mount.I ended up purchasing a Peerless ST640P for my Samsung and am very happy with the mount.  I chose this typ of mount over a mount with a single arm that can be pulled out from the wall and rotated left, right, up and down, becuase I wanted to install the mount to a wall stud, and my wall studs did not line up with the center of where I wanted the TV to be when flat against the wall.  The ST-640P allowed ofr me to place the mount off-center of where I wanted the TV and then I could move the TV on the mount approximately 5\" to the right or left to center the TV in the position I wanted.If I decide to purchase another LCD TV, I would purchase another Samsung of the LNT xx53 line.","Date":"June 23, 2007"}

It sounds like a defect to me.Also, changing channels on the TV tuner takes 2.5 seconds to go from channel 2 to channel 3.  That makes surfing the channels impossible, and makes the need for storing your favorites necessary (but storing to memory doesn't work, so I am out of luck).Picture quality is quite good.","Date":"June 15, 2007"}

I hesitated because I was waiting for more HD channels.  I also waited for the price point of $800, and then after reading more great reviews I decided to take the plunge. I'm using it in my bedroom, which it is perfect for. The picture was the best I've seen, bar none, but I was worried about the audio drop out problem, (see below in discussion forum).  However, Samsung seems to have  corrected this with the latest firmware.My experience with Amazon and the ordering process was flawless.  I ordered on a Monday, got an email 2 days later telling me Eagle would be contacting me for an appt. for delivery, they called on that Friday and delivered the next Monday.  The guy came when expected, plugged it in, all looked good, and I spent the next few hours going through the remote and fine tuning things.  i had bought an RCA OTA antenna ($49) for local HD free channels, but it only picked up one channel, so I returned it and bought a Phillips antenna at Walmart for $24, and it picks up all locals! Just auto program the channels for OTA. I don't have HDMI cable or HD through Directv yet, but plan to when the HD dvr drops a little in price.  In the meantime I checked my manufacture date, which was July 2007, and the firmware in my tv was 1012, the April update, so I contacted Samsung for the 1020 firmware, took 2 calls, but it was finally delivered, and easy to install.  This way I'll be ready for HDMI and HD dvr when I decide to order, with no audio drop out problems.  Rest assured, this tv is great, the colors and true to life images with my OTA antenna are breathtaking!  Other channels through my Tivo look ok. It's well worth the price and delivery, (which I worried about), was flawless.  I think my next purchase will be a 46\" Samsung for my den.","Date":"November 22, 2007"}

Far more flexibility here than in either the Sony or the Toshiba. The sound deserves particular note, as they manage to get really good audio (not the equivalent of seperate speakers, mind you) from the really unobtrusive built-in speakers. The supplied remote is a bit cluttered but then again, what remote to an HD set these days isn't?For $850 delivered, this TV is a steal (my Toshiba was $1000 about 10 months ago and my Sony was $3500 2 1/2 years ago!!!)

{"Title":"Everything I expected","Author":"Catbird \"Jerry\"","ReviewID":"RTEA3LOGQ3V0Z","Overall":"good","Content":"I have a nice wood cabinet, originally for a Heathkit TV, that I've tailored for many years to fit upgraded TVs. When I decided it was time to go high-def, I wondered what I could use to replace my 27\" Sony Trinatron. It looked like a 32\" wide-screen LCD would just fit the  cabinet. But which one? I went shopping and found that this Samsung was the only one that had on-set controls on the front; all others had them on the side. Since my cabinet would not give me access to the side, it was a no brainer. It has been a joy even since the set arrived. I hooked it up to an attic antenna before the HD cable was installed and I was able to get some great HD pictures with the built-in tuner. The picture in standard 3 x 4 format is about identical in size to that of my old 27\" set.","Date":"September 29, 2007"}

{"Title":"How I fixed the high pitched noise","Author":"KC","ReviewID":"R3FDFXG8JTYV9M","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a good television with great picture and many fine features but like so many others my set over time developed the annoying high frequency noise. After reading some of the reviews here and finding information elsewhere I found that the early sets had a defective component on the power control circuit board. I contacted Samsung regarding the issue but they did not acknowledge responsibiity for the defective component and my set was no longer under warranty. So I found a revised circuit board available at [...], part # BN44-00155A. The new board cost was [...].To replace the board I placed the set face down on my living room carpet. I removed the screws holding the back panel to the front. I easily located the PCB...the power cord is connected directly to it via a small cable...and pulled 3 or 4 attached cables. The cables appear to be relatively fragile so be careful with this step. I removed 4 screws that attached the PCB and reversed the process with the new board and back panel.I turned the set on and it has been operating noise free since. Another advantage is that it seems to have improved the picture quality to some extent. At first I thought it was just me but my girlfriend was the first to mention it. Samsung should have recalled these sets but since they didn't I was happy to salvage my initial investment for an additional $100. Hope this helps others having the same issue.","Date":"August 18, 2009"}

I had been researching an array of TVs and finally decided that LCD panels are the way to go.  At first I thought I'd spend only $400-500 on an Olevia since they tend to have pretty decent quality for a low price event though they are not a big name brand.  THEN... I came across the LN-T3253H at Fry's.  It was $1100 and on sale at $899+Tax = $1000.  I started researching the TV online and compared its features against other big name brands.  No other TV came close to having the same amazing features for the same price.  Others would have only about a 4000:1 contrast ratio and fewer inputs but would still cost about $1000+.  Finally, I found this beautiful TV for $879 at BestBuyPlasma.com.  This came without the addition of tax and with free shipping. BEST PRICE AROUND!After having this beauty for about 4 months now, I have not had a single problem... except when I first configured it with my computer. I looked up the best recommended picture settings and adjusted it accordingly.  It's only a 720p but the picture quality makes up for the lower resolution. The screen produces extremely bright and vivid colors.  I tested this by looking at 5MP pictures that I had taken down in the Caribbean.  I couldn't believe the details and color contrast that can be rendered.  Plenty of settings on this TV make it perfect for anyone. Since I am usually using it for the computer or watching TV at night I have the brightness turned all the way down, but when I watch the movie 300 I just press one button to switch over to my best picture setting.

Hausauer","ReviewID":"R2FBUG937SIS7J","Overall":"bad","Content":"I did my research and compared prices, and this definitely seemed like the best set for me.  And for the first 20 days or so, it was great.  The set-up was easy, the menus were clear and helpful, the colors were good, and the picture was sharp.  Then, in the course of one evening, the picture went bad.  Brightly lit scenes were almost impossible to see because the whites overwhelmed them, people's faces looked like they were lit from within, and there were color artifacts and extensive blurring in fast-moving scenes.Samsung has a NO REPLACEMENT policy -- they will only repair the set, even if that means replacing most or all of the electronic parts.  That would have been OK, if I could have gotten the TV fixed easily, but it was not to be.  On the first service visit, the technician replaced the main board and power supply, but that did not fix the problem.  Having already been without my TV for two weeks, I tried to expedite the part (screen and screen driver) needed for the second effort.The technician told me I had to call Samsung.  Samsung told me only the technician could place and expedite the order.  Finally, after asking to speak with a manager, the Samsung customer rep called the technician's company directly, and then assured me (on  Monday) that the part had been ordered and expedited, and that it would arrive with the technician no later than Friday morning.  (She also told me if the second repair did not fix my set, I would get a new one; but I never got as far as testing that.)The following Monday -- the first day I could get on the repair schedule -- I was told that the part not only had not been received, but had not been SHIPPED by Samsung.  When I called Samsung, I was told that my repair ticket had been CLOSED.  The customer rep opened a new one, but then told me that I would need to call back, as the service dept was too busy to talk with me immediately to figure out what had happened to the previous order.  When I asked to talk with a manager, I was told I would have to hold for 10-15 minutes.  When I asked to have a manger call ME, I was told that was just not possible.At this point, I called Amazon, and was told that they would refund my money and would also pay the cost of return shipping.  The most amazing part of the whole experience was that when I called Samsung back and told them I was going to return the TV and would never buy another Samsung product, the customer rep with whom I spoke displayed no apparent concern and made no effort to change my mind.  The same was true of the person who called later that day to ask how my repair went (presumably based on the erroneously closed ticket) and if I was satisfied.  This was in stark contrast to Amazon customer service reps, who clearly care whether customers have a good experience with the company.  Kudos to Amazon, and goodbye to Samsung.","Date":"January 21, 2008"}

Not an expert, but I made sure to do my homework and ended up with the Samsung 32\" 1080p LCD HDTV.PROS:1. Brand name. Samsung is a recognizable name, a Consumer Reports recommended buy, and not nearly as overpriced as Sony.2. LCD. LCDs have a better picture in brightly lit rooms. Avoid plasma if you have a lot of light.3. Cool case. Samsung has the coolest looking case, hands down. OK, I take that back. Sony XBR2 has the coolest looking case, but Samsung has the coolest looking AFFORDABLE case.4. Size. The 32\" has the best picture quality of all the larger TVs. Any larger on an LCD, and the picture for standard definition TV gets fuzzy. And at 32\", you don't look like you're compensating for anything.5. Lots of holes in back. You can plug everything you own into the back of this thing: DVI, HDMI, PC, and multiple sets of all the usual suspects. There's a set of holes hidden along the side, too, for easy access.CONS:1. Brand name. You pay a little more for Samsung than for a less recognized name that Consumer Reports says will perform just as well.2. LCD. In a darker room, plasma will have better contrast and deeper blacks. Tweak the picture settings on this TV, though, and you can have a satisfactory picture all day (and night) long.3. Cool case. It's shiny. In a well lit room, that means it reflects light. Be mindful of how you position this TV in relation to your windows and lamps. You're best off having windows and lamps behind it or to the side, and not directly across from it. Otherwise, the reflections dancing along the case can be distracting during boring movies.4. Factory settings. Standard definition TV looks awful in the factory settings. You'll have to play with the brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc., to get a decent looking picture. \"Decent looking\" = comparable to ye olde tube TV, which I'm pleased to report LCD technology can now sufficiently mimic.NOTE:- I haven't watched anything in high definition on this TV. (No HD channels and no DVD player yet.) Looked purdy in the store display, though.- 1080p will be appreciated by picture snobs only. If you plan to mainly watch standard definition TV, 720p and 1080p will look exactly the same. You will only notice a difference in HD, and only if you're sensitive to a high definition picture. (If you were happy with your tube TV and don't need anything better than that, stick to 720p. It will still outperform your needs.)Overall, I'm happy with it. My fiance is a picture snob, and he's happy with it, too.","Date":"August 31, 2007"}

I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26\" Samsung.  Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed.  It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions.  It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit.  Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available.  Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane.  Returned it and bought a 32\" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more.  Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing.

For set-up I've just got the cable plugged directly into the TV, so I just get the network HD channels (our cable company's HD line-up isn't worth the extra $ to get it yet).  The non-HD channels are disappointing and I think my old TV set actually had a better picture.  This is my first HDTV, so I can't say if all non-HD channels look as poor via an HDTV or if it's this particular model.  The HD channels though are excellent.  One downside I've noticed though is if a channel is in 1080i the picture will break up a bit with fast moving action - this doesn't happen with the 720p channels.  With a lot of HD channels I'd rate this 4 stars, but with mixed viewing HD and non-HD it's 3 stars.","Date":"December 10, 2007"}

It has continued to get worse throughout the years.  The picture is fine and the TV has survived through several moves (with use of the original box and moving it myself instead of allowing the movers to handle it), but that whistle is annoying and embarrassing when having company over.  It is at such a pitch that I don't always notice it, but I have also gotten used to tuning it out.  I have had comments from friends that aren't used to it though.  I would LOVE the TV if it weren't for that.","Date":"July 21, 2013"}

In June 2008, it began making a high-pitched buzzing sound that was most obvious when on mute. I called Samsung customer service, and they sent a local repair person a week later who replaced the SMPS coil (power board). It is now December 2011, and I have never had any other problems with the TV--knock, knock!I was lucky to get one with a sturdy swivel stand.  I LOVE the swivel stand, and the TV is not wobbly at all.  Unless you place this TV on the floor and have a huge dog with a huge wagging tail or unruly brats running around, I'm not sure why the TV would wobble because of the swivel stand.  It's not only convenient to swivel it to a desired viewing angle, but it's also helpful to swivel it when using the connections/ports in the back of the TV.  In fact, I'd like to find another Samsung with a swivel stand, but now they're hard to find.","Date":"December 10, 2011"}

The picture remains sharp, clear and correctly colored.Mine had the annoying hissing / whining / squeal noise when it was new. After the Power Supply board was replaced it's been great.The set turns on quickly, has a very good picture for a 720  resolution TV, a great remote and automatically finds and switches to Anynet/CEC compatible DVD / BluRay players.The sound is decent for an LCD TV.  It's weak on Bass which is most noticeable when watching movies.Recently, I went shopping for a larger TV. I was shocked to find that now, in 2010 the LN-T3253 from 2007 still has a better picture than many new TV sets particularly when viewing fast moving scenes or SD content.  The only new TV sets that equalled or surpassed its picture cost as much or more than this one did.That said, compared to a 1080 resolution TV the picture is grainy and BlueRay offers no noticeable improvement over DVD.If you come across one of these in used condition, it's probably worth buying so long as it has had the squeal/hiss problem corrected.Enjoy,Keri","Date":"June 12, 2010"}

After 17 months, the picture died.  The set would still turn on and I could hear the audio, but no picture whatsoever.  I got it fixed at a cost of $294 (new motherboard needed).  Fortunately, VISA paid for the repair, under their free one-year extended warranty provision (check with your credit card issuer to see if it's a feature of your particular issuer).This TV will display a great picture with HD content, but for whatever reason, the video from my 480i/p DVD player (a Sony) looked terrible.  The sound is merely ok.  The design and finish is outstanding; this TV looks great just sitting there.  I'm hoping I can get many more years out of it without any more repair issues, but it's discouraging to see that so many owners have had issues with this set.","Date":"March 12, 2010"}

While it's a wonderful tv if you can't hear the whistling coming from the it (which is why I gave this tv two stars instead of one), the whistling is enough to make me say it was DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PURCHASE.It's fantastic to watch for the first 20 minutes to a half hour, but then the high-pitched whistling becomes unbearable until you shut the tv off.

{"Title":"A High Quality Product.","Author":"1776","ReviewID":"R2E1CQ7P28XBG9","Overall":"good","Content":"We've had this set for about a year and a half now and we really enjoy it.  My only real regret is not getting a bigger screen, but my wife didn't want a set too large for our smallish living room.  However, she was pleasantly surprised at how nice this \"piano black\" Samsung looked there and we both just love watching TV on it, expecially in HD.  Even the remote looks and feels stylish.My one criticism is with the 2 zoom modes.  \"Zoom 1\" should back off just a little...it cuts off a little more than it needs to to optimize a wide-screen standard def picture.  \"Zoom 2\" is completely useless.BTW, as far as I can tell this set does not do 1080i, just 720p.  This has not been an issue thus far, as all HD programming we get is 720p, but there will be a BluRay player in its future, which does 1080p and it would be nice to know we're getting the highest res picture there is...but again, this matters less on a smaller TV like this.For the 8 feet average distance from our couch to the set, I think a 42 inch would be perfect, so I've started poking around at the latest Sharp Aquos 42\", and for not much more than the $900 or so we paid for this, you get a 10 inch bigger screen, 1080p, twice as fast response time and slightly better contrast ratio in a fairly compact package.  This would bump the Sharp into a smaller room in the house which would work better for a 32\".","Date":"December 5, 2008"}

Time enough to have played around with the myriad picture adjustments that the set offers.

(I live in a major metropolitan area and up ten stories, the limit by law in our fair city...HD over-the-air is moving right along.) Time enough to see that its native 720p resolution is plenty for an LCDTV of this size. Time enough to know that if I were an actor I would hate HD as it enables viewers to count nose hairs. (thirty-eight in the right and forty-two in the left Barak! No... YOUR left.)NOT time enough to know if the sound drop-outs and the bad power unit problems that have been well documented here and on Cnet, a site I use a lot, will affect me, (Both problems have quick fixes under warranty.)I should mention that I am not a gamer.

Rognlien","ReviewID":"R2ZBL8IH8DORUJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this TV from Amazon last August and, it being my first LCD, instantly loved it.  I'm not as technical as many of the reviewers on here but from a layperson's perspective, here's what I liked:1.  As with all Samsung products, you get a really good quality TV for a really competitive price.  Many of the comparable TV's I looked at were 150-200 more for the same essential features.2.  1080p is really REALLY clear, but you need an upconverting DVD player to really capture the full effect.  You can find them online for under $100, and Amazon is even giving them away (as of today) with purchase.3.  As other reviewers have noted, the picture quality is noticeably lower on non-HD channels, but I don't think it's the TV itself, I think it's just a general HD/non-HD comparison that you normally don't get all within the same set.  My recommendation is to not watch the TV from ~10 feet or less and you won't notice much difference.About 3 weeks after I purchased this TV from Amazon, I noticed a solid (thin) bar which appeared to be dead cells (or whatever they're called).  I called Samsung, they sent out a technician 2 days later and replaced the screen at no charge within a week.  So, for anyone who thinks that they'll be missing service quality should something go wrong, my experience showed me that my concerns were unfounded.","Date":"March 27, 2008"}

There is a loud buzzing sound that comes from the TV. Called Amazon. This TV goes back. I have learned my lesson with Samsung TV's. Check out the discussion forum regarding this TV. There is a rather large post regarding problems with the power supply with this TV. Lesson learned. Check the discussion forums.UPDATE: February 18, 2008. Called Amazon & ordered a Toshiba. I am waiting for delivery and was still putting up with the high pitched whistle. Now the lcd went bad and displays a jumbled picture. Read the discussion forum and avoid this TV.

First let me say Amazon came through big time for us in the customer service department. They replaced not one but TWO defective units, no questions asked. Thank you Amazon! The good: great picture, great sound easy to set up. The bad: both units had the same problem that developed after  a couple of weeks of light use. After being on for an hour or so the units would start to emit a high frequency whine. We tried everything to isolate the problem, all to no avail. The problem was in the TV. Samsung support and warranty was of no help, they had not a clue as to what was causing it, or at least that's what they said. The longer the unit was used the louder the whine would become. Some research on Google turned up references to this problem with several different manufactures,(common components?) not just Samsung. Some tech sites said it had something to do with high voltage transformers inside the TV overheating. Whatever the problem is we ended up sending both units back and moved on to a Sharp. Thanks again Amazon for the high level of support! It was a hassle but certainly not Amazon's fault.","Date":"February 13, 2008"}

Polanski \"CJP\"","ReviewID":"R3BR8RJODEPQY0","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had this TV set up in my bedroom for about two weeks when I began to get the dreaded audio dropout issue. Until that point my fingers were crossed as everything else about the TV was great. Picture quality, the many features, and even the speakers were great. It is absolutely breathtaking with HD content. As soon as the audio cut out a few times, it was back to the store and not with another Samsung given their horrible record of customer service. It was still within my return period, so I didn't want to hesitate given the similar problems faced by so many others.If you have the patience to deal with Samsung or other places for repairs, then I would say keep it. I personally think that it is ridiculous to need to have a 14 day old, $1000 TV repaired. Too bad, because everything else about the set is great. Maybe I'm being to picky, but when I spend that much money on a television I believe it should be flawless.","Date":"February 9, 2008"}

Reilly","ReviewID":"RU72CTL019RUJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I won't give you a real technical in depth talk, there are other much smarter people than me for that.  I bought this TV because it was the best rated 32\" on CNET, I couldn't be happier with the choice.  The screen looks beautiful, it has plenty of inputs, and the speakers are amazing!  My roommate is a sound engineer by degree, he agrees that the sound out of this TV is top notch, and you can't even see them!  no seriously, I've looked all over the sides and bottom and back and I can't find them.  There's some holes on the bottom, I think they might be there, and then the sound is reflected forward by that clear plastic strip along the bottom, but I'm really not sure.  We have Comcast HD, a wii, a PS3, PS2, and a laptop all plugged in at once.  My only complaint is that you can't have PIP with two digital sources at the same time, and if you do have an analog PIP with digital, the sound will only come from the digital source.  I actually don't think this is possible yet with any TV, as I don't think the processing power is there to decode two digital signals at once (I'm not positive on this though).Anyway, if you're looking for near-top-of-the-line technology for a reasonable price in this size, this is the one to get.  In this size, there really is no reason to get a 1080p (the Aquos is the only 1080p in this size).  I'm in the Air Force and have perfect vision, and from more than about 5 feet back I can't tell the difference.Also, the glowing blue light at the bottom is really cool...","Date":"February 9, 2008"}

In contrast, my little 20\" Vizio HDTV finds all the available HD channels with its QAM tuner without any problem. I had to return the Samsung to Amazon because of the QAM tuner problem.

Then one night the audio must have cutout 500 times during a two hour period. But the audio has been just fine in the last week so I'm not sure if it is the TV or the HDTV cable signal.This has been a well known issue with these TV's when using the HDMI port. I contacted Samsung's customer service dept. and must say I am really disappointed with them. Contacted them over a week ago and still no new reply. If the audio problem is either ok or fixed I would give this TV a solid 4 stars. I think it is in the top 3 as far as 32\" sets go from what I've seen of them. This was my first major purchase off of Amazon and so far it has been good dealing with them. UPDATE- Samsung sent a local repair shop to my home and they ended up replacing the main board in the set and brought the set back to me a day later.He told me there was  a sound problem and it should be ok now.

Has an integrated HDTV tuner and all the connections you will need.  Looks sweet, too.  However, I got one off Amazon which was a dud.  Poor picture quality and white light bleed from the top and bottom of the screen (a problem another customer complained about).  Samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective.  Amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund.  Be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback.  Oh, one annoying feature.  While the HDTV tuner works well, you cannot dial in a specific digital channel (like 10.1) unless the search program has previously found it.  And there is no way to \"save\" the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae, search for signals again, and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory.  In other words, if your search found 10.1 in one antenna position but not 6.1, there is no way the TV will let you dial in 6.1 even if you reposition the antenna optimally.  You must then reprogram the search to find 6.1, but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in 10.1 after turning antenna back because the TV did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search.

I have had it replaced twice under warranty for the white haze around the peremiter of the picture that you may have read about. All three of these have the same problem. I was told by Samsung that \"Our own Engineers have confirmed unit is within manufacturing specifications and is not defective.\" Kind of like when you buy a new house and you can see the seams in the drywall, and the builder tells you, \"we won't fix it, it's built to code\".Upon further research you will find this haze, for which the technical term is \"mura\" and also called \"clouding\" is a systemic problem with both Samsung and Sony. If you google \"Samsung mura\" you will find 145000 pages refering to the problem. If you google \"Sony Mura\" you get 304000 pages.

Lee \"wannabe tech geek\"","ReviewID":"RY9PFMEPVMCKP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this version for the HDMI port because my previous 19 inch Samsung didn't. When I started setting it up, I noticed a white blurry light bleeding from the edges. I didn't know what it was but I thought as I continued the setup, I could make adjustments to get rid of it. But I didn't find anything. The picture quality for this wasn't what I expected either, my old Samsung had very crisp images, this had a very noticable graininess to it. It was like that with my Xbox360 for both games and DVD. The PC connection wasn't any better. No matter how I messed with the settings for both TV and computer, I couldn't get a fine, clear image. I think I'll look for a bigger version. Pity, I had such high hopes for this one.","Date":"April 25, 2008"}

Ruggiero","ReviewID":"R20EMUAXC22QM4","Overall":"bad","Content":"Unlike other reviews I found the picture quality to be above average; not outstanding or decent but above average. My main problem with this good looking TV is the sound quality. The Samsung makers put all their focus and efforts into the sleek look and design along with picture quality but overlooked the second most important feature of any television - the AUDIO! I put both the TV remote and Cable remote on full blast and it still wasn't loud enough and I'm not hearing impaired or hard-of-hearing. I'm also not an audiophile either. The idiots at Samsung also put the tiny speaker in the top rear of the TV rather than the front where it counts the most! I don't know what they were thinking but I hope all of their TVs aren't made like this one...as this is my first Samsung and I was sold by the sleek design and picture quality on display at the store.The other minor details I have with this poorly made product (which I'm surprised no one else mentioned) aside from taking some time to turn on is the annoying sound it makes every time you turn it on and off. Also, when you put on the MUTE you have the annoying words moving up and down the bottom left-hand side of your screen...if you're watching a movie in mute you're eyes are glued on those moving words...almost hypnotized by them...no joke!So overall, beautiful exterior design, great picture and but poor sound.","Date":"July 13, 2008"}

On the other hand, the image is just awful. White will shear and bleed at a higher contrast ratio. The high and low lights are also wrong (blue high/low lights). The sound is not great but good for the size of the speakers. Obviously, when there is movement the focus goes way off (common in all LCD, Plasma and DLP) and the image looks even more awful. You can also see the smear(lag,trail) when there is fast movement ( caused by slow LCD response time in the miliseconds). In the end, I have seen 1986 RCA 14\" TV's who had a better image quality. Mitsubishi 37\" TV 1992 beats this TV by about 10 times and has a response time in the nanoseconds. End of line, this LCD TV has a very poor image quality. I give it 1 star since the menus and remote are very easy to use and the TV has a very compact design.","Date":"November 14, 2007"}

Once we got home & tried it on, we saw how awful the picture was. We have digital cable & unfortunately, our cable company has very few HD channels right now. We did the research & found out that in our area, the Dish Network has the most HD channels/programming available. If you have a game system that's not HD compatible like the PS3, u will get the same awful picture. There were also blue lights on the top edge of the TV. As soon as we saw that, we knew that TV was defective. We took it back to Best Buy & exchanged it hoping this next one would look better. Well, this one didn't have the blue lights on top, but it had white clouding/lights all around the TV's edges...very distracting. We will be returning this TV back to Best Buy again & getting a TV that works well with standard definition game systems such as the V-Smile, Leapster, etc. & regular cable programming.So, bottom line...to get the same wonderful picture u see at a store, u need to have EVERYTHING HD compatible. If u have digital cable & no HD channels or programming, this will NOT work for you & will be a waste of time & $...not to mention all the stress & frustration u will get.","Date":"January 24, 2008"}

Unfortunately ALL the 26 inch Samsung sets make this high pitch noise.  You will be in for a difficult time if you think it is not an issue because you do not hear the noise or think it does not bother you.  Many years ago when in college taking electronics a professor told us of how a student once connected a small speaker to the frequency generator that were on everyone's shop bench in the classroom.  It would then produce a high pitch noise (similar to the one all these Samsung sets make) and no one would even hear it.  After a few minutes though, people would start to feel uncomfortable and irritable.  The high pitched noise IS very discomforting even if you do not hear it.  When the professor saw everyone starting to loose attention and moving uncomfortably, he asked who the wise guy was and the guilty one laughed and turned off the noise.  Unfortunately with this Samsung LCD TV you can not turn off the noise and you will feel uncomfortable being exposed to it anytime the set is on.  I returned my Samsung set to Amazon that fortunately has a great return policy.  One prior reviewer stated that shopping malls are using high frequency noise to help limit teenagers from staying too long in parts of the shopping mall.  Another went through 3 Samsung 26 inch TV sets which all made the high pitch noise before giving up.  I like many really liked the TV set but realized the noise would not go away and WOULD make anyone in the room uncomfortable even if they did not hear it.","Date":"August 20, 2007"}

Just a few weeks over the time limit to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement. Then the high pitched sound started. Once the tv was on for an hour or two it would develope a high pitched whine coming from the back of the set and continued the whole time the set was on.  I contacted Samsung and they had me send it to NJ for repairs. Well, I got the set back from NJ today (after almost 3 weeks) and it doesn't even look like the same set. When I sent it in for repair I sent it in the original box with all original packing and it arrived today in a different box with different packing. My brand new tv (barely 3 months old) that left here without a mark or scratch on it, was covered in scratches, back and front.Further unpacking revealed a 1\" diameter hole in the front left corner that was broken out of the set along with pieces of plasitc that just fell out of the packing. I was also completely missing the oval base plate that I originaly sent.  I contacted Samsung again and they said to return it once again to the repair shop in NJ to see what they had to say about it ? So much for Samsung's warranty and customer service, it's beginning to look like I'm out almost $700.00 for a beat up, broken, missing parts tv. It's really a shame too because before the noise started up and I had to send it in for repairs it was a nice tv and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.

{"Title":"Screen Burn In Not Covered By Warranty","Author":"Working Mom","ReviewID":"R1XSO69URQ77D6","Overall":"bad","Content":"Our Samsung soon developed a thin vertical line at the edge of where the picture would be in 4:3 aspect ratio, i.e. it is only visible when viewing the picture at a wider aspect.  When I checked with Samsung, I discovered on their FAQ that their LCD TVs are subject to screen burn in:  \"In general, you should avoid keeping a static picture (that is, a picture that contains no or few moving elements) or a picture with static elements (black bars, black borders, logos, etc.) on your LCD TV for more than two hours at a time. If, for example, you have your TV set to 4:3, and have black borders on the top and bottom, or on the sides, changing the picture size for a minute or two every couple of hours, say during commercials or in between shows, would decrease the chance of screen burn in. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the screen when it is displaying static elements will also decrease the chance of burn in.\" So watching a long movie without changing the aspect ratio is enough to cause burn-in.

But when I received the first LCD TV, while watching my TV I heard a whistling/buzz (like a kettle) sound in the background of the programs I was watching and realized it was coming from the TV. I called and went to CC and Srs. (the main stores selling this same product and they hadn't had any returns nor heard anything about this product)They claimed this TV to be the top of the line product.My attempt to refine the problem further, I took advice and unhooked everything and just plugged it into different outlet of my house of differnt rooms and it continued to make the noise.  I hooked it up to my main TV watching room cable outlet and still no change in the conclusion that it was coming from the TV.  I called Samsung and they told me they have heard about this problem with there DLP TV that contain a colorwheel, but this product doesn't  contain a colorwheel. Samsung looked into it further and said it may be a defective powersaver (not sure what that is.)They were also vague with letting me know if there were many similar calls with this problem.  I returned the TV back to amazon (amazing customer service) and exchanged it for another one, thinking I had bad luck because I hear nothing but good news about this TV. I received it the next day this TV also made a  buzzing sound which was even louder.  Is it possible I'm just having bad luck and received 2 TVs that had the same problem?  Quite possible. So I returned it.(First TV received on May 17th and returned both TVs on May 29th.)I currently don't have a TV in my bedroom but I do think I will purchase the exact same one but this time from a store (more expensive) to rule out weather it was bad luck and if the same problem occurs again I can have more hands on help in discovering the problem.I loved the look of the TV, and the picture quality.  The only downfalls is that it takes a while to turn on and it does collect very noticeable dust.Those out there that have this TV, go up to your TV and listen closely (I can here the noise up to 15 feet away, the distance from my bed to the TV)and that goes the same for the new purchasers of this TV.","Date":"June 1, 2007"}

{"Title":"Malfunctioning, Repair process difficult","Author":"N. Porras \"fio_maravilha\"","ReviewID":"R3D6M8K7E40QJ0","Overall":"bad","Content":"My Sharp Aquos LC32D62U was purchased through one of Amazon's sellers, and they dont accept returns on TV's. So I'm stuck trying to get my defective set fixed by Sharp. The set worked for about 1 day (looked great by the way), but then failed (1/2\" wide black line across screen and rest of screen blurry and with double image).Called Sharp 3 days ago to get it repaired. They said to wait 2 days for service center to call me. They never did. Called service center and they said Sharp never contacted them. Called Sharp and was told dispatch center closes early on Fridays. Told to wait 'til Monday to start from the beginning. So I'll be lucky if I get a call from the service center one week after my first call to Sharp. Lets see when they actually show up, and when my set actually gets fixed. I guess that is the risk you take when buying a TV set online. Buyer Beware... you may have a huge headache on your hands even though you spent over $1K on a TV.","Date":"January 4, 2008"}
{"Title":"Image quality issues. At least 6th Ave gave me a refund.","Author":"Machina","ReviewID":"R3GCE9W9U5M22J","Overall":"bad","Content":"This TV arrived and it did look nice. But I have to say that a glossy frame is very impractical, and just plain stupid. Here's why:On the same day the TV arrived, dust started to accumulate on the glossy frame. It makes the TV look like it was in a bad wash job out of a dishwasher. And when you try to wipe the dust off, you get streaks everywhere. The tiny dust particles scratch it; and there is NOTHING you can do about it.Now let's get to the image quality. For some reason, this 1080p display appears to not show anything progressive. The TV said it was receiving 1080p, but I still noticed lines that looked like scan lines. Scan lines in 1080i looked only slightly worse when playing a movie. Playing 1080p PS3 games showed that there is a significant visual difference between 1080p and 1080i: much more aliasing everywhere.I was able to tell when I was watching First Blood on Blu-Ray. Then I started seeing it everywhere. It's also easy to spot if I get close to the TV and move my head up and down. I was very disappointed. I wasn't too upset about the three or four dead pixels that I got, but this got me upset.So because I wasn't sure if this flaw was a characteristic of the display, I sent it back and got a Sony 32S3000. They are both the same price, but I'm downgrading in resolution to 720p. I was nervous about downgrading the resolution, but I was surprised at how much it wasn't an issue.","Date":"February 25, 2008"}

It has had the sound board replaced twice as of this writing. The first time the sound board malfunctioned the television was 2 months out of warranty and cost me $325 to repair. I contacted Sharp and they told that there was nothing they could do as the set was out of warranty. While not happy with the explanation I realized that was truly the case and absorbed the cost.  The sound board failed four months later. I contacted Sharp and pleaded my case and was told there was nothing they would do. I was told by the local designated Sharp repair service center to call Sharp again and ask to speak to another supervisor. I had now spoken to both supervisors about the matter, and after lengthy waits on hold both times, that that they would not speak to me.  I went ahead and had the set repaired. The cost was another $325. I was told that there had been issues with the sound in this model and that they had changed the manufacture of this particular sound board. I now have the new version of the sound board.  If Sharp knew that there were issues with this particular component I strongly feel that they should reimburse me if not the entire cost of both repairs surely the second repair.

When we plugged itin, the sound no longer worked. The company again took it away, this timein the back of a car. I called customer service and when they tried toreach the repair center, their number was discounted.A week later the TV came back - The sound still did not work. I kept theTV and decided to take my chances with the corporate customer servicegroup.

Ivry","ReviewID":"R2YM65AD80U5Y2","Overall":"bad","Content":"Absolutely my worst experience with TV's - ever.  Sure, the picture is generally great, but too many problems and too many service calls. I got sucked in based on the glowing reviews and paid dearly for my mistake. My HPT5064 is barely 14 months old and the power supply board needs replacement!!! Of course it went just after the warranty had expired. No surge, no brownout - just gone. I called Samsung when it went dark and they kindly advised their factory authorized company, which was to contact me to schedule the appointment. Well, 3 days later I get a call informing me that a technician will be there in 5 days. Count that: we're up to 8 days. The guy shows up, tests the unit and promptly informs me that I need a new power supply board. Total estimate: $360 plus tax.  So here I am, faced with the attractive option of investing almost $400 in a unit which has already given me multiple audio and picture ghosting problems and which has never worked with HDMI. Why bother -- I decided to cut my losses, paid the guy his minimum $81 fee and will move on to a Sony, Pioneer or another reliable brand. Will sell this piece of junk to a refurbishing shop and will never look at another Samsung again.","Date":"February 10, 2009"}

However, the problem started right way. It would not turn on, and after waiting for an hour, it finally did turn on. My husband started getting suspicious that something was wrong, but Samsung cust svc stated that it might be because TV was still warming up. Well, after 2 weeks of normal use (just TV and video watching, not video games), it completely died and would not turn back on!I believe I got a defective product because TV is way too new to be having problems already. I returned it to Amazon and am waiting for a refund.The TV was awesome though. It has a 15,000:1 contrast ratio, thus producing very sharp and clear picture. Even though it is a 720p resolution, I honestly do not see the difference between this TV and the 1080p one. The minor drawback is the sound quality, but that can be overcome by surround speakers. I am buying another Samsung because I love the TV.The reason for the 2-star rating is due to the hassle of returning TV. I was told by Amazon cust svc that someone from Eagle/CEVA would contact me within 2-3 days to pick up the TV. After one week, still no word from them. I HAD TO CONTACT THEM, waited all morning for 4 hrs to talk to the \"correct\" person to schedule a pick up.I don't think I would buy a big ticket item from Amazon again.

Love the picture quality, and ease of use. Unfortunately about a year after we purchased it, every once in a while the sound would go out. You would have to turn the TV off, wait a few seconds, then turn it back on, and it would be fine. We have had it for almost 4 years now and last week it just randomly shut off, and started making a clicking noise like it was trying to turn back on. The only way to make it stop was to unplug it from the wall. we waited till the next day to try it again, and it came on for about 5 minutes and then once again shut off, and started making the clicking noise. I then looked for help on the Internet. I found a lot on the LCD version of this TV, that it had a bad capacitor, and that Samsung would replace it free of charge. I thought wow! that would be nice! Unfortunately, this TV is not LCD, it is Plasma. When i called Samsung, I was told that Plasma is not covered under the issue (even though it is the exact same issue). I was referred to local stores to have someone come out and repair it. After calling around and getting estimates, it looks like I'm going to be paying anywhere from $300-$500 to have it repaired. I realize the television IS 4 years old, but it should not have a issue like this. You would think since there are so many people with this same issue that Samsung would care a bit more.

Spend the extra money on some other company like Sony, I know I wish I did.When it did work, picture was nice and 1080P. The detection system was nice when it worked but you can't choose it yourself. And that's where the problem comes in. It comes with 4 HDMI ports, 2 Component Ports, 1 VGA, and a couple others like the standard Red-Yellow-White hook up.Unfortunatly those 4 HDMI ports worked on and off. I called Westinghouse and their suggestion was to unplug the 42in TV so that it would reset itself. It worked on occassion but this shouldn't be an issue in the first place. Try plugging in more than 1 HDMI cable and the TV gets confused and back to square one with unplugging.Things currently plugged into it:1) Cable2) Component 1 - Wii3) Component 2 - Cable for HD channels4) HDMI 1 - Xbox 3605) HDMI 2 - Upcoverter HD DVD playerI wish Bestbuy offered me their protection plan.

{"Title":"Buyer beware of HDTVs made by Westinghouse Digital!!!!","Author":"ASM \"amatrex\"","ReviewID":"RGVSFTU7X54WD","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this model from Best Buy in May 2008 along with a 3-year extended warranty.  The unit worked fine up until the summer of 2010.  That's about the time I began to notice burn-in/image retention on my screen, which included faint outlines/shadows of network logos (ESPN), scoreboards, and PS3 game images.  I tried every method under the sun to rid my TV screen of the burn-in (including DVDs of black and white images, powering the TV off for days, and keeping it on a snowy image for hours at a time), but no luck.  So I contacted Best Buy, and they dispatched a local HDTV technician to my apartment to confirm that my unit had burn-in; unfortunately Best Buy stated that my extended warranty does NOT cover burn-in.  They argued that the 3-year Best Buy warranty is a reflection and extension of the 1-year Westinghouse manufacturer's warranty, so they would only cover what Westinghouse Digital covers in their warranty.  I then contacted Westinghouse about the issue, and they stated that they do not cover burn-in because they believe LCDs (at least not their brand) do not incur burn-in and if mine did, then it was \"customer induced\" meaning it was MY fault.Westinghoue Digital's reasoning for not covering burn-in is hogwash because I did nothing abnormal to my TV in the 2 years that I had it, so the burn-in was not my fault.  They wouldn't even consider the idea that my unit was poorly made or defective, and they refused to replace or repair my HDTV after months of battling with them.  So now I'm stuck with an HDTV that has image retention and a 3-year extended warranty ($150) that has been pretty much useless.Needless to say, I will NEVER, EVER purchase an HDTV or any other product from Westinghouse Digital, and I would advise anyone else to be leery of doing the same.  Oh yeah, their customer service is pretty terrible too because they almost never get back to you in a prompt manner unless it's with an auto-generated email that says \"we'll get back to you in 1-2 business days.\"  Westinghouse Digital is a joke.","Date":"January 31, 2011"}

At the time it was one of the newest models and was $1100. I compared it to several other TVs they had on sale and finally took this thing home. It was easy to set up and easy to use. The picture was great and games played nicely on it.The problem came about 6 months later when the NO INPUT burned into the screen. I tried to white it out by hooking the TV up to the PC and leaving a white screen on and a black one for several hours a day. This did reduce the image but never rid the set of it.Now here it is almost 4 years later and the TV is still working. The picture is still great when watching movies and playing games. However, it is starting to 'hold' images. You will see your HUD from games still on the screen when you go back to the menu or you will see NETFLIX still on the screen as your movie starts. This doesn't bother me so much b/c it doesn't last long.The HDMI ports will decide on their own to stop working. I will turn the tv on and then the PS3/360/PC and will hear the sound out of the stereo system but nothing on the screen. It is an easy fix to just hold down the power button on the TV to reset the HDMIs and it is back to normal.When all is said and done I just expect more out of my $1100, for that matter $500. I shouldn't have to reset the TV or deal with a burned image. Next time I am going to go with a name brand and probably the model from the year before so I can read a years worth of reviews.All in all get this TV if you can find it for under $400 otherwise there are too many bargain TVs now to waste your money on this.","Date":"March 20, 2011"}

While this set has 5 HDMI ports they are all on the same hub.  So, you cannot your program to go to a specific HDMI port.  If you want to use a Logitech Harmony or similar programmable remote this is a deal killer.  I ended up buying an HDMI switcher, which resulted me in spending all of the money I spent.2. When switching between SD and HD programming this set takes 5 full seconds to display the picture.  Your wife will hate that.3.

Easy to set up and to use with all my different components (dvd, vcr, sound system, cablebox).However, six months later, I have been having some horrible problems with it. It scrambles and has some horrible color problems (whites are showing up pink and blown out details). I started calling Westinghouse after the first of the year and got the run around. I had the cable company out to check the signal, switched out 2 cable boxes, and did the factory reset a couple of hundred times. It took calling every week for a month to get them working on this. Finally, I was able to get them to send me a box and now its been sitting with them to make whatever decision they are going to make.Although this may have been a rare problem with my particular tv, I feel the way in which it was being dealt with was inexcusable.

Unfortunately, my problems are sporadic and, not noticing them when viewing cable television, I assumed that this problem was caused by the other input source I used on it (a video game console).  I had that unit serviced twice, and by the time I realized that the problem was with the television and not the input source, the unit was out of warranty by about 3 months.  Despite having documentation to show that my problems began only a few months after buying their product, their customer disservice department basically told me I was up poop creek.  I guess it was crazy of me to expect a $600 television to work properly for a whole year and a half.  Thanks for nothing, Westinghouse!

Sometimes, these just represent one single data point, and aren't that relevant. My experience, however, leads me to believe that Westinghouse KNOWS that this television is very prone to failure, and I hope others will appreciate hearing about it.I bought this item on sale and got a great deal, and for six months it worked brilliantly. Then, it simply stopped coming on. Westinghouse's warranty service first sent me to a local repair shop, which was unable to fix the tv because Westinghouse, unlike ANY OTHER MANUFACTURER, does not directly sell parts, even to THEIR OWN LICENSED WARRANTY REPAIR TECHS. I then had to ship the TV back to Westinghouse AT MY OWN EXPENSE (one fourth the cost of the TV!) and have been waiting over four weeks for them to do anything with it. They tell me that this model is so prone to failure that they do not have the inventory to replace them!Had I just spent the money I have now spent on shipping I could have gotten a higher quality TV, or even a larger one. That is what I suggest you do. This television WILL FAIL.

I think it may have even been on sale so we really got a deal... or so we thought.

Sometimes it would turn on and then immediately shut itself off.2. A black line developed down the length of the screen. This was not burn-in from watching standard aspect ratio as the line was more toward the center. Eventually the line went away.Then, after about a year of use (conveniently after the warantee ran out), the tv started blooming - white backgrounds developed a bluish-tint. The tv would self-correct after a while, but we are now at the point where it's a constant problem and the picture is practically unwatchable.We have checked everything - the video game components, cable box, dvd player, etc. We have replaced cords and adjusted color/brightness/sharpness levels.

Then within a month ago it started changing the channel.  I didn't think a thing of it, I assumed that the DVD player wasn't plugged in as firmly as it should be, and it only did it while it was paused.  Then one day I was watching it and suddenly the screen went blank.  This was still around the same time as the other, so again, I didn't think a whole lot of it, it only happened the one time and by changing the channel and back again it worked fine.  Then within the last few days I noticed a horrible smell in my room.  I had my kids with me helping me look for the source of the smell, I thought maybe they had spilled something like pipe cleaner or something from my husband's toolbox.  The smell was exclusively upstairs and clearly by my bedroom.  The smell finally went away, with a lot of gagging on my part and I didn't think of it until later when I complained to my husband, by now I figured that the air conditioner had lost it's freon.  Which he told me was impossible since it doesn't hold that much and it was still getting cold.  That night, when I went to go to bed, where my husband was watching TV, the smell was back.  I complained to him but he told me I was nuts that he couldn't smell anything.  I put up with the smell, again gagging and still didn't get the connection.  Within a day or so the picture started going out, though I thought that the cords weren't plugged in right.  Last night my husband worked it over and we couldn't get the picture back for more than 10 seconds.  We had to bring a different TV from downstairs.  I loved this TV and to make a long story short, don't waste your money, it can't be repaired and you are stuck with a big paperweight that makes you mad when you look at it.  Now we have taken the kids' TV they use for their Wii until we can save up to buy another TV for our room, which is the only place we watch.  Very disappointed and I can promise I won't waste any more money on another Westinghouse.  They used to be a brand name that you can trust, clearly this isn't the case anymore.

Kelley \"Colonel Kelley, CSA\"","ReviewID":"R2CCG9SAKD390M","Overall":"bad","Content":"The first set I bought had the graphical interface menus and could display 4:3 source material properly via HDMI but arrived with image jitter that took only five minutes to manifest itself.When the first set was replaced (at my expense for $50 shipping) I got the \"latest firmware\" with crude text menus and no ability to display 4:3 source material via HDMI without the TV stretching the image.  I tested all TV menu functions with five different brands of DVD players (including a Toshiba HD-DVD player and a Samsung dual-format HD player) and all possible player setting combinations with no luck overcoming this issue.The TV was returned (again at my $50 expense) and replaced with another unit with EXACTLY the same image-stretching issue.  Multiple calls to Westinghouse Support (you cannot talk to anyone from the real technical side) and another replacement (this time shipping at W'house expense) and I got another \"certified refurbished\" set that had the same image-stretching issue but also experienced catastrophic failure within 15 minutes of first use.Via email I finally got W'house Support to admit that the set CANNOT display 4:3 source material via HDMI without stretching it because, \"The TV is functioning in the way that the software programmers designed it to function.  HDMI is a high definition input source, and is designed to be used with high definition output devices.  The native format for almost all HD programming is 16:9, which is native aspect ratio for the LCD screen.\"When I pointed out that HD DVD players DO play standard resolution DVDs with upscaling and that LOTS of programming (several Star Trek series and other TV series included) is available ONLY in 4:3 format I got no further replies.Is someone in W'house living in a cave?Bottom line is that the \"updated\" firmware was rewritten to resolve two \"issues\" and had a fallout of intelligence.  I was told that, \"Consumers didn't like the graphical controls and strongly requested plain text (suuuure) and that the auto-detect/auto-on feature was turning the set on in the middle of the night for some satellite service subscribers (not my DirecTV)\" - but they also made the brilliant decision to make it impossible to watch 4:3 DVD programming in its proper format via HDMI input.I have not tested it yet with my DirecTV HD connection (since I am without a TV for the fourth time), but I am wiling to bet that it cannot properly display any of the 4:3 source programming broadcast at times on the HD channels.I have had some very nice Customer Support folks try to help me and I cannot fault their courtesy - but as someone who started working with computers in 1971, spent 10 years as a Navy Airborne Electronic Warfare Officer and documented software development their tech side falls woefully short.Since buying the first set I have had almost no use of the product because multiple sets have either been enroute to or from W'house and EACH TIME the exchange takes palce W'house gives itself up to 21 days for an exchange.  Multiply 4 x 21 and add 10 days each time for shipping both ways - that means since MAY the set has been traveling or being exchanged for a total of 124 days - over four months - almost 60% of the time since I bought it - NOT hanging from my wall being watched.My recommendation is that NO ONE buy any Westinghouse LCD TV unless and until you can test and ensure that the set is capable of accurately displaying 4:3 sources via HDMI without stretching.  Maybe some models have escaped the oversight of the \"software programmers\" who evidently do not test their programming to see if it applies in the real world.W'house shows no interest in resolving this issue or even discussing it intelligently, stopping communication when the error in firmware was identified.Bottom line is - DO NOT BUY WESTINGHOUSE.","Date":"December 16, 2008"}

The quality of this TV for an entry level 32 inch LCD is fine, until it stops working, which is not a matter of if, but when. I bought this unit from wal-mart in March of 08 and I have already had to have it fixed 2 times for the same problem. Luckily I bought the extended warranty, but when that is up in a year or so then it's just a waiting game until this TV breaks again and it ends up in a landfill because I am definitely not paying to have this piece of junk fixed. There are many other entry level LCD sets that can be had for comparable prices so I strongly suggest going with any other brand than Westinghouse and by reading the other reviews it is clear that they have produced a terrible set when they made this TV. I think this TV is the only piece of electronics that I purchased without checking customer reviews and boy was that a mistake. Eventually I imagine I will sell this TV at a garage sale for about 10 bucks and I feel that will be overcharging. Once again, PLEASE do not buy this TV unless you enjoy frustration and wasting your money.","Date":"March 21, 2010"}

{"Title":"Actually You Don't Get What You Pay For.","Author":"Jamaal May","ReviewID":"RMM5YE1H3G2FL","Overall":"bad","Content":"The common axiom used when a product with a low price point breaks is \"You get what you pay for.\" I believe this sort of thinking is problematic in the consumers' never ending quest to be respected by the companies from which we purchase goods.In the case of the Westinghouse line of LCD t.v.s this is especially true. Yes the t.v.s' low prices can be considered a warning to stay away but they shouldn't be. When we just chalk a $700 t.v. that is defective up to \"getting what we pay for\", we create a climate where not only do we expect to get ripped off, Westinghouse is vindicated in a round about way. A defective t.v. is not worth $700 dollars. So no I did not get what I paid for. At any price a product should be expected to function properly for  a reasonable amount of time. If a manufacturer or retail outlet knows that it will not, it should not be available for sale.Saying \"well I guess I got what I paid for\" is tantamount to saying if Westinghouse or any other manufacturer sales wares at a reasonable price, they do not have a responsibility to provide a functioning product.Unfortunately the only way to hold them accountable at this point is to keep spreading the word in hopes that consumers will become wary enough of their products the business folds. But there will no doubt always be a long line of budget conscious consumers being punished for looking for a deal.","Date":"September 14, 2008"}

But to me even if it was new, the main menu/function is poorly conceived. Seems they've tried to 'dummy it down' for the less technically adept. It has an 'autosource' that when I first set up I had 'on', and I've never seen anything connected to a TV's function so worthless. If you're watching something and say powered up another connected device or are watching say a media player and your cables box 'hiccups'.... the TV makes up your mind for you and selects that device.I turned 'autosource' off. I also had another issue of the TV continually and by itself starts doing a complete channel rescan, where it's very hard to then stop short of unplugging. And hope you don't have one channel with lower volume turned up, because once a rescan starts by itself, volume and other controls will only work for the split seconds between each channel 'dial up'.But now a year later, even with 'autosource' off, no matter how i configure it (and I'm a professional video editor so I know something about wiring and configuration) the set keeps trying to rescan the channels and i have to unplug to stop.I've never had more buyer's remorse about a purchase in my life and am on the verge of getting rid of it whether I sell it or donate to charity.

Unfortunately, my problems are sporadic and, not noticing them when viewing cable television, I assumed that this problem was caused by the other input source I used on it (a video game console).  I had that unit serviced twice, and by the time I realized that the problem was with the television and not the input source, the unit was out of warranty by about 3 months.  Despite having documentation to show that my problems began only a few months after buying their product, their customer disservice department basically told me I was up poop creek.  I guess it was crazy of me to expect a $600 television to work properly for a whole year and a half.  Thanks for nothing, Westinghouse!

It looks like a good deal (and the image quality is great), but it will more than likely fail.","Date":"July 17, 2008"}

{"Title":"No picture or sound after 2 years of ownership","Author":"RobV \"history buff\"","ReviewID":"RQDV0MGPJA2XQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"After 2 years of ownership the picture / sound disappears after a few minutes of watching TV.  The only thing that works when this happens is the blue standby LED.  Searched on the internet and found that this is very common problem for Olevia LCD HDTVs as well as some other makes.  Before this occurred I was very pleased with the TV performance / operation.  However, 2 years of operation for an item that costs as much as this puts this manufacturer at the bottom of my list of preferred vendors.  I would definitely not purchase another TV or any other product from them.  They have serious quality control issues with their products.  You might be lucky and get a few good years of use out of one of their products, but given what I have seen I believe your product will ultimately fail prematurely.  By this I mean you will not get the expected life out of the product.  Save money, time, and aggravation by spending more money up front on a better quality product.  The odds are in your favor that you will ultimately save money over the long haul.","Date":"June 5, 2011"}

If you take your chances and buy a Philips plasma, you might as well buy the extended service contract as you will likely need it.I purchased the Philips 42in Plasma TV a little over a year ago and it started showing a thin red line vertically in the middle of the screen at about month 11. It was still under warranty and called customer service.The repair shop picked it up a few days later. This was in the beginning of December. It is now March and they have replaced several parts without fixing it.Here is the current workflow.1. Repair shop orders a part from Philips.2. Philips reviews the order to decide whether or not to give permission to ship the part since it is under Warranty.3. Philips reviews the order and eventually gives permission to send the part. (this seems to take 3 weeks each time)4. The part arrives 7-10 days later.Part doesn't fix the TV and it starts all over.Customer service has no way to track the status because it is in a different system.The repair shop has no way of tracking it because philips has to give them an Order number and this doesnt happen until they give permission to ship the part.Anyhow, when you call customer service, their only function is to tap dance around until you get aggravated and bored and get off the phone. They may promise callbacks, but it never happens. I even got one of their supervisors to admit that they provide service, but not good service.I have a friend with the comparable Samsung that he got at about the same time and it works fine. Also I have anotehr friend with the Sony and it works pretty well, but pricier.I have never had a TV break in the less than a year, but this one did and a neighbor purchased one as well and it lasted only 15 months was too costly to fix.Picture actually wasnt bad. just poor quality.","Date":"February 29, 2008"}

Ordered the 42\" Plasma via their refurbished outlet online. The product arrived after 5-7 day shipping time and would not stay on for more than 10-15 minutes at a time. There is a overheat sensor that was tripping. Contacted their technical support team who begrudingly opened a ticket to initiate a product return. It took another 2 calls in to get them to figure out why the shipping service hadn't come back out to pick up the TV - the pickup finally occurred 9 calendar days later. It is now 30 calendar days since I originally received the TV and the credit has still not been made to my credit card. The packing slip does not have a valid, trackable bill of lading. Also, their return policy is such that you must wait for the product to be officially checked back in before they will either credit you or provide a new product. Needless to say, we went and bought a Hitachi immediately after opening the ticket due to their policy of no advance exchanges. They also have not responded to my email inquiries through their web order site on where the return funds are. I will now have to call again. I will never buy a Philips or Magnavox product again due to the risk of having to deal with them directly.Update: After 37 days total I finally received the credit to my credit card and only after I called and inquired on status and was told my credit would be \"expedited\" (expedited took another 3 business days).They have never followed up with me regarding my emails, complaints or otherwise.

Some time after that it would occassionally let out a high pitched screetching sound out of its speakers and shut off. After unplugging it and replugging it back in i would get it to work for a short time when the problem would occur again.Finally i contact Philips and they said that this models was no longer under warranty and couldn't be replaced or fixed. They suggested to me to take it to a local repair shop to get it fixed...After doing research online i discovered that im not the only one with this problem. Apparently soon after warranty for many people the TV died. This problem is caused by a faulty part in the TV's motherboard that causes it to fry it completely. The average repair cost i saw online was $200+ which doesn't include labor. So for the first time in my entire life i had to throw away a TV.If you google this model you will find similar storys and you will wonder why wasn't this model recalled.

If it had just been a slight annoyance it wouldn't have been too bad, but this was pretty obvious, especially when the lights were off in the room.  In a dark room it made the picture quality sub-par at best.  I used good cables for my connections, but it did not solve the problem.  It is sad to say that my old Toshiba 13\" TV/DVD combo had better picture quality than this Philips.The white light bleeding onto the screen was so bad that the black bars from the widescreen movie were actually gray.  I realize you get what you pay for, but for $400, I would expect a bit better quality.  It was very disappointing.If you are going to use this in a brighter room, than this would be a pretty good TV, but if you have it in a bedroom it may not work as well.

I am editing it now, as three years into owning this set it fell to the bad capacitor manufacturing flaw.  If this has happened to you please join the class action law suit at:[...]It is my advice that Samsung televisions be avoided at all costs.  It's not just that the devices are flawed, it's that Samsung refuses to stand behind their products.I will personally never buy Samsung again, and will advise my friends and family to do the same.---I purchased this set as an upgrade to last year's high-end Samsung LCD.  All I can say is, what a difference a year makes!  The picture quality of this set is outstanding.  Colors are rich and vibrant, blacks are deep and well... black.  When I had my previous LCD I would look at friend's plasma and DLP sets with envy because I had to admit, their picture looked at lot better.  LCD technology has certainly come a long way since.  The picture quality of the Samsung LN-T4665F matches that of even high-end plasmas.  If you don't trust my word, do yourself a favor and read the CNET review of this model.Some people complain about the glossy screen over plain matte as with most LCDs.  I personally prefer the gloss as it adds to the vibrance of the picture.  Also when it's off, the set does not just look like a big computer monitor.  Don't worry about glare unless you have a window or lamp directly facing the display.  I have a 10 by 6 foot oversized window 45 degrees from the set and glare is not a problem.There's a lot of talk about HDMI dropouts with this set, but in my case Amazon shipped a unit with the latest firmware and motherboard and I have not witnessed any problems in the week I've had the set.Anyone on the fence about ordering from Amazon should rest easy.  Their delivery is handled in most areas through a \"white glove\" service called Eagle.  There's also a liberal 30-day return policy.  You won't get that with most online retailers.  If you order this set remember to register online with Samsung right away any you will receive an additional three months on top to the standard one-year warranty.","Date":"June 22, 2007"}

Finally , found a local repair shop and the guy there said he had never heard of a problem like the one we are experiencing.  Been with out tv for going on three weeks.  Not sure about quality or quality of service.","Date":"September 1, 2007"}
{"Title":"Checking for shipping damage","Author":"Thomas E. Mendenhall","ReviewID":"R2AULV6FQ847HQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was in a hurry to get back to work so when the trucking company delivered the Samsung mid day I signed and he drove off in a hurry (that's probably why they are called Eagle). When opening the top of the box a few minutes later I noticed it had been dropped on the corner and  was cracked and delaminated over a 6\" area of the corner. It was so bad that if it was turned on it would have shorted out immediately. There is only a thin piece of styrofoam to protect each corner (how much could styrofoam cost?). I called the truck driver immediately on his cell phone (about 5 minutes after he drove off) and he wouldn't come back to pick it up (it wasn't unpackaged other than me opening the top flap). After reading the paper work it said the shipper would unpack and detrash (he didn't offer to do that).Moral of the Story: don't sign the shipping invoice until you and the delivery person open the box and look it over for damage. Even better would be to plug it in and verify it's not DOA (dead on arrival).Amazon said they would make good, although Santa is coming 2 weeks late this year.

Ma \"professor\"","ReviewID":"R1NVXE77N8VZEU","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had filed a report about this TV before (see below) and do not want to repeat my ordeal again here. But just want you to know since then, I have received many emails from owners of this TV and mentioned that they encountered similar problems after a year or two.from customersSo I am very suspicious about those 5-star reviews  who claim they have had this TV for more than a year and happy about this TV. I am wondering about their motivations for posting such a review. If you happen to own a good set that does not mean this product does not have major problems. Just read a few of those 1-star review. It is not responsible to potentially put future customers through similar situations.------------------------------------------------My old Review in June:I bought an LNT4665F last June. Then the nightmare begins. In this May, the TV screen went black intermittently and there is only audio left most of the time -- apparent this is not an uncommon problem with this TV according some reports here. Then we have been dealing with the customer services since then and the TV is still NOT fixed as of now. It is in the warranty that they must fix the TV within 21 days. Otherwise you are entitled to a new TV. Well, it has been nearly 45 days and my family and I are still watching a black screen. The executive customer relations department still tell us that they will try to fix it.So if you do not want to spend nearly 2k to buy a TV that is bound to become \"refurbished\", then do NOT buy this TV. Or if you are expecting good customer services, then do not buy from Samsung. My wife essentially gave up calling them in the end and then I have to deal with the customer services.I bought this TV because I saw good reviews on this site and on others about this TV. Well, how wrong was I! Maybe most of the people who gave good reviews do not yet have the TV long enough... So give it a year or two and see what happens. And wait till you have to deal with their customer services. I hope you all will come back and re-rate this TV, just to be fair to future buyers.My review is based on my personal experience. I am a professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, and normally do not bother to complain about things like this. But this is by far the worst piece of electronics and the most terrible experience that I ever had in my life. So I think I have to do something about it.You are welcome to contact me for more information if that helps you to make your decision about buying this TV or not.----- Comments by July 21As mentioned in my previous review, I have been dealing with Samsung customer services and executive customer relations for the past month and half. Many promises for fixing the TV but no results at all. I here want to share my experience with future buyers.You know according to the warranty, Samsung has 21 business days to fix your TV. After that you are entitled to a new TV or money back. But the reality is, they will send someone to fix it and then close the ticket. So if the problem persists, they will reset the clock and have another four weeks to drag on. That is exactly happening to my TV. So you could end up with a bad TV for months without any remorse from Samsung.If you want to file your complaint to a higher authority, they will give an address which is essentially the same address of the customer service center (I did my research). Do you suppose such a letter will fall in the hands of someone who matters or cares?I did some research on the Internet these days about Samsung. Apparently the problems with my TV and my experience with Samsung customer service are not uncommon at all. Anyone can google \"samsung customer service\" to find out more.About other good reviews about this TV on this site, I would suggest the reader pay attention to if the reviewers have owned the TV long enough to find out the problems -- I was equally happy about the TV for the first few months. But TVs like this are not supposed to broke after a couple of years, nor would it take so long to get it fixed. My expertise is in electrical engineering. Unless there is some serious design or manufacturing flaws, such problems should not be so common.So be wise when you choose your next TV.---------- Comments on July 22.","Date":"July 21, 2008"}

As with many other reviewers, I loved it and told all my friends to buy a Samsung. After 11 months, the screen went black. Sound, but no picture. Called for warranty service and they took my set into the shop. While in the shop, they could not reproduce the problem, so they upgraded the software and brought it back to me. TV worked for approx. 9 months, and then the problem reappeared. Called Samsung again. Even though it is the same problem that was not fixed the first time under warranty, they will not cover the repair. I have spent a lot of time making phone calls to them and explaining the issue to no avail. Had repair out to the house recently and it was diagnosed with a bad inverter board, which is permanently attached to the LCD screen, meaning that I have to replace the whole screen to the tune of $1000.00! I paid over $2k for this set and expected it to last a long time. Instead I got 21 months of use before it became a piece of junk hanging on my wall. What can I say? Samsung customer service leaves a LOT to be desired. Read on for a LOT of other reviewers saying the exact same thing. If you buy from them, make sure you get the longest extended warranty you can find......you're gonna need it!","Date":"June 23, 2009"}

Everything else is functioning normally.It has been lightly used, since I used to be away most weekdays on business.After researching the problem briefly on the internet, it appears this problem is fairly prevalent.  That concerns me.The Samsung CSR was unable to identify the problem.  That concerns me.I was referred to their nearest authorized repair service---sixty miles away.  I live in the New York metropolitan area, with something like 18 million people.  That concerns me.All of the reports I've read are still ignorant as to what the problem is, are still waiting for assistance, and/or have had a recurrence of ths issue (this last indicates that the wrong repair was made or that the part being used is inappropriately designed for its intended use).

Over time, these capacitors WILL over-heat, degrade and then ultimately FAIL so that you will not be able to power-up your TV anymore.  Sometimes these \"under-rated capacitors\" have even been known to explode and throw sparks and smoke out of the back of the TV.Either way ---> Samsung's LNT4665F has a life of about 2 to 3 years, which is DISGRACEFUL!But the worse problem is that Samsung KNOWS about this obvious DESIGN FLAW (which could actually cause a FIRE in someone's house by the way) but... instead of fixing it, Samsung has chosen to screw-over their customer base by not fixing this well-known Capacitor problem.Car companies will recall and fix known safety problems (EVEN IF THEY'RE OUT OF WARRANTY)...But NOT Samsung - Nope, they've chosen to screw-over their customers instead.Samsung needs to make this right - or I will NEVER buy another Samsung product again - EVER!","Date":"December 7, 2011"}

Purchased 9/2007. Used only 6 months each year (we unplug TV when away) since we spend our summers elsewhere and travel a lot. Stopped working 9/2010.  Effectively lasted for only 18 months of use. I would expect a longer life from a $2400 TV.In 9/2010 our TV started having long delays turning on and, after a few weeks, it would not turn on at all, with the start switch clicking incessantly until I unplugged the TV.  Samsung is not accepting any responsibility since it is out of warranty. Internet search reveals that the problem is widespread and primarily due to deficient capacitors that Samsung installed in these TVs and is a problem for many (if not most) Samsung LCD TVs, with problems occuring after a year or two of use.  There are hundreds of postings regarding these problems for Samsung TVs (primarily those sold in 2007 and 2008) on various web sites. Assume that Samsung quietly fixed this problem on their newer LCD TVs, but who knows.  They are being silent on this issue.You will note that there are a huge number of favorable reviews by those who just bought this TV in 2007 and 2008.  I loved it too at that time. The picture was great.  You will also note that starting in early to mid 2009 the reviews are almost all negative as the TVs stopped working, mostly due to capacitor failures.  I am now part of that ever growing list of newly dissatisfied customers.There is a ton of advice on the internet for fixing Samsung LCD TVs with capacitor problems, including detailed YouTube videos. Based on these I removed the back of my TV (24 screws!) and the metal cage on the power module (or whatever it is called) to discover two failed capacitors (one bulging, the other bulging and leaking, presumably due to overheating).  I am planning to replace these and one more capacitor that is similar but has not failed yet.  Hope this works as it has for many others.As others have stated I will not buy another Samsung.  Have temporarily replaced the non-functioning Samsung with a new VISIO CRT TV (hopefully more reliable, but at least a lot cheaper).  Will use it to replace a 20+ year old workhorse CRT television in the bedroom if I can get the Samsung working again.

Apparently Samsung has installed capacitors in the power supply which have a voltage rating much too low for the purpose they serve. Eventually these capacitors will start to fail (anywhere from 16 to 24 months depending on use). Luckily I found a gentleman who had the same problem and fixed his own TV, and fortunately for me I work for an electronics manufacturing company.

Before January the 4665 was being manufactured with the older trident processor and after December with the new cortez processor.

It features multiple HDMI inputs and in overall not a bad TV.Now the bad part, I paid a fortune for this set when it first came out and after about 13 to 14 months it began acting up.  When you turned it on the screen would have pink scattered shapes all over the picture.  In addition it would come on and shut off in 2 seconds.  You may have to turn it on 10 to 20 times to get it to work and hopefully the screen would not be pink.After some web research I found out that thousands of people were having the same problem.  I contacted the place where I purchased it and they told me that the power supply board was $650 and the labor was $150.  The bill could be over $1000 if anything else was found wrong.  I took it apart and found 3 bad electrolytic capacitors and replaced them for under $14 and an hour of work.  It is all over the web how Samsung used 10 VDC capacitors in the assembly of the power supply and they are popping and causing the TVs to go bad.I fixed it and it has worked wonderfully since.  I replaced the capacitors with the same value and physical size capacitors but I used 20 VDC rated ones and I have had no problems.  I posted this review because this problem is happening on several Samsung TV models and people should know that they are easily repairable and it does not cost a fortune.  Samsung make great products but this issue hurts their reputation.  They don't seem to be standing up and fixing a known problem.
