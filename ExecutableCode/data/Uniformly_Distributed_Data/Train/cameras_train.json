{"Title":"A definite winner- Buy this camera!","Author":"Baltic Books \"Vic\"","ReviewID":"R2UEFKWZVXP60B","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera.  We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the  camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while  we nervously left our Canon SLR at home.  The camera performed marvelously.  We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our  needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were  amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings.  We took shots  at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly  the projected image on the screen was readable!  While staying in the  countryside in a traditional Mongolian \"ger\" (tent), we shot an  incredible photo of the predawn sky-- even the morning stars are clearly  distinguishable!Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the  photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP  Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper.  I doubt that most people  would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard  developed snapshot.  The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use  and functional for most home use.  You will absolutely love the Quickstitch  utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots!One of the only  weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the  optical viewfinder and the digital one.  If you frame... say, a head and  shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will discover that digitally  the camera sees a much broader area.  Olympus should do a little better job  calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that, you will want to invest  in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop around for the best  price.  Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory  card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the flash memory card,  slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into any computer.  You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your  table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do you think a  16MB memory card will be too small for your needs?  Olympus, through their  website, is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December  that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards.","Date":"November 23, 1999"}
{"Title":"Truly a great little camera, especially for the price","Author":"\"jeugenides\"","ReviewID":"R28RQHJKHM2A2W","Overall":"good","Content":"If it had an optical zoom lens, this camera would be perfect! But, it would also cost a lot more. The  camera is nice and small, fits easily in a coat pocket so you can take it  anywhere. Picture quality is great, a bit soft on landscapes but all  digital cameras are, even the 2 megapixel ones don't really do landscapes  that well. The macro shots from this camera look spectacular, and people  shots are just great. They print out very nicely, too. The autofocus works  very well, and the metering is excellent (you can adjust the exposure up  and down 1 stop if you want, but so far I haven't found it necessary).  Color saturation is great, and very accurate. You can't adjust the white  balance manually, but fortunately the camera's automatic white balancing  works extremely well. You have 4 options when taking pictures, SQ (standard  quality), HQ (high quality), SHQ (super high quality) and SHQ uncompressed.  SQ is 640x480, the rest are 1260x980, the only difference being the  compression used. HQ uses the most compression, and SHQ uncompressed uses  no compression at all (a nice feature that many cameras don't have -for  those really detailed shots). I find HQ works just fine for most pictures,  and I can get 73 of those on a 16MB card. The viewfinder is a bit small,  but not hard to find, and it's quite clear. The LCD is good, even in the  daylight. Controls are easy to learn and well laid out. It's easy to view  your pictures on the LCD, and you can delete any one (or all of them) at  the touch of a button. You can also protect any of them from being  accidentally erased. There's a 3x feature that allows you to see a portion  of the picture a 3 times the size, useful for determining how sharp it  really is, or if you moved the cameral during the shot. The flash works  very well for its size, and you can easily turn it off, set it for fill, or  red-eye reduction. The panorama mode works great, even hand-held. I took  some shots of a church with the steeple way, way up there, using the  panorama feature, and when I assembled the shots later on the computer  (it's an automatic process) the result was tremedous. You could not see the  seams at all, even though I took the shots hand-held. Great stuff. The  camera is pretty sturdy too. I dropped it from about 3 feet and  (thankfully) it survived. The software is reasonably good, and I really  like the little Camedia thumbnail viewer. Downloading from the camera is  smooth, although a bit slow since it's serial. However, the FlashPath  adapter works really nicely and is much, much faster. The camera uses batteries pretty quickly,  but if you get some NIMH rechargeables you'll have no worries. Go to Thomas  Distributors on the web, and buy the MAHA MHC-C204F charger  and  8 NIMH batteries and you'll never run out. With the MAHA you can even recharge them in your car. Don't buy the Olympus NIMH charger, it only works with Olympus batteries (yes I tried it with some others and it  got so hot it almost caught fire) and doesn't have the features of the MAHA  (and it costs quite a bit more).  By the way, the camera comes with a  home version of PhotoDeluxe, which is an OK photo editor. Has the basics.  But you'll probably want something else eventually. I recommend PhotoSuite  II - really great for the price and very easy to use.  Anyway, I guess  I've rambled a bit, but bottom line I'm very happy with this camera. Going  digital is so freeing - you can take as many shots as you want, no film  costs, see exactly what you have before you walk away, and then put it all  into your computer to play with.","Date":"October 29, 1999"}
{"Title":"good camera, but it costs more than you think...","Author":"\"superstar_kennyd\"","ReviewID":"R34XX9OGNJ8Z6T","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera and my very first camera forover $200. Overall, I'm happy with it - it's easy to carry andtakes great pictures.  There's not a pause between pressing the button and the camera actually taking the picture, which is a problem with other digital cameras.  Some things to keep in mind though:1. Downloading from the camera to your computer is EXTREMELY slow through the Serial Cable.  Buy the SMART DISK floppy. Basically, your memory card fits right into the floppy disk, and the floppy disk works just like any floppy.  The only bad thing about the floppy is it takes two lithium batteries.2. If you have a laptop, you probably want to buy the DDSMFLSAD Smart Media Adapter for PCMCIA slot. Does the same thing as the SMART DISK floppy, but obviously cheaper. Same downloading speed.3. If you don't buy 1 or 2, then buy an AC adapter (which by the way, doesn't come with the camera). Your camera must be on to transfer the pictures to your computer. Again, extremely SLOW.4. There isn't a protective covering for the LCD monitor, so buy a camera case. This case doesn't come with the camera. Costs around $20 at any store. Actually you can buy the Olympus 200-523 Accessory Kit which has the AC Adapter, 2 MB card, and camera case.5.  This camera comes with an 8 MB card which holds 36 HQ pictures or 18 SHQ pictures. I can't tell the difference between the two qualities.  8 MB is good enough. After taking about two days worth of pictures, I download them to my computer and erase the 8 MB card. I don't feel the need to have more or larger cards. But then again, if I traveled and didn't have access to my PC, then I would invest in a couple 32 MB card.6. Camera doesn't have zoom. I took some pictures of my friends running a marathon, and it would've been great to have the zoom feature. I sometimes regret not buying the Olympus D-400 Zoom Digital Camera for $600.  If you like taking close-up pictures without being near the object, then don't buy this camera.So in summary, I actually spent an extra $200 bucks ($500 total) to make this purchase worthwhile.","Date":"November 29, 1999"}
{"Title":"Best buy at this price for everyone who wants a digital cam!","Author":"J. Wade \"DrkAngl\"","ReviewID":"R1EKQW45D5SGDU","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera takes outstanding photos-both up close and at a distance! Plus, it comes with its own programs(on CD) which means it saves you money...unlike some of the cameras out there which still require you to buy  more of their items just to view the photos.  I do recommend anyone who  buys this camera to also buy the adapter package, as batteries do NOT last  long if you plan to use the LCD monitor(which I love-because you can see  the WHOLE picture without closing either eye).  Either way, this camera is  well worth the money, and the different ways you can shoot a photo is a  must for the beginner! Easy to use and upload photos.","Date":"November 19, 1999"}
{"Title":"A comment on Quality, Batteries and Memory","Author":"Philip Roos","ReviewID":"R17MC6HOH9AVE6","Overall":"good","Content":"Without question....buy the camera.  Do what I did and check the reviews.  Amazon's is slightly off mark. Most rank the D340R at the top of the \"Under $300.00\" class.  1280X960 TRUE megapixel resolution is hard to beat at $250.00 (what I paid) and the quality is just what others  have said....1st rate!Unlike Amazon's review, it IS a battery miser,  second only to the HP C30 (1000 photos).  The full motion LCD screen is the  only credible drain and not using it will give you well over 700 shots on a  set of AA's.My camera came with an 8mb card.  Amazon is incorrect in  stating 8megs give you only 60 standard quality photos.  It's 122 640x480  pictures.  If you plan on doing a lot of picture posting or emailing,  640x480 size pictures don't overwhelm the servers out there.  You get 36 HQ  pictures (1280x960)...4x the file size of a standard quality pic.  18 SHQ  pictures (1280x960 but with superb crispness and detail) fit on the card.  What am I saying?  You won't need to buy a spare card if you can hook up to  the computer every few days or weekly at the most.  I'll buy a couple extra  cards for any long road trip!A final comment on downloading.  Serial  cable connections are inherently slower than USB hookups.  However, the  Olympus D-340R's download time through it's serial connection is remarkably  fast...a lot faster than HP's and Fuji's....about 5-7 secs per 640x480 pic.I hope this helps.  This camera truly is fantastic and I've become both  a website buff and amateur photographer as a result.  Happy New Year!","Date":"January 1, 2000"}
{"Title":"This one is the best!","Author":"Frank Rizzo","ReviewID":"R9I7M0XQXL2K0","Overall":"good","Content":"After going through Sony, HP's, and Kodak cameras, this one is definately the best.  People that have problems with battery life are obviously keeping the LCD screen on alot.  If you turn it on to take a picture, review it, then shut it off till you get to the next picture, it will last  for days on hi-capacity Ni-Hi rechargable batteries.  In my opinion, DON'T  buy the AC adapter.  If you are using hi-capacity rechargables, you will  not kill the battery life by downloading pics into your computer.  Once  they are downloaded, turn the camera off.  People make the mistake of  editing their pictures on their computer and the camera is still left on.  Referring to only downloading one picture at  a time - use the software available from the Olympus website.  The software  that comes with the camera is junk.  Their new software gives you more  simplicity and control over what you download into your computer.  In my  opinion, this is the best camera around for the price.  You will not be  dissapointed.","Date":"December 16, 1999"}
{"Title":"An excellent camera and an excellent company!","Author":"M. Caruso","ReviewID":"R1EELIQFJBPD0A","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my Olympus D340-R camera since April of 1999 and I just can't say enough good things about it. I love it. It is the BEST camera that I've ever owned or used. It has so many functions and the software that comes with it is fabulous. You just can't take a bad picture with this camera.  The ONLY downside is that it does use up batteries quite a bit so I've got  an AC adapter for mine for when I use it indoors. Also when the camera malfunctioned (my fault, water got  spilled on it) Olympus fixed it for free under warranty and had it back to  me within two weeks working perfectly again. I have not ever had such a  positive experience in dealing with a company before. Their warranty  service was excellent and their products are even better.","Date":"November 4, 1999"}
{"Title":"Best Product for the Price","Author":"David Gustafson","ReviewID":"R3JLCMA1YYG3ZF","Overall":"good","Content":"Before I bought this camera, I never took pictures: the marginal cost of taking any given shot was too high, given the film purchase and developing.  With a digital camera, this cost drops to ZERO - I can take all the pictures I want!  In that respect, it's absolutely worth the $ that  you'll spend on the camera, a case, NiMH batteries, and a charger.  Contrary to many reviews, the camera DOES NOT eat batteries too quickly; I  used it heavily for days before the meter showed any drain.  The desirable  missing feature is an optical zoom, but you can't expect one at this price.  (Those of you not living on a college student's budget may want to post  the extra $, though!)  Pictures are amazingly clear and colorful, and  download time is nothing to complain about.  A great deal - GO BUY THIS  CAMERA!","Date":"December 5, 1999"}

{"Title":"A nifty little camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R6P3K3TWRTJB5","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera, and I am quite impressed so far. It is reasonably easy to use, and the picture quality is more than adequate for my purposes. Standard quality mode is OK if you don't enlarge the photo too  much, and if you aren't trying to capture fine details or textures. HQ and  SHQ offer significant improvements in image quality. It is annoying that  the AC adapter is not included and must be purchased separately. If you  minimize your use of the LCD display and use a separate device to download  pictures, you can probably get by without the AC adaptor. Overall, I am  very satisfied with the camera so far and am looking forward to taking LOTS  of pictures without having to pay and wait for film and processing.","Date":"December 1, 1999"}
{"Title":"The D340R is a great camera!","Author":"Jessica","ReviewID":"R2PFKVKN01H12D","Overall":"good","Content":"So many people have written about the technical part of this wonderful camera. I agree with many of them. You won't feel bad about spending your $$$. I've shopped around and I've made my decison with confidence. (Yes,  you can find this item for less at other e-stores, but I trust Amazon, they  deliver promptly and their Customer Service is great!)  Some customers have  said that this camera eats batteries like crazy. It's only true when you  use the LCD monitor to TAKE pictures. If you use it  for reviewing (and  deleting) the pictures you have taken, it lasts a long, long time. I have  purchased my camera before Thanksgiving. It's December 12, and after taking  hundreds of pictures (most using flash), I am STILL using the batteries it  came with!  Lemme tell ya a little secret, if you do take pictures using  the LCD monitor, and you get the message that the battery is low, turn off  the camera, let it rest for a little while and turn it back on again. The  battery life will show full again! No need to change the batteries until it  tells you it's dead and you have been taking pictures using the viewfinder.  Now, it is not a bad idea to get yourself some rechargeable NiMH batteries.  I've seen many good comments about the brand MAHA. Also, I have seen great  reviews on MAHA's charger model MH-C204F. Some people have mentioned them  here. But I didn't know where to purchase them from. So here you go. For  more info on the MAHA products, go to Maha-comm website. And to purchase  these two products, check out Thomas-distributing's website (sorry I can't  include the exact web addresses according to the reviews guidelines, but it  isn't hard to figure out). For around $50 I got the charger and 8 NiMH  batteries. Now you can go on the road and not worry about your batteries  dying or where to purchase them.  It's a lot of fun to have a digital  camera and take hundreds and hundreds of pictures knowing you don't have to  pay for developement or wait to finally see your pictures. Just download  them and enjoy or use the video cable to see your photos on your TV. Or  just use the LCD monitor! :)  -- From a happy Olympus/Amazon customer. :)","Date":"December 12, 1999"}

Upon returning home I installed the included software and  downloaded the pictures. One gripe regarding the software package;it would  be nice to have a \"Lite\" version of the instructions for use for  us novices. I'm sure the help section has an answer to every question, but  all I want to do is the basics and this software has so many features it  gets to be a pain to find answers. I did get it working tho, and am truly  impressed with the quality of the pictures I took. I did not get the power  converter, but am planning to use rechargable batteries so the drain during  downloading is no issue.

In retrospect, I wish we had purchased the rechargeable batteries instead  and not had to deal with plugging in a cord, but the adapter works well.

{"Title":"Great camera, but here's some things you won't like","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3GSWZQBKTJGN1","Overall":"good","Content":"To find out what's good about this camera, read the other reviews.  Here are some things that missed the mark.  The manual is a human factors disaster.  The print is tiny, the table of contents is on about page 30, if  you can find it and they used that confounded \"all four languages on  each page\" format instead of four separate sections with black blocks  at the edge to make each section easy to find.  The software had a few  problems.  There was a little utility that appears to be a general camera  interface for Windows.  When I tried to set it up, I found that it listed a  wide variety of cameras but the D-340R wasn't among them!  It also came  with Adobe Photo Delux.  I've heard a lot of raves about this and other  Adobe products.  They were all from people who'd never tried competing  products. In other words, the software will do a lot, but as with the  manual, the human factors are terrible. They don't even follow the  \"Save As\" convention to output different file formats. With  Adobe, you use the old \"export\" convention.  I also found that  some of the JPEG's output by Photo Deluxe could no longer be read by the  other viewing software that comes with the camera.  I recommend you find  people who have other cameras and look at their photo processing software  to find a more user friendly program. Finally, the manual frequently  recommends using the AC adapter for some common operations.  Well, if its  the best way to go, why is does it not come with the camera?  You may as  well buy one when you order the camera.  As for the camera, its fairly easy  to use, but not before you've read the manual which isn't easy to use.  Once you've done that, the pictographs make sense and the frequent user  shouldn't have to consult the manual again.  A little more effort at user  friendliness here would obviate the need for a manual for most  operations.Does all this mean you shouldn't buy the D-340R? No.  If the  hardware turns out to be reliable, its price performance combination is  hard to beat, and the difficulties are all surmountable.  They just make it  an target for the competition.  If you need a good basic digital camera  now.  Buy it.  If you can wait, keep your eyes open for improved products  from all manufacturers.","Date":"October 21, 1999"}

It is easy to use (once you read the manual), and it's a snap to transfer images to your computer via the included serial  cable and software.  I am somewhat disappointed in the manual.  It is  difficult to read and it does't include all the information you might want.  For example, I was disappointed that it apparently had no Twain driver.  But when I browsed the included CD-ROM, I noticed it had a Twain directory.  I clicked Setup, and voila!  I now don't even use the included software; I  use my old friend Paint Shop Pro and the Twain compatible feature that was  not even mentioned in the manual!  One other little glitch I noticed about  my camera -- it does not erase all pictures at once except from the  software.  The manual explains how to erase all using the camera buttons,  but it doesn't work for me.  I have to erase them one at a time, or connect  to the computer and use the software to erase them.

But for an  entry level camera this one is hard to beat.","Date":"January 7, 2000"}

I understood ZERO about digital photography and had it up and running in no  time. Make sure you get the following accessories:(1) A floppy adaptor,  because moving pictures to your computer by cable is too slow.(2) A  16MB memory cartridge because you will not be able to stop taking  pictures.(3) Extra rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger because the  one minor drawback of this baby is the way it eats batteries for  breakfast.I cannot say enough good things about this camera.

The next day I went to the store to check it out and was so impressed that I put two of them on hold for Christmas  Gifts (one for him and one for me). An added special was a free 16MB smart  media card was included. I took the instruction booklet from my camera box  and have been reviewing it off and on up until Christmas.I also located  this web site and have been reading/comparing the comments and the more I  read the more convinced I was that I made a good choice. My son-in-law and  I opened our camera on Christmas Eve. and began taking pictures immediately  and it was awesome.  I echo the comments of most of the other owners that  give this OUTSTANDING camera a high rating. P.S. We both received a small  four (4) battery recharger with 4 batteries in it plus the 4 none  rechargeable batteries that came with the camera.","Date":"December 27, 1999"}
{"Title":"High Quality for Beginners","Author":"T. A Nossem","ReviewID":"R1DKG0M5U00U20","Overall":"good","Content":"If you're looking for a digital camera that can not only handle web photos, but also some non-web pictures, the Olympus 340R is a good bet.I did a lot of research, including Amazon customer reviews.  At $400 in early 2000 (everything electronic has is relative to date), it may represent the  best value going.The pictures are great (don't rely on the autoflash  indoors...for indoor shots, set the camera for flash).  The operating  manual could be more user-friendly, but is tolerable.  Once you get the  hang of it, it's a very easy camera to operate.  The built-in shutter  cover, which doubles as the power shutoff is an example of simple  engineering genius.On the downside, you'll read that the 340R is a  \"battery hog,\" and it is.  Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride  batteries (get 8 + a charger) are a must.  I also recommend the FlashPath  adapter.  It's a great way to transfer your picture files to your computer  and saves on battery usage.Though I LOVE Amazon, the truth is that  you'll be better served if you buy generic versions of these accessories,  rather than the Olympus versions that Amazon sells.Another battery  saving technique is to avoid using the built-in mini-monitor to take  pictures.  You don't need it.Net, for $400, you can't beat this one.","Date":"February 5, 2000"}

It is better than I expected from some of the reviews and they for the most part were generaly positive.  I am still on my first set of batteries and have  taken well over 100 pictures.  I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.  It is a blast to be able to take a marginal shot  and not to suffer the cost of developing a throw-away.  If it turns out to  be good, GREAT. If it turns out bad, so what, you have not lost a thing. I  am satisified with the resolution.  It takes wonderful pictures.  I am just  an average user and clearly not a professional, however, I recognize a  quality image when I see one, and have taken 1000's of pictures with our  Canon AE-1.  If I had it to do over, I would still want the Olympus 340R.","Date":"January 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"An excellent camera with tons of features for its price.","Author":"dave920 (dave920@hotmail.com)","ReviewID":"R1AYSLEWQ7Z296","Overall":"good","Content":"For only $300, this camera is an excellent choice for anyone who needs to take digital photographs.  It has more features than I ever thought possible, including the ability to slice a picture into 9 sections and zoom  in on each one (on the LCD screen), and hook it up easily to a TV and use  the slide show function to display your photos on a larger  screen.Although the positives outway the negatives, there are still some  aspects I could do without.  I have had the camera for 2 days (and have  been using it very much as well), and already the battery low warning has  appeared.  I read that you should really use the AC adapter for doing  'camera --> PC' transfers, as well as connecting it to your TV.  I  haven't done that, so I'm sure those are 2 main reasons the batteries are  already low.Also, it is suggested that you use the LCD screen for  viewing pictures only, as not only does it eat up battery life but you can  take more steady pictures when using the viewer rather than the  LCD.Camera --> PC transfers are slow and you can get quite impatient  waiting for the included software to index/thumbnail all the pics on the  cam before you can do anything such as download, etc.But, for the price  it's an excellent camera.  You can save in .bmp, .jpg, and .tif using the  included software.  Using the lowest image quality mode, you can store  about 120 on the included 8 megabyte SmartMedia card, and they come out  exceptionally well, too.  4 flash features, zoom, and more make this camera  a necessity for the novice photographer or just about anyone.","Date":"October 17, 1999"}

The same money buys a lot more these days but this one has honestly been worth every penny.It has been used (and seriously abused) pretty much daily for 5 years and is still going strong. I have NEVER had a single problem with it.I've purchased 4 other digital cameras since this one, only to return them (a Canon, HP 320, HP 635, and Olympus D-390). Nothing beats the quality of the pics on my Olympus D-340R. I've never experienced photos with red-eyes like I did constantly with the others (I don't use the red-eye reduction - typically just point and shoot), and the color/sharpness are far superior to the others.The drawbacks are that there is no optical zoom, and I do go through a lot of batteries (but we use the LCD alot). The megapixels could be higher, but it works ok for me. Although I use it primarily for web use, I've found the SHQ shots print out superbly (with my photo printer).I recommend upgrading to a 128 MB memory card - I did this past year, and wowsa! I can take nearly 600 HQ pics or nearly 300 SHQ pics. I also recommend getting a memory card reader for super-fast downloading, because the serial cable is painfully slow. With a card reader you can also bypass the Camedia software, which leaves something to be desired.I am amazed that this camera has served me so well for so long! And until I can afford a $500+ model....I'll happily keep on using it!","Date":"December 19, 2003"}

This is a wonderful camera. I got it to take vacation pictures (in fact it didn't ship in time for my departure, so I simply redirected the shipment to catch  up to me enroute; I *love* amazon.com!!!!) and as soon as I got it I  started clicking away.I was a little concerned about the statement in  the product summary that said a set of 4 standard AA batteries would last  only about 60 shots; fortunately this is not consistent with my experience.  I took between 50-100 pictures a day and went through three sets of  batteries in 12 days; that's about 200-300 shots per set of batteries, not  the 60 listed in the product summary.Obviously it would still be better  (both economically and environmentally) to switch to rechargeable batteris  and I've ordered a set, but if you have to use regular batteries don't be  too alarmed by that statement in the product summary. Just be careful to  follow the manual's recommendation and use the A/C adapter when downloading  to the computer or other non-picture-taking activities.I had a few  problems with the pictures coming out too bright or too dim but I found  that by following the hints in the manual (enable/force/disable the flash,  or point and half-click to set the exposure before the actual shot, etc) I  was able to get good results and for the ones that came out too bright or  dim I was able to fix them by adjusting the brightness using the supplied  'CAMEDIA Master' software.To reiterate: Great camera!

I strongly recommend  getting the Olympus 200-547 16MB Smart Media for Digital Camera PCMCIA Card  (Amazon's price on it is better than good - I paid over $100) because it  makes the taking and viewing seemless with your computer - if you can  accept PC Cards, most can.  The Smart Media card allows you to instantly  view images, send via email, post to image hosting sites for auctions, etc.  without using Olympus' rather lousy, but usable, Camedia Software.

Yup, eats batteries fairly quickly. 4 of them.Serial port download is slow.Bulky. Heavy and quite a size compared to some of the dinky dig-cams about now.Good:Contrary to noevilpeople, I've found this camera to be extremely durable. It has lasted 4 years with me. Including a drop onto a marble floor, numerous plane trips, a house fire and a touch of condensation. good going. Name a PC or printer that still goes as well after 4 years!Seems to take quite a few pictures for its memory. 36 HQ on a 8MB card is good going. newer cameras seem to squeeze in less, even at the same res, and with no discernible increase in quality. It can take 16MB cards easily enough (I got one), but any bigger (32MB) and I recall you have to send it back to Olympus to get it retro-fitted or something!Price. it's cheap now!Small display on top of the camera gives you enough info without having to use the power-hungry lcd a lot. LCD only needs to be used for macro shots (<10 cm away) and panorama shots. Otherwise, just use the normal viewfinder.All in all, this camera has done me well. the only real lack is the optical zoom, which is why after 4 years I'm after a new camera, but for the beginner this is a superb camera.","Date":"April 9, 2003"}

Other than that, a great  camera. Its easy to use and the pictures come out good.","Date":"May 28, 2000"}

{"Title":"I like it and would not trade","Author":"James E. Petty","ReviewID":"R168UBTELPN70M","Overall":"good","Content":"I recieved an Olympus 340R for Christmas and am completly happy.  It is better than I expected from some of the reviews and they for the most part were generaly positive.  I am still on my first set of batteries and have  taken well over 100 pictures.  I rarely use anything other than the optical  viewfinder and this must result in signifantly longer battery life.  It is  simple and fun to use.  It is a blast to be able to take a marginal shot  and not to suffer the cost of developing a throw-away.  If it turns out to  be good, GREAT. If it turns out bad, so what, you have not lost a thing. I  am satisified with the resolution.  It takes wonderful pictures.  I am just  an average user and clearly not a professional, however, I recognize a  quality image when I see one, and have taken 1000's of pictures with our  Canon AE-1.  If I had it to do over, I would still want the Olympus 340R.","Date":"January 9, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great features, great price","Author":"Juan","ReviewID":"R11840HHXFU2ZW","Overall":"good","Content":"The D340R does a very nice job for the money. It would be nice if the camera had more of a zoom feature, but that's probably its only shortcoming.Best results come with the HQ mode. You can save up to 36  pix on 8MB card in the HQ mode. The SHQ mode provides less JPG compression  and a truer image, but the tradeoff is that you can only save 18 images on  an 8 MB card. I haven't noticed any real improvement with the SHQ mode and  -- in my opinion -- the pictures actually look more pixelated in the SHQ  than in the HQ. The JPG compression of the HQ mode smooths the gradients a  bit more, it seems. So HQ mode it is for me on almost every shot. The LQ  mode is only 640x480, and the image quality deteriorates rapidly if you try  to do any zooming or cropping on LQ pictures.I print my photos on an  Epson Stylus Photo 750 printer. In most cases, the output looks to the eye  to be genuine photo quality. As mentioned above, if you try to do blow up  pictures too much -- especially in LQ mode -- the image quality  deteriorates visibly.Battery life has not been a problem for me, but I  use the LCD display as little as possible. I only use it to review pictures  already taken, not to frame or compose shots. I use the viewfinder to  compose. You get a little more in the picture than what you actually see in  the viewfinder, so it's not likely that you'll cut someone's head off in  the picture.I download pictures using the serial cable (included).  Download is rather slow, and it takes several minutes to dump an entire  full camera's worth into the computer. I haven't figured out if there's a  way to select just a few thumbnails off the camera and not download the  whole set of thumbnails. Once you have the thumnails downloaded, though,  you can select only those you want to download for real.The manual is  straightforward and easily understandible, and all the camera controls make  sense once you're up on them. You probably would have a tough time figuring  them out without consulting the manual, though.I hope this is helpful.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this little camera.","Date":"November 27, 1999"}

{"Title":"This is the worst digital camera i have ever seen, EVER.","Author":"Joe Conley \"noevilpeople\"","ReviewID":"RGBHRJAYMGADX","Overall":"bad","Content":"After a family member purchased this Olympus D-340R 1.3 MP camera, i will never again buy any product from olympus.  The first problem about this camera is that it has no zoom.  i cant stand a camera without zoom.  that might be enough to throw it in the trash right off the bat.  But theres more!  This camera eats batteries like crazy.  That is to say you put batteries in, take pictures for 2 minutes, and then it says the batteries are dead and wont let you take any more pictures.  If you take the batteries out, you can use them in another device for hours, but the camera says they are dead.  This seems to happen with only non-rechargeable batteries though, but still, thats another 10, 20$ you have to spend on rechargeable batteries and a charger, plus it takes 4 AA's when it should only take 2.  The camera is also very cheap.  The whole thing is made out of the lowest grade plastics i have ever seen.  If i ever dropped it i am sure it would break.  When you turn the camera on, the display on the back doesnt go on like it should.  The shutter button is often reluctant to snap a photo.  These features make it very hard for me to teach my not-too-savvy family how to use this camera.  The flash also makes pictures come out terrible for some reason, and i always find myself shutting it off to save the photo.  Not that the photos look anything better than terrible without it.  This is a 1.3 MP camera, and a terrible one at that after all.  Now we come to the worst feature, the software.  This is the most poorly designed software anybody could make.  Only a monkey could design software that was any less quality.  First off, IT USES A SERIAL PORT!  That might have been the height of technology in 1985, but anything less than USB is INEXCUSIBLE!  This software is very picky and choosy about when it wants to see that your camera is connected to the computer.  And it takes about 30 seconds to detect if it is.  Then it takes forever to download just a thumbnail of all the images on the camera.  And if you try to transfer more than oh, say, 5 pictures at a time, you risk having the software close on you.  Now this might happen before you wait the 10 hrs it takes to transfer the pictures over the rediculously slow serial port, or after.  I have it happen to me often after the pictures have supposedly transfered, but then the pictures are nowhere to be found on the hard drive, and i have to spend the 30 min re-transferring them.  The people at olympus are obviously not your friends, because i wouldnt wish this digital camera on my enemies.  NEVER BUY THIS CAMERA.  But if you do, spend the extra 20$ to get a smartmedia USB card reader.  It will save you the agony of using the Serial port and the Camedia software, which are both horrible.  Also buy rechargeable batteries, as from what ive seen, all olympuses like to eat batteries like theres no tommorow.  I would just like to emphasize again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY IT, ACCEPT IT AS A GIFT, ANYTHING.  If this camera was free i wouldnt take it. Well i might just to stomp on it 30 times and break it just to save anyone the agony of having to use it.","Date":"January 2, 2003"}

It's not  hard at all to throw a few extras in just in case you need them.  I love  the idea of not having to use any cables or \"special\" programs to  download my pics.  I will say though, I have gotten quite a few pics. that  were of poor quality (fuzzy) and then out of the blue...picture perfect.  I  use a photo program I bought from Walmart for $10, EZPhoto (I used it when  I scanned my \"old\" paper photos) and I normally reduce the size  of my picture A LOT to send quicker through emails.  This camera does have  an email feature though. Quite a few people said that you don't get a very  good quality pic. for printing, but I have to say I disagree.  Maybe the  printer they are using is of poor quality.  I have printed hundreds of  pics. and everyone has enjoyed them and are so surprised they came from a  print off from the digital camera.  One thing that disappointed me about  this camera is...for the $ you spend, you don't get a carrying case.  I  bought a cheap \"purse\" that looks like a camera case and has many  compartments to carry all the extras (battery charger etc.). I spent $6 on  it and it was well worth more than that.  You can't tell it's even a purse.  Another thing, I checked all over..stores and internet and the price of  this camera does not really vary...and if  there's a substantial difference in pricing somewhere..CHECK TO BE SURE  YOU'RE GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGER WITH IT!

The quality of the photos is horrible (mostly due to the .jpg compression) and gives the photo a 'pastel-color' look to it.  The camera does have a setting to take better quality pictures using .BMP capability but when you use this setting you will be able to fit ONLY 1 PHOTO PER FLOPPY DISK.  Although the quality is better when using .BMP it is still not good enough for a serious photographer.  The LCD screen will get fingerprints on it if you even THINK about putting your finger anywhere near it and if you're under strong sunlight it is hard to see the image.  A viewfinder would've come in handy, however.. I like the idea of not having to put the camera up to my face to take a pic.  A necessary evil you might say.  If you DON'T have money to burn, do yourself a favor and either wait until digital cameras are a dime-per-dozen or take out a mortgage loan to save up for the FD-90 Sony model.  I don't know about you, but ...+ is not something I part with easily least of all for a camera.  WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: Online Auctions (Ebay), Unimportant pics.  Also, credit must be given where credit is due: For me, the main selling point of the Sony FD series is disk storage capacity.  This is a definite plus that enables you to share photographs with other people when they dont have a photo-downloading facility in their PC (in my experience this includes one hell of alot of people).  The 10x zoom is also a God-send. You can almost use the camera as binoculars if you want to.  The camera also enables you to format a floppy disk (at the expense of alot of battery life).  A fully charged battery will give u approximately 2.5 hrs of camera use.  In closing;  Get this camera if you truly have your heart set on it, but be forewarned about the day that you are going to want to take the PERFECT PHOTO.  It's not going to happen with the FD73.  Not in the standard .jpg compression it delivers, and not at the 640x480 maximum capacity size.","Date":"November 25, 2000"}

Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more. 2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.  3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.  On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.  But that just doesn't make  up for the weaknesses mentioned  above.  Do your self a favor and get  camera with better resolution - and maybe you'll only have to buy one.  P.S.

{"Title":"eBay Friendly","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RYNFRYODDJRYM","Overall":"good","Content":"I needed a digital camera for listing auctions on eBay. Being that I'm a computer dolt, I sought out the easiest camera to use. The disc feature seemed easiest thus best suited and Consumers' report spoke highly of the camera. My photos are some of the best I've ever seen on eBay and it was a cinch to figure out and use. I have not used many of the bells and whistles, but habitually use the \"bright +/-\" feature: you click that feature a couple of times to compensate for the excesses of natural or man-made light or to get a photo that closer approximates the color of the item photographed. It works miracles and if, in order to closer approximate the color of the object, I end up with a dark photo, my computer software allows me to brighten the image again without distorting the color. Another beneficial characteristic is the clarity of the photos taken from close up. Holding the camera steady is essential. I often need extreme close ups if the object is a war medal or coin or token and get amazing photos by holding the object close to a light in the basement and photographing close up, such that I've got the coin in one hand held toward the basement ceiling and the camera in the other, with the camera between the light and the object so that light hits the object with no shadow. I'm beginning to use this technique for all my close ups of any object. Also, I'm using one of those spiral shaped long-lasting bulbs in the basement, but don't know whether that plays a role in my success with this technique or not. Another great thing about this \"close up\" technique is that I have total control over the light, and can see what image I'm going to get, unlike flash. It is obvious from surfing eBay that most sellers are not savvy to this technique. I sorely wish the camera had a hair trigger though. Especially when I'm doing the basement close up technique, where both hands are over my head and a steady hand is at a premium, yet physically taxing at my age (47), the click button is cumbersome, refusing to respond to gentle suggestion. This problem is distracting, but a small price to pay for the amazing photos that help maximize my sales. This is one great camera.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

BARROW","ReviewID":"R1431CTI14ZOBH","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned this camera for some time, and I couldn't put it down when I first got my battery charged!The Mavica series is a blessing.  The FD-73 is, I recommend, to be used for general purpose shooting.  The absence of a manual focus and poor quality photographs under low-lighting conditions forces me to rate this with only 4 stars instead of 5.  Photos appear too grainy under low-light.The 10x zoom is great.  The included NPF-330 rechargable Lithium battery is a godsend, giving you up to 3 hours of continual use.  Good idea would be to purchase an additional NPF-550 which lasts much longer.  I always keep one in use, and the other on charge.  The batteries will last around two years before they need to be replaced.  These batteries can be used with many other Sony digital cameras and camcorders.My biggest gripe with the FD-73 is it's resolution: JPEG's are only 640x480 in size.  The compression is so-so.  However, the picture effects (sepia, B&W, solarize, negative) are pretty nifty, although I only used the B&W myself.  Similar effects can be achieved using any good graphics program.  The LCD can be very difficult to view while outside under sunny conditions.  Another gripe is the white-balance: you can't control it.  Taking pictures of family against open scenery is difficult, making photographs appear to be back-lit.The controls were easy to manipulate, and the floppy disc can hold anywhere from 1 (if using Bitmap mode) to 20 pictures (depending on image).  Of course, you can fit more images on a disc using B&W mode if you prefer to take black and white photographs.I eventually upgraded to the FD-91, which isn't available on Amazon.com anymore.  As for the FD-73, if you're into quality, go for a better model.","Date":"October 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"Best when you read directions","Author":"Brente R. Blosser","ReviewID":"R3KIXZVRZ1SFEI","Overall":"good","Content":"We have three of these cameras here at work and they are great for the field but most of the users say that they are too limiting.  I found this  not entirely true.  After reading the manual that came with the camera, I  found that you can use one of five special effect settings.  While this is  nice, the main point is that you can also chose exposure settings.  I set  it for action photo and took pictures of my nephews playing basketball.  Not a blurry picture among them.  What was really great was that I gave  each one a copy of the pictures right on the spot by bringing some old  floppies with me.  The nephews made wallpaper out of them for their PC's  and they and their friends think it's great.  While my other friends may  have more expensive cameras, they can't share the pictures right on the  spot.  Great for reunions when you only see friends and families once in a  while.  Instead of promising to e-mail or snail mail pictures, just hand  them a copied disk. Oh, yeah, you can also take a picture of yourself with  the timer feature.  Special Note: As soon as I got the camera out of the  box, I taped a clear piece of plastic over the LCD view screen to protect  it.  I read a previous review which said how easily scratched it can get  and seeing our other cameras here at work, I was not taking any chances.  Guess what? Looks ugly but protects well.  Thanks for the info from the  previous review.","Date":"August 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"a good start","Author":"C. Williams","ReviewID":"R25TTHP5ACGX0V","Overall":"good","Content":"I use this camera at work and post the pictures on the company's intranet site. The floppy disks are very convienent for inter-office exchanges, and  it is not difficult to carry around a few extra floppies when you're on the  move and want to take a lot of pictures. I had no trouble at all learning  how to use the camera and had taken a picture, imported it onto my  computer, and posted it on the internet in about 5 - 10 minutes. It is  pretty durable too - I dropped it off the back of a speeding golf cart and  it was fine afterwards (phew).  However, as time went on, I found the  picture quality average at best. The camera does not take reliable shots,  and the quality can vary from excellent to extremely poor. I know how to  use a camera and how to take what should be a good shot, but too often the  pictures end up fuzzy or over/under exposed. I can get better quality  taking non-digital pictures and scanning them in (although this takes  considerably longer). Also - the zoom feature is useful, but like many  zooms, does not quite provide a focused shot. My advice: if you're  just starting out and looking for a quick and very easy way to take digital  pictures, this camera is a good choice. If you have any experience with  digital cameras or even a regular 35mm, look to spend a little bit more,  and get a lot more quality for your money. You may lose that 10x zoom and  some of the easy-to-use features, but I think it is worth the sacrifice.","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

{"Title":"Versatile and Convenient","Author":"J. Rex","ReviewID":"R3P7AA0KXEGNN9","Overall":"good","Content":"The convenience of floppy disks is hard to beat. No proprietary cables or special setup is required. Even the newer cameras with the USB interface often require their own goofy PhotoSchmuck software to be installed. The  floppy drive enables us to share our pics at any time, even with friends  that have older computers or (God forbid) a Mac. Almost any computer can  read the format-standard JPEG used by the Mavica cameras. You can even dupe  a disk in the middle of nowhere. Try that with a smart card! If you want to  make a living with artful photography look higher up the line, or at the  Olympus 600.

Mostly I was concerned about the pic quality, but decided to get it anyway. It has two main modes: standard and email. Both modes produce fairly good quality  pics, perhaps not suitable for editing, but great for standard utility  shots to send to friends or use in online auctions. It takes the best pics  when the object is well lit; pics are sometimes grainy when taken indoors  with low light. Overall, I'd say that this camera offers what most people  need in a digital camera and I am glad that I didn't spend more. The pics  are high quality, the camera is easy to use, has very high battery life and  lots of functionality. Tip: buy a camera case right away.","Date":"March 12, 2000"}

Features are the descriptions listed by the manufacturer. Benefits are how using the product makes you feel. This camera makes me happy!  It's not a 35mm, but I own one of  those and it spends most of its time in the camera bag.  My SonyMav,  though, I want to take *everywhere* for the kick of capturing even the most  familiar and mundane scenes or objects in a new perspective.  I can see the  results instantly. I'm not stuck paying for bad shots and if I decide later  on that I really don't like a picture I can delete it and re-use its space.  I can share pix instantly by copying the diskette on the spot or later on,  by sending pix via email or posting them on the Internet.  Look at the FD73  pictures that are out there on the 'net (we're a proud and happy bunch,  wanting to put 'em all out there on our websites)-- they're breathtaking!  A missing feature of this camera, an LCD sun shield, can be made or  purchased inexpensively, as can a scratch guard.  The benefit of having an  LCD viewfinder means you can extend your arms and put the camera places  where you can't or wouldn't want to place your face.  You can take candid  photos without anyone realizing what you're up to because you're holding  the camera down, at or below chest level like you're just checking on  it.As to the features: read them, do your homework on the Internet and  you'll know what you're going to get, including the limitations and  problems.  Delve into it and you'll find out how to overcome those problems  and make the best of the limitations.  Check your wallet, weigh your  options, decide what you want.

The advantages are great macros (down to 1\"),10X zoom lens, comes with rechagable battery and charger, simple downloading of floppies to your PC and the economy of using floppies as the storage medium.

If I want to blow up my pictures to 16X20, I use my 35mm SLR.  Megapixel cameras do take better pictures but they require EXPENSIVE memory cards.  The camera takes great shots for web sites and email.  If you shop around, floppies cost almost nothing.  With a rebate, I bought 100 floppies.  I put 10 of them in a bag and I took over 200 photos. (It would have cost me hundreds of dollars to save that many pictures on memory cards.) They used up less room than two rolls of film.  The recharable battery lasts forever and I can go out and take hundreds of photos without having to dump the memory card.  Achiving the photos uses little disk space on my hard drive.  The camera is very easy to use and in the long run pays for itself on the savings on film development, batteries or extra memory.  I give copies of disks right on the spot and the camera is very reliable. If you are looking for a good \"snapshot\" camera, this is a good one.  The other reviews mention the good and bad points of the camera so there is no need to mention them again.  This is a great camera for real estate or onsite documentation and great for the 100000000 pictures of the baby or the family picnic.  It's a fun, simple and easy to use camera.

{"Title":"Good, not great","Author":"Tracy Rowan \"dargelos\"","ReviewID":"R30DGHBU32S0IR","Overall":"good","Content":"For entry level digital photography, you could do far worse than the Mavica.  What sold me initially, aside from the very reasonable price, was that it used floppy discs instead of internal storage.  What this means is that if you have a pocket full of discs you can take pictures all day without ever having to download to your PC.  It also means you don't have to worry about a free parallel, serial or USB port, which, if you're a peripheral junkie like me, is reason enough to give serious consideration to this camera.On the downside - yes, there is one - the resolution is not what you might hope for.  When used at normal size, the pics are fine, not great.  They're useable.  When you try to increase the size to 5x7 or 8x10, the results are disastrous.  The other downside is that the flash will frequently wash out the entire picture, but the camera does not function well indoors with available light.  You really have to fiddle with your settings to get this right.  Sometimes it's just not possible.So, do I recommend this camera?  Yes, with reservations.  If you're looking for high quality output and you have the bucks to spare, then look elsewhere.  But if you want a decent camera for a reasonable price, particularly for outdoor use, check out the Mavica.","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

I write and edit a newsletter for a state agency and am often asked to take photos at award programs and/or to accompany job announcements, often with almost no prior notice.Of all the cameras I looked at in the 1990s, this was the one that best suited my needs. The reasons for that follow:1. Shooting photos on a diskette was easier than engaging software and changing documentation from the camera to a file on my PC.2. The 10X zoom is very accurate and allowed me to do adequate work even when I could not get close to my subject.3. The camera is flat out easy to use and has a large viewfinder, a large left hand grip, and big button to press when shooting pictures.Before I bought this camera, I worked for three decades for newspapers and in communications offices of governmental and nonprofit agencies doing the same kind of work I do now. In all those years I never used a camera that was as easy to use as this one, nor did I use one where transmitting the product from the equipment to e-file was easier.Having said that, this is a low resolution camera that will not always give good results. It is adequate for head shots and has always come through for me in events.But I've taken photos of my cats at home where their eyes look more like diamonds than eyes, and I took some pictures of the Christmas tree where the lights looked more like the stars or snowflakes than lights on a tree.So don't buy this to create award-winning photography. For all the same reasons, it doesn't produce very good hardcopy photos.But this is a great camera for someone that needs to take pictures right now and get an adequate product online fast. That's my mission at work and this camera has always helped me achieve it.In addition, the battery charger works fast and I've never had to pay a dime to get anything fixed in more than a half-decade of use. I don't know how this stacks up in the camera industry but it's a lot better than most of the electronic equipment I use in the office or at home.","Date":"August 23, 2005"}

The fact that it uses standard floppy disks, instead of memory cards or downloading.  This makes it increadibly flexable.  I am very bad about developing film, and this format makes it  easy. Also, if I take a bad picture I can preview and zap it right there.  I took some pictures of my 4 month old son, that I would not have gotten  with a conventional camera.  By the way, it can be really heavy if you wear  it around your neck for a long period of time.  The battery life is  pretty good as long as I keep it off until I am ready to take a series of  pictures.  Also, to my surprise, it takes great high speed.  I took a  picture of a race car at full speed, that was beautiful.  I have,  however, dropped it once. It killed a couple of my pictures, but I expected  that with a floppy device.  The camera itself is fine.  One added bonus  is the battery is exactly the same as my Sony Handycam Camcorder.  Not only  do I have a extra battery now for both, but the included battery charger  charges both quickly and easily.

Don't be repulsed by other reviewers who doesn't know how to use the camera, just go to your nearby retailer store and look at it yourself. It is in some ways  over-priced due to the zoom and floppy drive; a 10x zoom (optical) with a  640x480 is better than a 6x zoom(2x optical and 3x digital) with 1280x960.  I don't like it when people compare these kind of cameras to other kinds at  the same or lower price using flash cards or smart media, because there are  different essentiel accessories that aren't included in those prices(the  compact flash cards could make you say \"Aaaarrrrrggghhhh! I don't have  enough because I spent every penny on the camera!\").At the end,  this camera still has problems with the quality of the pictures, but it  comes cheaper than other cameras. If you have a lot of money to invest,  don't buy this one, just buy the best camera with the best lens and don't  look at lower priced items, because quality is what you want.Last thing  to say to whom never touched a digital camera, you must know how the camera  works and how and when it take good or even excellent  pictures.Congratulations to those who bought mavicas(me!)!","Date":"July 9, 2000"}

No, it is not the best, most fully-featured digital camera on the market.  But it must surely be the simplest to use, with a price-to-quality ratio  that's off the scale. I had become increasingly concerned that life's  everyday events were passing me by unrecorded--you know the kind of events  that one might like to look back on, but that are simply not worth the  hassle and expense of traditional film processing. This camera is a  Recorder of Life. Light, simple, and good quality pictures. The rechargable  battery lives long, and floppy discs make archiving so easy.  A must-have!","Date":"November 4, 1999"}

Only a few drawbacks.","Author":"Pinchas Bar-Zeev","ReviewID":"R372QKHL9NKXV1","Overall":"good","Content":"As this is my first digicam, I bought the FD73 for its price, simplicity, ease of use, unique diskette storage and large 2.5\" LCD screen. I'm not disappointed, to say the least! On my large 20\" computer screen the \"Normal\" mode\" images look just \"Fine\"! Even after severely cropping images, they remain remarkably sharp. Love the 10x zoom. Indoors and outdoors out of the sun the LCD screen is great. In \"Normal\" mode I make an average of 25 pictures per diskette.On the down side, I miss the time exposure option. The LCD screen is weak under sunlight. Suggestion: Try positioning yourself in a shaded area. The 120 min. battery empties much faster than that! Avoid battery drainage by turning off the beep and not using the image management menu (deletion, copying, formatting, etc.). The user manual doesn't provide much details about camera specifications.","Date":"September 18, 2001"}

When it was brand new, my wife got hit by a wave at the tip of Cabo San Lucas with the camera around her neck.  The camera was in a case but the wave was so strong, water and sand actually got in the camera.  We dried it out and it didn't affect camera function at all.  That was a huge relief because three years ago this camera sold for $500.  I use it at work a lot to take pictures at office functions.  Everyone is amazed I can pop the disc in any computer and email or print the pictures instantly.  I have used it on vacations outside the US in Internet Cafe's to email pictures home.  It's best features are it's so easy to use and you can view the pictures on any computer anywhere in the world simply by inserting the floppy disc.  The only problem I have had with the camera is getting consistent picture quality in very light or very dark settings.  That may be operator error but after three years it still happens.  I have looked at upgrading to a MVC with more megapixels but I have learned for each feature you add you lose some of the simplicity of the FD73.","Date":"October 4, 2003"}

(And I bought the camera at an on-line auction site for an excellent price, so it's an even better bargain!)  I am even pleased with the quality of the printed-out pictures; I've noticed that the quality of the photos improve if I edit the pictures down to a smaller size (my computer's pre-loaded photo software program will do this.)  It's important to remember that, if a shot doesn't come out perfectly, you can always view it through the LCD display, delete it, and re-take the shot.

The adapter for the battery plug  had rolled over to a corner of the box and I couldn't find it until I  started to put everything back in the box...even tho there were 10  instruction books in every language, the English language directions were  vague and you had to use your own computer savvy to know how to  \"format\" your floppys, plus there wasn't a warranty card  enclosed, but I contacted Sony via email and received one in the mail.

The convenience of being able to use 3 1/2\" discs as your storage media is worth a lot.  The zoom and macro capability is excellent.  Having said that, the picture quality is acceptable for snapshots, email, and auction sites, but is a far cry from photo quality.  The images get very grainy in low light, and are quite pixelated if enlarged at all.  Reflections and very bright spots are not handled well...light to dark transitions are coarse.  You'll be able to get decent prints up to about 5X7, but beyond that things start to get a bit fuzzy.

{"Title":"Works out pretty well, but not always","Author":"Zagnorch","ReviewID":"R3KVDBMXDU2LPO","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been using this particular model for three years. I use it mainly to take pics of the various items I sell on eBay, and I've found it to be fairly reliable, although the picture quality & resolution isn't always consistent. Some of my photos will be reasonably crisp & clear; others will be a bit muddy. Of course, this could just be due to a lack of photography skills on my part, since my parents also own one of these, and their photos consistently come out nice and clear. They use theirs to take reference pics and event photos for the various organizations they're involved in.The Mavica MVC-73 is okay for taking outdoor & social function pics so long as the place being photographed is reasonably well-lit, and the proper picture-type settings are being used. Unfortunately, the flash function for darker occasions isn't all that hot. It throws a bit too much light on the subject(s), and has a limited range of about eight feet (approx. 2.5 meters). Beyond that, you might as well have taken the pic without the flash at all.The camera also features a playback mode, where you can review the previous pics in the disc. It's a good thing to have in case you're not sure if the last snap you took came out well or not. In my case, usually not! Another nice feature is the auto shut-off, which kicks in after about two minutes of disuse. Although the battery is stated to last for up to 2.5 hours, I've never gotten more than an hour and 50 minutes from a ful charge. Never the less, a `full' cell will usually last me a week or so, since I don't use it too much. One somewhat inconvenient thing about the battery, though: you have to remove it to recharge it, instead of just plugging it directly into an AC adapter/charger. And even though the storage on 3.5 inch disks is convenient in one sense (I can download the pics from the disk into the hard drive faster), the limited capacity of the disk can be a problem. At most, I can get 18 images onto one floppy.Oh, and one last thing. I know this sounds a bit clich, but do remember to remove the lens cap before trying to photograph something! I've had times when I'd turn my camera on, and the view screen would be completely dark, when it should've been showing whatever the lens was aimed at! Speaking of the lens cap, it's attached to the neckstrap by a small cord. Although it has a small clip on it to hook onto the neckstrap, it never stays on! This isn't so bad if you're clickin' pics at the normal angle & elevation, but when you're shooting snaps of things on the ground below you like I do, that dangling cover in the frame can be a real pain!`Late","Date":"January 30, 2002"}

Chapman \"bnio\"","ReviewID":"R1K7DZG5EH0NO5","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera was a gift to me by my parents before I set off to study abroad in Japan three years ago.  It was given to me with the promise that I would email photos back home on a frequent basis.  Since then I have spent two years in Japan and have taken over 12,000 photos with the Mavica.  It is extremely durable -- I have dropped it at least a half-dozen times from a standing height, and has been exposed to mist and humidity countless times -- and it still functions perfectly to this day.  The function of the floppy disk easily makes it the most convenient camera for email and quick uploading.  Though because of the size it is to accommodate the floppy disk, the camera is a little on the bulky size.  And the zoom is incredible!  The 10x optical zoom is still the function that has most impressed people who have seen the photos I have taken.  Yes, the camera has poor picture resolution compared to most cameras on the market, and it has been the one function that has frustrated me when I wish to take detailed photos, but the camera has served me well; a great rough and tumble digital camera.  Ultra convenient and superb in LCD viewing with quality and speed (most cameras have a jerky reaction to movement when viewing, not this camera), this is a perfect camera for a person new to digital cameras or needs one for quick and snappy photography.

I took 14 photographs, they had to be indoors as it was dark outside. Cats and dogs were  most unco-operative, but eventually I had enough pix to work on and transfered them into the computer, re-sized added captions and printed them out. I found the camera very easy to use. It was very quick and easy to transfer the photos from the floppy to my hard drive, and the results were pretty good, seeing as I had not even bothered to read the instruction manual. I did have problems with red-eye, which I could have corrected if I had not been in such a hurry. The photo resolution is not as good as on my Kodak camera, but for beginners and certainly for children, it was good enough. I liked the fact it was easy to use and had various diferent modes, the Fine Art one was good, I have a lovely \"Impressionist\" type photograph of my blue Burmese cat. If you want a camera that is fast and easy, as a starter kit, this seems to be a good buy. ... , but we always seem to have to pay more on this side of the pond than you lucky folks in USA !

{"Title":"Thumbs Up","Author":"Deborah A. Woehr","ReviewID":"RUYYFWJVGQYD5","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my introduction to the digital camera.  So far, I'm very pleased with the results.  The Mavica is programmed with five picture formats: Fine, Sepia, B&W, Negative Art, and Solarize.  It is easy to use, even for the beginner.  I disagree with some of the reviewers regarding its size.  I was able to shove it in my purse when I wasn't using it; however, for the price, I would've liked to see it come with an extra battery and a carrying case.  It does come with a shoulder strap, which isn't uncomfortable. The camera has zoom capability, but I found that you have to be careful with blurring.  I don't fault the camera, but the photographer.  I have had some experience with blurred pictures and red-eyes.  Photo-enhancing software such as PhotoShop will take care of that.  I know because I've tried. The Mavica works well with Macs and PCs.  The only problem I came across was sending the pictures after editing them with PhotoShop.  If your mother doesn't have the same software that you do, then you will have to send that blurry or red-eyed picture of Junior.  Oh, well. I like this camera, but if I win the lottery someday, I will go out and buy a CD camera because of the memory constraints that these floppy-based cameras have.","Date":"February 3, 2001"}

{"Title":"Good but not perfect","Author":"A. Ball","ReviewID":"R31UI7NBD4CRBV","Overall":"good","Content":"Since I bought this camera in July, I have run over 800 exposures through it.  The Coolpix 950 takes some getting used to and the manuals are required reading, but this is a camera worth learning how to use. There are  two manuals, one printed and one on CD-ROM, plus the Getting Started sheet.  You need to look at all three; each contains information not present in  the other documents.The macro capability is phenomenal.  I have a  picture of a dime that fills most of the frame.  The ability to push the  sensitivity of the CCD to ISO 400 and to overexpose by up to two f/stops  allows even night pictures by available street light.  The enhanced speed  (at some cost in picture quality) also allows candids by available light.  The Coolpix is also quiet in operation, even quieter if you shut off the  discreet beeper that tells you that you have taken a shot.On the down  side, you will have to spring for rechargeable batteries.  I have gotten by  so far with NiCd batteries plus a fast recharger.  A ribbon on your lens  cap is also highly recommended.  I have also been having some trouble  lately with my off-record-play switch, and there is some barrel distortion  and color fringing in the lens at its wide-angle setting.  The lens' focus  at its landscape setting also seems a little questionable at high  magnification.  I also wish that the manual focus settings weren't so  coarse and that it were possible to do a completely manual exposure.  (You  can set either the shutter speed or the aperture manually, but not both  simultaneously.)  There is a noticeable delay between pushing the button  and actually getting an exposure.  This is sometimes a problem for candids  and sports photography and when working with animals, but I have still  gotten successful pictures in all these categories, and the Coolpix is  faster than most digital cameras in this respect.Other than these few  small problems, I am happy with the quality of the pictures I have been  getting, and it is small enough for me to carry on my belt for instant  access.  I could never carry a standard 35 mm camera with similar  capability around like that.  The Coolpix seems to be holding up well  mechanically, even though it gets bumped now and again.  (The extra  batteries do get a little lumpy when I sit down, though!)","Date":"November 17, 1999"}

The Coolpix 950 is my second digital. It's truly one of the greats with plenty of creative features. The macros are impressive, with distances less than an  inch. The Coolpix requires lots of time understanding the many buttons,  wheels and software driven features. It seems to me that the Nikon computer  people and their mechanical people could have made it easier for the user.  The available user instructions from Nikon, including their CD ROM  versions, could have been much better designed, even for old photography  buffs. Their technical service phone number is a toll call and I got busy  signals THREE times even after I connected with their menu-driven answering  machine. Their website tech help is very good, but not if you are in a  hurry. The camera is a major user of power so you will need long lasting  batteries like NiMH. I bought a rechargable ProPower Pack from Unity  Digital for $100 that lasts a considerable time. I'd rate the camera itself  a 5-star and the support and user help a 3-star, for an average of 4-stars.","Date":"November 25, 1999"}

I email pictures to family regularly.  The quality is matchless, but I have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over 1 meg. The quality is so exquisite, that (get this) got a  color matched fabric from a friend in NY based on a close up picture I took  of a printed upholstery piece.  I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.  I even dropped one on the grass  and was unable to find it right after dropping it.  I now have 6, having  asked everyone I know for one for presents.","Date":"December 2, 1999"}
{"Title":"Trying to decide? Get a Nikon 950!","Author":"College Professor","ReviewID":"RZ08SV56MF08S","Overall":"good","Content":"Background: I have had a 35mm SLR camera for years and was a weekend photographer. I knew  that to quicker exposure times on bright days, that I needed to turn the f-stop to a higher number, for  example. I took time exposures by mounting the camera on a tripod  with a remote shutter release...I  knew some times, but was  hardly a professional! Basic stuff.  I spent about 4 weeks  reading every review I could find on 2 megapixel digital cameras. It came  down to several options.  First, several  people tried to convince me to get a Kodak DC280 running about $400. I  didn't.  Why? Because it offers very little manual control  over the camera and Kodak appears to oversaturate  the colors  too much.  Second, I looked at the Nikon Coolpix 800 for  about $400 too. I didn't get it. I went to Best Buy's  several times a week and played with the CP800. The picture quality is  fantastic (see some of the  review websites), but it only had  a 2X zoom and offered manual focusing. It did not allow shutter or  apeture priority.  Third, I decided on the Nikon 950.  I missed out on some of the lowest prices on this back in  Mid-April, but found I could get it from Amazon.com for about $570 after  rebate. I avoided some of  the online stores with bad ratings  on the resellerratings.com website.  Why the 950? Well, I  have had it for about 5 days now and KNOW I made the right choice. Out of  the bag, it takes great pictures under an amazing list of  situations in automatic mode. But...there is  so much  more!  Yesterday, I took it with me to my son's soccer  game. I wanted to take some action shots. In  automatic mode,  all action was blurred. :-( But, I put the 950 into shutter priority mode,  set it to take  pictures at 1/500th of a second (it was  bright daylight), and all action is stop-action. It's great!  I've also used it to take pictures of the moon by placing the 950 on a  tripod and positioning the lens  against my telescope  eyepiece. I used shutter priority mode with exposures of 1/30, 1/60, and  1/125  of a second again. Pictures are stunning. I would not  have been able to do this with the 800 or the  Kodak.  How to get pictures into the computer? If you have a laptop with a  PC card slot, buy a compact flash  adapter for about $10. If  you have a computer with a USB port, buy a compact flash reader to plug  into it (I got mine for about $25). It allows 8MB of pictures to  be transferred to the computer in  about 10 seconds. No  waiting an hour for them to come over the serial port for me!  If you can afford to get the 950, do so. Also try to get some  rechargeable batteries, a compact flash  reader and a bigger  compact flash card.   Strengths: Great pictures in  automatic mode. Ability to set the shutter speed. Good zoom.  Weaknesses: Buy a NIMH charger and some NIMH batteries (there are places  that sell these on ebay  fairly cheap...I got 12 of these  1500Mah for $22). The included 8MB compactflash card is small.  Buy a bigger one. Similar Products Used: Have had a Quicktake 150 and a  Kodak DC50.","Date":"May 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Buy one!  But you can't buy mine!","Author":"PT Phil \"bajaphil\"","ReviewID":"R2M8TMAE721DWX","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is the digital equivalent to a some of the fine utility film cameras such as Canons' Rebel and lan EOS series: The camera is just as complex as you need it to be - whether you are a `point-and-shoot' user or  a need it for professional uses.  In my design business use it has far  exceeded my expectations.Prior to purchasing the 950, I would  take a product shot, make a print and tape it onto my monitor where I used  it as reference to draw the product into an on screen graphic.  With this  camera, I seldom print the `film' out at all - in fact in many cases I  didn't even have to redraw the product in at all.  A shade-tree calculation  says that this camera has saved me well over 100 hours in the three months  I have owned it.  Even at my low-low rates this is several times the cost  of this camera - even including the optional memory. The  resolution is high enough for everyday publication uses -- print or pixel.  A caveat here: the lens does not collect enough light to do studio quality  photography.  For this reason in most high quality still photo work it is  useful to use a tripod to keep the camera steady.  The `speed' of the  camera is roughly equivalent to ASA 100 film.While it takes  only a few moments to discover the basics for `point-and-shoot' mode it is  worth a few hours practice in the `pro' mode.  Few of the `advanced'  features are really difficult to understand and using them once or twice is  so rewarding that learning becomes an easy and fun process - especially  since you can erase the film and use it over!  With careful lighting I  can come very close to studio quality work which compares to my yeoman  Canon EOS lan 35mm. Particularly handy for me is the macro  mode - or close-up mode.  You can focus from less than an inch!  I  sometimes use it over my high-test scanner for documents because it is  easier and faster.  My partner (whose mechanical ability allows the use of  the toaster correctly 7 out of 10 times) uses it for online auctions and  has found it to be a blessing: she no longer shuns putting up the low cost  items due to the difficulty of getting an image.  She is still using the  point and shoot modes but they are more than good enough for this use. Notes and recommendations: Even a casual user will find the  need to have more than the supplied 8-megabyte chip.  I have a 64 and it is  more than enough.  Probably an additional  8- or 16-megabyte would do for  average use.  Uploading pictures using what is in the box is  straightforward but cumbersome and requires a serial port.  For not too  much money you can get a serial or USB drive that makes the CompactFlash  chip into a drive - plug the chip in and using explorer or your photo  software you can retrieve your photos just like any file on your computer.  (We have even used it to move non-photo programs from one `puter to  another!)  Please note that I have skipped over many features which have  bee covered admirably by the other reviewers on this page.In  this fast-moving technological era it is difficult to make a decision to  buy as there is another camera coming out in the near future.  However,  this camera will work for me for a long time and I recommend it to anyone  from the family album user to photo professionals for everyday use.  With  the new online services that will make you paper prints from your uploaded  images there are fewer and fewer reasons for cumbersome film and this  camera is one of the first to deliver print-quality resolution.","Date":"January 13, 2000"}

{"Title":"A Great Digital Camera","Author":"Bibliophile","ReviewID":"R3TNG50AT288F6","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought a Nikon Coolpix (my first digital camera) about a six months ago and am very satisfied with it.  Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM \"point-and-shoot\" camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures \"on-the-fly\", etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  \"keepers\" on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that, given the  recent price reductions, I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.","Date":"May 24, 2000"}
{"Title":"Best Digital Camera Going","Author":"Thomas R. Jones \"tomjones1\"","ReviewID":"R3UFHFQIJUCD0J","Overall":"good","Content":"I've owned my Coolpix 950 for over six months now, and it was one of the best investments I've made.  The imaging is astounding.  I could read the numbers on football players on a T.V. in the background, of a dimly lit  bar.  I read the reviews in P.C. Mag which said if you want 35mm quality  you had to have a camera with 2.1 megapixels, but this baby exceeds the  quality of a 35mm.  Two things though, The software leaves a lot to be  desired, and the flash ram is way to small if you want high quality  pictures in any quantity.  The 8 megabyte flash ram that comes with the  camera will give you 8 high quality pictures.  But if you boost it (we  bought an  80 megabyte flash ram by SanDisk which is totally compatible)  you'll be able to take more pictures than you'll ever need or want.  We  went to Paris in June and took over 300 pictures (high quality), and the  Camera still had a couple of hundred left.  You probably don't need the 80  megabyte, but I think you would want the 32 megabyte.Also, while your at  it get yourself some AA rechargeable batteries (also high quality), because  you'll go through AA's like they are  going out of style.  People love to  see what you have taken in the little LCD screen and it really chews up the  batteries.  Also, the flash will use them up! If your going to use this as  a web publishing tool you couldn't find a better one.  I recommend that you  use a real digital imaging tool like Photoshop, or MS Imaging.  The flash  gives most people red eyes (real evil looking) and you'll need to brush  that out with a good imaging tool.  Also, you can magnify your images 2 or  3X's and not lose quality, and with a good imaging tool you can crop it,  lighten, darken, change color, and make thumbnails with a couple of clicks.  Hint:  Nikon View is cumberson to work with but you can speed up the  downloading by using it away from your browser. Load direct from file,  instead of from file open from browser then you can choose from the  thumbnails (right click the thumbnail, choose copy)then paste it into  Word,Powerpoint or Photoshop.  If you use Powerpoint, you have a built in  slide show.  Good Luck!...you'll love it!","Date":"December 23, 1999"}

He loves the CoolPix950 with the advanced mode, I use it with the auto mode for now.  Either way we get great pictures, especially with  the option to delete and a 32mb Compact Flash card.  To print photos, we  bought the Olympus printer that Amazon \"recommends\" and found it  to be small and flimsy.  We returned it (as always a good Amazon return  experience!) and bought the HP PhotoSmart P1100 with duplexer.  The best  thing about this printer is that you can just pop the Compact Flash card  out of the camera and pop it into the printer, and HP's software is FAR  superior to the Nikon junk that comes with the CoolPix.  A few annoying  features: (1) the delay between when you press the shutter button and when  the camera finally takes the photo. Hard to get used to when trying to  photograph your two-year-old offering his stuffed Pooh a drink from his  sippy cup (2) the flash is too close to the lens and everything with  eyeballs turns red!

The Mavica was easy to use, but limited. The Coolpix is extremely flexible and can work well if you have the time to carefully adjust the proper settings.  Unfortunately it takes some time to be able to understand enough about the  settings to use them correctly. These are often a strange mix of software  and hardware settings. You can't be in a hurry to take a picture with this  camera.  Another negative is the considerable use of energy needed to take  the highest resolution photos. The 950 sucks energy from my NiMH batteries  at a surprisingly high rate. I bought a backup rechargable battery pack and  it goes fast too. On the plus side, the photos are great and the macro gets  you less than one half inch from the subject. I consider the camera pricey  and a bit quirky.

This camera is teriffic and the price has  really come down in 9 months. By the way get as large a memory card as you  can afford because you will be taking many more pictures with this camera  than you ever did with a film camera. I can't recommend it highly enough.","Date":"April 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great!","Author":"P. W. Sheehan \"pwsheehan\"","ReviewID":"R1FC1KJ9NJ2S0U","Overall":"good","Content":"Great camera once you learn the menus and buttons. Advanced users of electronic cameras will find this easy. I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a \"speed rating\" of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images. You'll also need access to a good, fast  color printer to print out the full reference manual. A copy center such as  Kinko's should work. This is not a camera for the \"instamatic\"  crowd. Hint: negative reviewers tend to be disappointed because it is not  an out-of-the-box instant hit, but with a little creative work, the camera  does well. I may trade up to the CoolPix 990 in a year or two after the  price comes down.","Date":"February 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon 950 Recommendations","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R21VVBF1F2HBL6","Overall":"good","Content":"There's no need to repeat all the wonderful things about this camera. It's great! However, I would like to make the following recommendations.1) Get a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH batteries rated at 1500mah. The  alkalines I first used were good for about an hour. With the NiMH  batteries, I'm still shooting with the same batteries after more than 120  pictures, with no sign of drainage. Don't settle for the cheaper 600mah  NiMH batteries, spend the extra money and get the 1500mah rating. Also, I  recommend NiMH rather than NiCd, as the later is less environmentally  friendly. Radio Shack is selling a set of 4AA NiMH 1300mah batteries plus a  charging unit for $1 more than the price of the batteries alone. If you get  this, plus an extra set of 1500mah NiMH, you'll be all set.2) Get a 6VDC  800ma adapter, for use when downloading pictures to your computer. It will  give you a lot longer battery life. By the way you don't need the 6.5V  adapter Nikon recommends. 3) Don't use the LCD screen more than you have  to when running off batteries. Program the camera to keep the LCD screen  off by default. This can be done in M-REC mode. As far as I can tell M-REC  mode does everything A-REC mode does (including automatic focus and flash),  except A-REC mode forces the LCD screen on, so learn how to use the camera  and stay with M-REC. By the way, a quick peek at the LCD every now and then  is okay with the NiMH batteries, but don't leave the LCD on any longer than  you have to.4) Don't change picture resolutions unless the memory card  is empty. I've lost pictures doing this. If you want to shoot at a  different resolution, save the pictures first, then clear the memory card  and go from there.If you follow these suggestions, you'll find the  batteries last a LONG time, and you'll always take great pictures.Enjoy!","Date":"June 12, 2000"}
{"Title":"High Cost - Disappointing Outcome","Author":"Chicago Resident","ReviewID":"R1UKJTVAL9F29X","Overall":"bad","Content":"Purchased and returned the camera.  From an optical perspective and the quality of the images, quite a great camera. Considering the substantial cost, several items were very disappointing and caused me to return it on a  cost vs. benefit aspect:  1) The camera does not come with a recharger and  appropriate NiCad (or better) batteries. Regular alkaline batteries last  about 30 min. for normal use.  2) The connection to the PC requires a  serial port only. Would be a nice option to include USB hookup. My  computer's serial ports are all used for other devices.  3) An 8MB flash  card that holds a mere 16 images in the 'normal' mode. 4) When connected to  the PC, the pictures cannot be easily transferred to software programs that  can sort, package or send the pictures.  A cumbersome copy procedure has to  be utilized to get the pictures on the hard drive; from there they need to  be imported to the software. Even with a 450 Pentium II machine, the  transfer was slow (even at the fasted speed setting for the serial port).  The instructions confirmed that photo software does not recognize the  camera as a device to copy from.  It should work just like a scanner (from  a system's perspective).I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another $200+ would have to be  invested. (Batteries, charger and larger flash card) The PC hook-up could  be greatly improved and made more user friendly.  Considering the already  high cost this is not yet a good package. I was sorry to return it.","Date":"January 13, 2000"}

Price is a little steep, but quality outways the difference in price from competitors. the 950 will  download 40 pix shot in Fine mode from Simple Technologies cardreader to a  G4 in 11 seconds. It's a battery hog I recommend buying Energizer's NH15-AA  instead of Duracell Ultra. I shot 150 pix in the fine mode 46 of them using  the flash until they were depleted.  It's ideal for Web publishing, however  I shot several photos for magazine use and the results were  non-distinguishable compared to film. If your a tweekhead you will spend  hours trying different traditional photo techniques with this camera and  your results will be quite surprising. Some of my favorites are Slow  Shutter Sync, 8 second time exposure, and a very accurate white balance  that is crucial when shooting in mixed lighting situations.

{"Title":"Check the 990 model before purchasing","Author":"James Bradley","ReviewID":"R2KU225ZSDUZ4O","Overall":"good","Content":"Amazon's review still touts this as a \"top of the line\" camera when Nikon released the third generation CoolPix 990 months ago. The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 (shown here).  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 (3.34 Megapixels). It's a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive, and if you don't need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as \"top of the  line.\"The swiveling body on the 900, 950, and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down, or at your knees  with the lens looking up, and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display, because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras don't do this and it's really useful. It's  made possible by the fact that these cameras (especially the 990) are so  good at autofocus, autoexposure, and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot, not worry about  anything else, and get a great result.","Date":"August 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"GOOD: Image quality. BAD: No USB, distortion at wide angle.","Author":"Spiff","ReviewID":"R1MMP7CJFGDI78","Overall":"good","Content":"I own the 950 since the first days when it was launched. Since it is a product with many reviews, I will perhaps focus on a few positive and negative aspects I have found over this time.For positive, well, overall image quality is very good, colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes, you will still need your Photoshop, but in any case, even with high-end professional models, you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photo-quality A4 (I'm in Europe, that's about the area of a 17\" monitor) prints that people will mistake for normal photos (matched with a good printer of course). The firmware is very effective, but a few features have been improved in the 990, which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me, you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldn't work as good. My favorite aspect has to be the absolutely AMAZING macro mode. The 950 can focus sharply at a ridiculously small distance from the subject. This thing is almost a microscope. Yes, it can be tricky to adjust lightning in those cases, but the ability to focus so well at such distances really impressed me when this model came out. So to keep it short, I'm happy when it comes to overall image quality, color accuracy, and features the main problems with this model are:-Considerable barrel distortion at wide angle. If you do a lot of architectural photos or are just unlucky and pick a tricky shot (like a door for instance) at the edges of the screen, at wide angle, well, it is way too obvious sometimes. Few digital cameras offer high-quality lens that are completely (almost) barrel distortion free, but I can't help looking at some cheap digicams using Zeiss lenses and feeling that the Coolpix deserved better. At Tele, the problem is a lot less obvious, but on wide, expect some of your lines to be more like,well...splines. -No USB interface, no Firewire, no nothing besides the plain' old serial interface. Ever tried transferring 48MB at 115k? Well, let's just say that it reminds me the days when I used analog modems. A lot of patience is required. Again, this could and should have been released with USB support (which was widely available at the time).  -Big body. The camera is a big big, not cigarrete-packet size like some Canon's and other models, so, that might end up meaning that you'll take it with you less often. -Some chromatic distortion (purple edges, etc) under certain conditions.  -Forget about using Alkalines they will last 10 minutes. Go for NiMh 1600 rechargeables. The 8MB default card will only hold about 10 photos at maximum resolution, or 1 if you don't want lossy compression. 48 MB or 64 MB cards are essential. -Panel isn't always visible under bright sunlight (newer firmware revisions have addressed this issue, but it's still tricky sometimes) -First versions of NikonView were incredibly , to the point of the user not being able to recover transferred photos after a connection failure (that meant that aborted transfers at 90% of the card when you're using a slow serial protocol meant starting all over, quite fun). Don't worry, NikonView is now a lot more solid and, but I did suffer with the first versions. Overall, a very good camera that can give you very good photos (and that means printed photos). Also, keep in mind that the final price ends up rising, since you're likely to need at least the following accessories: A Bigger CompactFlash card (48 MB or 64 MB), At least 4 NiMh 1600 batteries + a charger, and a decent caseWith Zeiss lens instead of the Nikkor 7-21mm used and USB interface, this could still be the best 2.11 on the market.  Because of these details, and since I paid full retail $ when it came out, I'm keeping a star to myself...","Date":"April 6, 2001"}

We have two Blue and White Mac G3's and a Power  G3 powerbook.  If you have these USB dependent items, you need a USB  cardreader.  You also need AC adapter or battery recharger because the  batteries burn out very quickly.The other reviews have already panned  the manuals, so I'll just add that the documentation was a severe  letdown.This may work out, and the positive reviews posted elsewhere  have me optimistic.  It is a bit depressing to get the camera only to find  out you have at least a couple more purchases to make it useful. If you get  this camera, get the USB cardreader and rechargeable battery equipment at  the same time; you'll at least know how much the whole deal will cost you  and you'll avoid the disappointment of having an 80% usable unit on the day  of delivery.","Date":"December 12, 1999"}

I have Nikon 35mm cameras and like them. My Coolpix camera works fine and picture  quality is good, but, except for size, I think the Sony is superior in  almost every way.My biggest gripes about the Nikon are the cheesy,  print-it-yourself manual and absolutely maddening software that come with  it. The print-your-own instructions with the software are very confusing  and I don't believe I ever successfully printed the entire manual. I have  also never figured out how to download the camera itself (I can't get the  program to recognize the camera).  I ended up buying a Compact Flash reader  (if I were designing a camera, Compact Flash would be dead last on my list  of preferred memory cards.) and another software program which adds a  couple hundred dollars or more to the price of the camera. A decent sized  Compact Flash card will add another hundred or so (and then there are the  batteries and charger). If you take this camera on a vacation, you'll need  to bring your computer or several hundred dollars worth of memory  cards.For a camera in this price range, I think Nikon would be wise  include decent, already printed manuals and user-friendly software.","Date":"November 3, 1999"}

My first venture into  digital at 640 X 480 gave me a wish list of what it would take to satisfy  the quality requirements for serious photography.  A new, Hi resolution  printer paved the way for the arrival of the Coolpix 950 into my evolving  'desktop darkroom'. The quality / format range of basic 640 X 480 to XGA  Fine, to Uncompressed TIFF is magnificently supported by Nikon's superb  optics, accurate exposure options, adequate zoom range and very usable  macro.  From my Siamese Cat's eyes, to a handmade silver Hopi ring, to  mountain landscapes, all can be reproduced in astoundingly fine detail,  given a good quality printer.  The camera features may not be readily  apparent, but just carry around the Fast Track Guide for a couple of photo  sessions & it will give you the answers to all you want to know.  They laughed when I arrived with only a camera in it's belt-pack and 4  extra batteries - hardly enough size to be a professional quality camera -  compared to the kid with a full sized 35mm camera with huge flash and  massive zoom lens.  Later that evening, I was able to present  suitable  albums to both parents to show off with, while the kid with the 35mm was  still talking about availability of overnite photo-processing.  The 8 X  10's printed later were truly impressive.  On the down side, the  proprietary accessory flash connector eliminates use of a second source  light of my choosing - desirable in some instances, but not manditory.  As  in all high-drain applications, a pocket full of AA Alkalines will work.  Better than rechargeable NiCad's (even the high capacity ones) are the NiMH  batteries, which although expensive, far outlast any of the other  rechargeables. The 8 meg flash card is a good starter, but 32 - 80 meg  gives this little camera sufficient capacity for most photo situations.  If you need a camera solely for family snapshots & e-mail photos, you  won't begin to appreciate this camera's ability.  If you need to capture  Mai-Tai's brlliant blue eyes, the shy smile of a new bride at the altar, or  fine details of the jeweler's craft, then you will be able to exploit the  950's full potential.  Now, will I go out & sell the Olympus?  Doubtful, since they have the sentimental value of worldwide travel.  And  besides, they really do take wonderful slides...","Date":"October 20, 1999"}

Oh \"gadget fanatic\"","ReviewID":"R3HCHC7VH5S1QO","Overall":"good","Content":"Had this a little over a year, great camera--have the feeling I'm still only scratching the surface of what this thing is capable of. The Pros:1. Oustanding image quality, great colours, etc. Typically Nikon does err a little on the side of preserving detail, so you might find a little contrast/brightness adjustment in Photoshop to your taste. 2. Enough manual control if you want. Enough point and shoot in the Auto mode if you don't. 3. That swivel head gives great flexibility. 4. Best shot selection gives some really interesting flexibility with regard to avail. light photography (OK, so I know I really should use a tripod). The Not-so-good:1. The flash is disappointing. Terribly easy to red-eye anything biological :) Get the bracket and an add-on flash if you have to shoot flash. To be fair, tough for _any_ camera with the flash/lens this close together to not have the same problem (red eye reduc. or not).2. The pre-exposure focus lock does not 'feel' as definite (when you partially depress the exposure button) as on Nikon's 35mm SLRs. The nice, nice thing about the 990 is that the area of focus is artificially sharpened in the LCD viewfinder. _Very_ tough to check focus in 950 LCD viewfinder until _after_ you take the pic and magnify in the LCD. 3. Definitely less than great for fast moving action. Digitals in general are not the greatest for moving action. For long-time 35mm users, this is probably the hardest thing to get used to. By the time, you add in the focusing time, save to CF card, etc., there is a definite delay between pulling the trigger & getting the shot, as well as a significant delay between shots (flash use makes it worse). Some of this can be negated by swithing to Manual and presetting a focus distance, and so on, but it's an adjustment. Recommendations:1. Get three sets of NiMH rechargeable AA batteries--this thing eats batteries for breakfast.  2. Get a bigger CF memory card, at least 48MB.  3. Get a USB/PC card reader for the CF card--the serial connection is _painfully_ slow.  4. Download the .PDF file from Nikon's site which goes into a little more detail what the controls do.  5. Get this book! :)...  Would I get this again? YES, but I would probably spring the extra bucks for a Coolpix 990 for:1. Focus area sharpening 2. Selectable autofocus area 3. USB 4. QuickTime capture Less so for the 3.3 megapixel.","Date":"January 18, 2001"}

The close up shots (Macro Shots) are amazing.  I'm extremely satisfied with this camera.  If your a near power seller eBayer like myself, and you have the money, invest it into this camera.  It's really worth it.  I did my homework, and this camera gets you the best bang for your buck.  The CP800 and CP880 are good, but they are slightly worse than this model, and they require non-AA batteries, which are very expensive (so are the rechargeable ones and the charger).  The Coolpix 990 is slightly better than this model (it takes slightly better pictures and it boasts a higher resolution), but if you don't have the money, this model is worth it.  The Coolpix 950 and the Coolpix 990 are the best two digital camera's that you can buy for under [$].

I have taken some GREAT  shots and the results are AWESOME! I have no idea why anyone would complain  about this camera. It does everything I want to do, including taking  terrific detailed pictures of really small model cars. I have no comlaints  about this camera, and I would reccomend buying one!","Date":"February 23, 2000"}
{"Title":"best high-quality digital camera","Author":"\"aowhaus\"","ReviewID":"R23A1PFFALTD62","Overall":"good","Content":"This is a feature packed camera that takes near-professional quality images, probably the best of all digital cameras.  The manual mode allows you to adjust exposure, aperture, focus settings, etc. just like a SLR camera.  I especially like the swiveling lens that pivots a full 180 degrees -- it allows you to take photos easily at any angle.  It's great for taking pictures of yourself with friends without getting someone else to take it for you: just swing the lens around and hold out your arm and you could see yourself in the LCD screen.Some must-have accesories for this camera:1. Two sets of rechargable batteries and charger.  This camera uses a lot of juice.2. A wide angle lens.  Makes it easier to take photos of yourself.3. At least a 32meg flash card.  The 8meg card that comes with it doesn't hold a lot.Some negative points:1. It's pricey and the accessories are not cheap either.2. It takes a long time to download images to your computer directly from the camera.3. The flash is pretty useless, but then again the images look great without it at any light level.4. It's on the bulky side.Overall: This is a great camera for both work and play, I hope Nikon will make a more compact version of it with the swiveling lens.","Date":"December 8, 2000"}
{"Title":"Coolpix 950","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R4N53QVYQ0OG2","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had both the Coolpix 800 and the Coolpix 950. Ilike the 900 better but it has some of the same weaknesses. My peeves first;1. It powers up a full telephoto. I'd rather it stayed at wide angle. For Indoor shots, I'm constantly zooming out after power up to get a full width shot. This is a pain, especially given peeve #2.2. The flash performs well at wide angle but significantly underexposes when the lens is zoomed to telephoto. This is true regardless of distance. An object 15 feet away will be nicely exposed at wide angle but underexposed if you zoom to telephoto. Now my likes:1. Great image quality and good color fidelity2. The swivel head is increadibly useful. Hold the camera over your head when in a crowd and you can take great pictures without heads in the way. Hold it a waist level and you can handhold low light shots very easily. In both cases you can swivel the head so you can see the screen easily.3. Great low light performance. Tripod mounted it takes great star shots at 8 second shutter speed and can capture down to 6 magnitude stars.... just as good as the human eye.4. Magnesium body is better than plastic. Coolpix 990 went back to plastic.All in all, I'm very happy. Peeves are significant if you take indoor shots a lot.","Date":"April 26, 2001"}

I searched and searched for the perfect camera before I settled on the Coolpix 950.  I wanted at least 2.1 megapixels and could have gotten other brand 3.3 cameras for the list price of the 950, but the features of this camera are what sold me.  The additional lens and flash options make this a photographers dream.  The point and click options make my non-photographer wife very happy. The Good: 1. Picture quality excellent! 2. Exposure and composition excellent! 3. Very easy to use 4. Lots of picture (size) options 10 different picture formats for storage purposes 5. Battery Life not all that bad if you do not use the LCD screen as your viewfinder The Bad: 1. Nikon photo software is kinda crappy (I now use Adobe Photoshop) 2. The serial connection is really slow...I bought a (lexar 8x) 32 meg memory card and a usb card reader for $50 bucks 3. The 8 meg card is kinda small if you want high res shots 4. No lens cover (so I bought a UV filter lens cover) to protect the expensive Nikon lens $5. Overall, I am extemely please with this camera....the price was too good to pass-up...I used a $50 dollar off online coupon from Amazon which brought the price down to $706 and then Nikon had a $150 dollar rebate on the Coolpix 950.  I have not gotten that money yet, but when I do $556 for this camera is a steal.  Good luck buying your camera, and I hope this review was helpful.","Date":"January 10, 2001"}

With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care  because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to  just \"go for it.\" After blowing through several dozen test pics,  I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital  simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera.

The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically. The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create \"red eye\" a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.) I'd suggest getting at least 8 AA  batteries.I do suggest getting extra memory (I have 32 megs) and one of  those USB memory card readers, its a lot faster than a serial port.","Date":"May 12, 2000"}

You can set  Shutter speed or Aperture priority, spot metering, etc. Or you can set it  on automatic and treat it like a point and shoot camera. The resolution and  jpg compression options are quite versatile as well. I recommend adding a  64 meg Flash Card to the standard 8 Meg card for trips.

It is convenient, always works well outside, and the enlargements I have printed and framed have been outstanding.My only complaints are that it has a wimpy flash, comes with a very small compact flash card (8 MB), no decent editing software was included (Hotshots is very limited in what it can do), and the printed manual is inadequate for use in the field. Although full documentation is included on a CD, it isn't very helpful when taking pictures from a boat along the Naapali Coast of Kauai!I see that they have a $150 rebate until 12/31/00. It would make a great gift for ANY amateur photographer, and the Amazonprice with  rebate of $548 makes it a great bargain. I would not hesitate to get one KNOW. Make sure you get at least a 32MB card, and stock up on rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a charger.

My wife did well in point and shoot with only 15  seconds of training.  I solved the problem that the wide angle zoom  position is not wide enough by buying the wide angle attachment, the  telephoto position is not long enough by buying the teledoubler.  You also  need a 40 mb flash memory card to hold a lot of shots.  An A/C adapter with  a long cord for indoor power works well and a rechargeable battery pack for  out door shooting expeditions is manditory.  SanDisk makes a great  flashcard reader so you can import your pictures through the parallel port  at port speed, MS's Photodraw is sufficient for snap shooting processing  and Adobe PhotoShop for heavey duty photo publication.

I did quite a lot of research prior to the purchase and it paid off, this is a great camera.  The other reviews cover all the pros and cons quite well so I'll put a different spin with my problems.  No problems with the camera or performance, the camera does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Most folks problems seem to be mismatched expectations or not understanding the technology.  My issues, and I can't seem to find help anywhere, so if anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it:1. Learning the real differences between all the combinations of Size and Quality.  I purchased Corel Photo-Paint 9  Digital Camera Edition for not to much $$$ and like it a lot but the size, resolution, compression, quality, etc. choices just blow me away.  I have found a lot of people with digital cameras but who really don't understand this part of the technology and Nikon's manuals and reference guides do not really help the digital novice.  I learned my photography over 30 years ago before automatic cameras of any kind existed and I still struggle with understanding the digital formats. I have 2 books on order from Amazon that I hope will educate me.2. Nikon external flashes are too expensive.  Has anyone found a third-party flash that works well with this camera?All in all a wonderful camera and Amazon has the best prices and service.  E-mail me at info@mainelywood.com if you have questions or info I could use.  I added rechargeable batteries, the filters, a  card reader, and a 96 mb CompactFlash card from SanDisk (called Nikon, manual says only up to 64mb but Nikon has since tested Lexar and SanDisk of larger capacities and approves them).

We even did some exhibitions of our work. Digital consumer cameras like the Coolpix are still not up to their  originals. But you have also to note that doing all the work in the  darkroom is time consuming and difficult. Getting pictures from the lab is  either disappointing or very expensive and you lose control over the  process. Using the Collpix 950 and some Epson printer (eg. Stylus 900) is a  very good compromize. Be aware that the display is nearly of no use at sun  lite conditions and dealing with contrast is difficult as ever. But  otherwise it is fun using the Coolpix 950 and some pictures are really  good. Resolution is indead very good. For the not overly ambitious (but  still quality oriented) enthusiast this camera is a very good choice  although there will be some better one in 6 months.

I shoot many, many more  pictures now that I have a digital camera.If my old Fuji was a nifty PT  Boat, then my Nikon Coolpix 950 is an aircraft carrier.  The high 1600x1200  resolution mode is stunning to view on my PC.

There are a few annoyances about the camera: 1. The menu interface can sometimes be a bit odd, but once you figure out its logic, it works fine. 2. The 8 MB card that it comes with is too small if you plan to shoot in 1600x1200 resolutions. 3. If you mount the camera on a tripod, the card reader and battery compartment are not accessible, forcing you to take the camera off the mount to change cards or batteries. 4. The included manual is missing the last half of the text, although everything is in the PDF manual on the included CD.Those things aside, I really love this camera. It produces very good results and gives me the right amount of control when I need it. The wide-angle and telephoto lenses are great since they attach directly, without having to use a converter or step-down ring. If you want to shoot panorama images for QuickTime VR, this camera with the wide-angle lens works beautifully in conjunction with the Kaidan KIWI 900/950 tripod head. ... Long exposure shots are simple to do as well as other experimentation. It also has a B&W mode which actually produces very nice results, often overlooked in digital cameras. Nikon even makes a set of four filters specifically for the Coolpix cameras which are well worth it from a creative standpoint.The newer Coolpix 990 uses the same optics but with a larger CCD element. But if you are on a limited budget but you want a \"pro-sumer\" digital camera, you can get a 950 with a couple of lenses and an extra memory card ... fairly easily. If you just want the camera, plan on getting either a 32 or 64 MB card (Lexar or SanDisk) right from the start and keep the 8MB card handy in case you run out of space and need a few more shots.Almost a year after first searching for a digital camera, I would still buy either the 950 or 990 in a heartbeat.

Nikon's chief battery door designer was apparently sick that day, and the janitor obviously submitted the design they used.  Eventually, even if you're careful, the chintzy little lightweight plastic slots on the camera body that the battery door tabs lock into, will break, and your otherwise finely made and great performing camera will need a generous strip of ducttape to hold the door closed - this makes the necessity of using the highest capacity NiMH battery you can find all that more important.  I'm drawing up plans to fabricate some small metal tabs to embed into the camera body to replace the crappy broken plastic, but haven't yet gotten happy with the Dremel tool to do the work.Bottom line:  Be Careful when you open the battery door - press it down against the camera body before you slide it to the unlocked or open position, and you can delay the inevitable plastic tab failure that will ruin an otherwise outstanding camera.","Date":"September 25, 2005"}

{"Title":"Great Digital Camera with many feature","Author":"Aditya Sjartuni","ReviewID":"R1MGWTI5FLKAZH","Overall":"good","Content":"This is great camera with many features. You can take the pictures in many conditions. The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting. You can use the A-REC mode for automatic shooting & M-REC mode for manual Shooting. You will have a great photos just using A-REC mode. Just switch on the bottom & ready to take photos. If you want more professional photos use M-REC mode. You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture. In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light. The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web, sending though E-mail & print in A4 paper. The worst think that I know is a battery live. This camera it's so hungry with power, that I thought same with the others digicam. For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries, which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used. You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object.","Date":"December 24, 2000"}

I previously owned a Nikon SLR and had no doubt this was going to be a quality product.  The 880 was too small for my husband's big hands and the 990 was little more camera than we needed.Unfortunately after two months of use, all the photos taken in automatic mode were underexposed.  I called Nikon tech support and they walked me through a couple of things to try but nothing worked.  I found the tech support people to be undertrained and I knew more about the camera than some of them (pretty bad considering you drill down to the specific \"Coolpix 950 support\" through the automated phone menu).  One support person blamed the 64MB Viking compact flash card on my problems, saying they only support Lexar (brand that comes with the camera) or SanDisk, and that Viking \"is known to cause problems\" with the Coolpix 950!  I have read many reviews and never heard of this problem!  I called Viking and they had no knowledge of any incompatability with the 950.  Eventually Nikon replaced the strobe light under warranty but it's still got the same underexposure problem.  To their credit, Nikon paid for my camera to be returned to them for a second time.  I am waiting to receive my camera back.I still like Nikon unfortunately all the hospital pictures when I gave birth to my son are now sitting on my hard drive and every photo is underexposed.","Date":"March 2, 2001"}

It's quite easy to use, and perfect for the beginner.  The only real gripes I have are the limitations in the size of the Compact Flash it uses, and the fact that after a time, the battery compartment won't stay closed.  Otherwise, I've taken some fantastic pictures with this camera!  In fact, I'd have to say it does better than some of the newer Nikon Coolpix cameras (like the L18, which I also have).  I've found newer models to have focus and flash issues, as well as severe shutter lag.  This may not be comparable in resolution, but it's quite enough for most uses.  You don't need more than 2.1 MegaPixel for decent resolution unless you're doing huge blow-ups of photographs.","Date":"December 21, 2008"}
{"Title":"Easy to use and highly addictive","Author":"Dusty White \"Advanced Tarot Secrets author an...","ReviewID":"R1YW66RUDM7XLP","Overall":"good","Content":"I love my Nikon. It was a gift from a friend who is a professional photographer. She had outgrown it and was tired of me complaining that I saw this or that and wished at the time I had a better camera than my phone.If you have never used one of these before it will take a little getting used to. The camera pivots in half (which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens. The whole thing rotates freely 360 degrees, with snap-lock settings at each 180, so you can watch yourself \"taking a picture of you\" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder. The flash is a bit annoying, as it automatically fires in even remotely low-light circumstances. A simple press of a button disables the flash, but then you have a longer exposure time (about one full second) which means that you have to keep your hands really, really still. Just for fun, try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes.This camera is really at its best during the day. It should win an award for being the official picnic (or even beach) camera. It really is point and shoot, but it has an easy to learn and use zoom, auto/manual flash, and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery. The live motion feed on the viewing screen is a bit jittery, but for the price that is nothing to sneeze at. My guesstimate is something like 3-5 frames-per-second of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture.The short version: It is self-contained, easy to load and swap the memory card. It takes high resolution photos, and is so easy to use (and durable) that a 5 year-old could handle it (carefully). Stock up on extra AA batteries though. It eats through 4 of them in a few days of use.Hope this helps","Date":"September 14, 2008"}

I currently sell items on eBay, and I've been using a HP C200 Digital Camera for the past year to take pictures of items that I was selling.  It got the job done, but when it came to detailed shots and close ups, it just didn't cut it.  I just received my Nikon Coolpix 950 and it's amazing.  Excellent detail at 1600x1200 resolution.  The close up shots (Macro Shots) are amazing.  I'm extremely satisfied with this camera.  If your a near power seller eBayer like myself, and you have the money, invest it into this camera.  It's really worth it.  I did my homework, and this camera gets you the best bang for your buck.  The CP800 and CP880 are good, but they are slightly worse than this model, and they require non-AA batteries, which are very expensive (so are the rechargeable ones and the charger).  The Coolpix 990 is slightly better than this model (it takes slightly better pictures and it boasts a higher resolution), but if you don't have the money, this model is worth it.  The Coolpix 950 and the Coolpix 990 are the best two digital camera's that you can buy for under $1000.00.  If you want to go up another level, you need to be ready to shovel out over $3000.00 for camera's like the Nikon D1.  For accessories, get a USB CompactFlash Card reader, an A/C Adaptor, and two sets of rechargeable batteries.  I recommend a tripod as well, a small one especially for Macro shots.  Overall, this is a very good camera.  The Coolpix 990 has better resolution, better picture quality, and its design is better, but if you don't have the extra money, the Coolpix 950 is simply the best you can get.","Date":"January 12, 2001"}

I started out with a 4x5 Speed Graphic and latched onto a 35mm SLR almost as soon as Pentax made them available, so I can speak from hands-on experience.This camera--the 950 Coolpix model is a royal pain in the ash! Not only did they jam so many features into this little digital wonder, including video, but the controls used to select all of them are downright confusing and VERY not intuitive. The optical 3x zoom is nothing special, the standard lens is not wide-angle enough and the resulting photos are no better than some of its cheaper rivals. My suggestion? Purchase the CP800 if you can, its not jammed with as many high-megapixels, but its convenience, fast operability and consistent results play a huge role! Convenience in taking pictures is paramount for me and when the light is low and the controls become difficult, NO THANKS!

I purchased a digital camera in 1997 and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then.  However, 3 years later, I stumbled upon the Nikon  Coolpix 800 at a great price and took another shot at digital  imaging.PICTURES: The pictures it takes are fantastic!  The 1600x1200  resolution really makes a difference when making prints.  They look like  they were taken with a 35mm.  This is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality Nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not.  Another feature that impressed me was the fact I could  add additional lenses to it (and Nikon has 3 designed specifically for the  Coolpix 800/950/990).FEATURES: It has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed TIFF format, ability to take B&W pictures,  and adjustable metering.  However, for a non-professional photographer, I  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away.  I now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture, but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box.  Unlike other reviewers, mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a CD-ROM that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic ones.This is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn't want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used.  Otherwise, the CP990 and the  D1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control.  I do  recommend getting an extra Flash card since 8 MB does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in FINE or NORMAL mode.  Getting a USB SanDisk  CompactFlash reader was also a big help since the built-in connection is  serial and can take a LONG time to download pictures if you have a lot of  them.","Date":"April 15, 2000"}

I was looking for a camera that was above 2 mega pixels and $500 or below.  I have read some of the reviews about the low quality of pictures in a dark room, but after playing with the light meter adjustment I did not have any problems with the quality of brightness of the photo.  I even went to the extreme and took some close up photos, outside, in total darkness of a Hybiscus bush.  The photo showed incredible detail and deep rich color from the flowers. I also read some of the complaints about the auto focus always being on and drawing on battery power.  This is only the case if you leave it on this setting.  You can set it to only auto focus when you press the shutter half way.The pros for this camera are: It's easy to figure out.  Takes great pictures. Has lots of features for manual and automatic photos.  You can even take black and white photos. Different lens settings like fisheye and wide angle. Manual and Auto settings.  LCD screen is incredible.  It does have a lens cover. and it is fairly compact.  It's a lot of fun shooting pictures just to see what kind of results you get with the manual settings.  I was able to have fun with this camera right out of the box.  My only complaints are that I wish it came with a power supply, the battery cover is a little flimsy, and the software that comes with the camera isn't anything to get all excited over.

There are a few minor issues that I wish I had known when I was shopping for digital cameras.  I would like to have a little more zoom capability than the 2x lens provides, as well as better macro capability (or any macro at all).  I understand  that the Coolpix 950 has both.  A flashcard disk drive is a neccessity as  battery life is very short (4 AABatteries last maybe an hour). For example,  taking and uploading 14 photos will zap 4 brand new Duracell Ultras.  I did  purchase 4 Nickel Metal rechargeable AA's and that helps ease the pain of  replacing batteries.  It would be nice if they included the AC  adapter, no question this is a must for this camera.  Uploading pictures  from the camera to PC is easy but slow with the provided software.  An  additional photo editor other that the one provided will be neccessary to  do any creative editing.On the bright side, the camera has an  outstanding compact flash and is loaded with nice features that I have not  taken the time to figure out.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this  camera as the quality of photos can help me overlook some of it's  shortcomings.

I am using  CamediaMaster from Olympus and I am very happy, it is not the best for retouching, but it the best to managing  and organizing your pictures, besides you can play a slide show without need of create any album, just play the file.

{"Title":"Superb Images","Author":"Larry Vevig","ReviewID":"R3D0QI1V9XXRDL","Overall":"good","Content":"The images that this camera is capable of producing will be hard to duplicate in any other digital camera that can be purchased for under $600.  Previous reviews have mentioned size, controls, and rudimentary software  as problems.  I don't believe Nikon or anyone else bills this camera as  a 'pocket' camera.  If size is a big criteria, consider the Canon S10. The  CP800 is easy to hold and is not so small that it is hard for someone with  larger hands to manipulate.I find the controls about average for a  digital camera.  Digital cameras don't work like film cameras and require  that you develope new skills.  No matter what camera you purchase there  will always be a learning curve involved.  Most of the controls seem quite  logical and once you are used to them, cease to be a problem.The Nikon  View software is simply a means of getting the images from the camera to  the computer.  From there you can use the image editing program of your  choice to modify or print your pictures.  One of the great things about a  digital camera is the fact that you CAN adjust and retouch your photos.  Many cameras download their pictures via a serial cable and they are all  slow.  USB card readers are inexpensive (around $50) and GREATLY speed up  the process.One big plus is the availability of additional lenses and  filters, another feature not generally found in cameras of this price  range.No one camera is a good 'fit' for every user but if what you are  looking for is great film-quality images, you won't be dissapointed with  the CP800.","Date":"January 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera, minor annoyances","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RCEJ2X48HEXMJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had my CoolPix 800 since November and for the most part, I am very pleased with it.  The pictures are great and there are a fair amount of features that the advanced amateur will find useful.  Two major  disappointments however are the inability to control the shutter speed and  aperature, and the battery life.  Nikon's web site will lead you to believe  that you can control the shutter speed and aperature (such as when you are  taking fast action shots or photos at night), but this is not true.  Shutter speed and aperature are automatically controlled no matter what you  are shooting.  To get that kind of control, you need to be purchasing the  CoolPix 950.  Amazon's review that \"battery life is a winner\" is  a crock.  The camera eats battries at an alarming rate even with the LCD  screen switched off.  I have considered purchasing a rechargeable set, but  my solution is to buy the battries in bulk at Costco.  You can get a brick  of 48 AA Kirkland battries for about $12.  These battries are almost as  highly rated (according to Consumer Reports) as regular Duracell's and a  whole lot less expensive.  Unfortunately, not using rechargeables is not  the most environmentally friendly option.  By the way, the owners manual on  CD.  Get a clue Nikon, that one's a real pain!","Date":"January 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"I love my Nikon 800 Digital Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RK27RGDNTJ1UQ","Overall":"good","Content":"I've been a camera nut for over 30 years, but have always used 35mm or 2-1/4 film.  I have had my Nikon 800 for 6 weeks now and doubt I will ever use film again.  The photo quality is fantastic.  Using the normal setting, about 500kb/photo(the high res is about twice the size), the 4x6 prints are indistinguishable from 35mm and are comparable at 8x10.  The ability to image both the light and dark portions (ie the shaddowed areas in a bright sunshine shot) of a photo are far superior to film.  My prints on an HP 862 printer using \"best print quality\" and Kodak glossy premium picture paper are photo shop quality.It is very easy to use. I have spent less than 5 minutes with the manual.  I have shot almost everything on auto exposure with great results. I have had no problem with exposures too dark.Three small negatives (pun intended),  the cycle time between exposures can exceed 2 seconds, the flash is weak, and the Pictureworks/HotShots software included is cumbersome.  The exposure speed, iso 100 equivilent, can be frustrating in low light situations, but this is common to all digital cameras.  You do need to buy a 36 or 64mb... flash card to hold 60 to 120 photos until you can download to yourcomputer.  The 8mb that comes with this (and most other) camera only holds 8 to 16 images.  A SanDisk USB flash card reader...  will quicken the transfer to your computer and save batteries.","Date":"December 9, 2000"}
{"Title":"Fantastic quality for hundreds less than the 3 megpix models","Author":"Christopher Campbell \"campbellcj\"","ReviewID":"R721PGF2EYF7X","Overall":"good","Content":"I came very close to purchasing the CoolPix 990 or Olympus C3030Z for twice the price of the CP800, but after a few days with this little gem I am very pleased with my choice. The extra money is well spent on accessory  lenses, rechargable NiMH batteries, memory cards and reader. The 2X  optical zoom is not a big issue if you add on a telephoto lens -- the  current Nikons all support add on lenses with their threaded barrel, using  the properly sized adapter rings.  Keep in mind that the digital zoom on  the 800, and most digital cameras, results in severe noise and distortion.  I doubt I'll ever use the digital zoom.Image quality is superb, and I  have found myself marvelling at the sharpness of pics shot at full res  (1600x1200) in fine mode, even at fully automatic settings.  Color and  white balance seem very natural, and of course are user-settable in manual  mode. Nikon's expertise in quality optics and metering is very evident  here.Minor concerns are that the battery cover area seems flimsy, and  also the optical viewfinder must be used with the right-eye to avoid severe  nose-smudging of the large LCD, which is flush with the rear case and dead  center so right in nose territory!User interface is quite friendly and  easily mastered with a bit of experimentation on the menus.You WILL want  a USB or PC-card CompactFlash reader as the camera does not include USB  support natively. Serial port transfers are a joke with files this big  (600-900K per pic)!I highly recommend this camera to intermediate  photographers who want more resolution, manual control, and lens options  than a low-end device, but do not need all the bells and whistles of the  $800+ 3-megapixel \"big guns\".","Date":"June 1, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent camera for an excellent price","Author":"Richard Maher","ReviewID":"R2LDZP39RLSRN7","Overall":"good","Content":"If your thinking about buying a digital camera for this price definitely buy this Nikon 800. The 2.1 megpixels far outshine any 1.3 mega pixels cameras. The LCD monitor is like a tv. The battery life is also excellent I  get about 1.5 hours on my rechargeables. Its completely worth the extra few  bucks, why settle for less, as they say.I love this camera ive played  with some similarly priced ones(EG Canon powershot s100) but i still love  the Nikon 800. But so as to help you I'll tell you some points to note  about the camera that some people may not like.1. Rechargeable batteries  are a must,eventhough the battery life is one of the longest around its  pretty much a necessity for any digital camera. Batteries + recharger cost  me 17 dollars.2. The zooming capabilities on digital cameras are not  very good. However for the Nikon you can buy a telefoto lens. 3. The  memory card supplied with digital cameras is always the most basic. The  Nikon comes with an 8MB card which with the settings(picture quality,  picture size) that I have selected gets me about 50 pics. However at the  best pic qualtiy and largest photo size, this card can only store one  photo. However my photos show no adverse degradation in quality or size, so  I do not feel the need to buy more memory.4. There are loads of manual  functions that you may never use, or use only sometimes. But it means that  everybody is happy.  5. It's takes alot of practice(a few days) to  capture moving objects and ensure to get the object at the precise moment  you want it.  6. It comes with a soft, flimsy case , you want to buy  more protection. 7. Downloading photos using the serial port is ok for  an 8MB card. Anything higher than 16MB may become annoying. Certainly if  your impatient get the usb card reader...I would  be willing to pay a 100 bucks more for this camera its seriously that good.  The pictures produced are just of such good quality.Suffice to say Im very  happy with my purchase.","Date":"August 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"A Pretty Good Camera For Your Money","Author":"Christopher Sheppard","ReviewID":"RF8S5VSKCK7B2","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera having never used digital, and I must say I was stunned! It is VERY easily used, and even if you're not electronically inclined, you'll figure it out in about 15 with the help of the QuickStart  guide that comes with it. I will say that for a more advanced  user/experienced photographer, it may seem a little elementary; you can't  change shutter speed (this is automatic), F-stop has very limited  variability, zoom is so-so (though there are a variety of accessory lenses  you can purchase).As for batteries, do yourself a favor and buy some  NiMH rechargeable batteries (takes 4 AA) at radio shack, where a set of  four plus the charger is only 19.99. This Camera is a ravenous,  battery-devouring beast, and you will have to change batteries after 45  mins if you use alkaline. With the NiMH, I have yet to kill them- they last  forever.The auto mode is very user friendly, and does just about  everything for you. The manual mose allows you to change around things a  bit (but does limit you, for example the shutter I mentioned)There are  several different resolutions you can use (the default is 1600x1200, but  you can shoot 640x480 or smaller), and also several shooting options like  16-shot which takes 16 shots over the course of about 5-8 secs, bestshot  which will take 10 and the camera decides which is the best. Or you can  take up to 40 frames per second.You might want to get an extra or larger  memory card because even though they say it holds 200 pictures, this is a  bit stretched. It will hold about 30 basic quality, 16 normal quality, 8  fine quality or 1 high quality in the 1600x1200 mode, and about 200, 100,  50, 5 in the 640x480 mode. Though I WILL say that the 640x480 VGA mode is a  good mode because even a 19\" monitor cannot display a 1600x1200 shot,  and part of it will always be off screen, whereas the 640x480 almost  perfectly fits the screen (I use the 640x480 VGA mode myself). Plus the  1600x1200 shoty takes quite a qhile to upload.Summing it up, if you have  never used a digital before, you will be surprised off you A-- at how easy  it is to use and take good photos. If you are a professional or have  experience, you might want to go with the 900, 950, or 990.I give it 4.5  stars","Date":"June 28, 2000"}
{"Title":"Best deal out there","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3PX2CNMIN8M19","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the 3rd digital camera I've purchased.  My first model was a 640x480, which looked good in emails, but was really lacking when I tried to print my pictures out.  Next came a megapixel model, which was better,  because it made prints look good, but I couldn't zoom or crop much before  my pictures started looking fuzzy.  It was time for a 2 megapixel model.  I  looked at the Coolpix 950, but it was too big and too expensive.  I looked  at the Canon digital elph too.  It's small and cute, but in my opinion  isn't worth the extra money. I looked at a few other models too,  but I kept coming back to the Nikon.  I think that most people agree that  Nikon optics are about the best available, and they have a good track  record with previous models of film and digital cameras...Good stuff: GREAT pictures; Nikon lens; optical (not digital)  zoom (though not quite as powerful as some); Compact Flash (personal  preference, maybe, but available in bigger capacities); Much more compact  than the 950, with most of the features and the same resolution.Not as  good: have almost lost the lens cap several times already; batteries don't  last too long with lcd on; get rechargeables! Unless you're a hardcore  photographer, this should have all of the manual abilities and photo  quality you need.  If you are a hardcore photographer, you probably want  one of the 3 megapixel models instead...For me, the Coolpix 800 is 80%  of a new Olympus 3030 or a Coolpix 990, but for less than half the price.

Be warned though that you should prepare to spend quite a  bit more than the cost of the camera. 2 sets of batteries and a recharger  are a neccessity and maybe an AC adapter as well. Nikon should try to  include a recharger, nothing kills the digital camera experience more than  realizing that your camera lasts for about 30 minutes before you need to  put in new batteries. Also the 8 MB card is useless. You can only take 1  (!) high quality uncompressed image. Factor in...for a 64 MB  Compact Flash. Likewise I havent found any image editing software (also a  negative with Nikon is you get no printed manual and the basic software is  VERY basic) so you will need to purchase some editing software.","Date":"August 11, 2000"}

The automatic picture taking mode does a good job of metering and focusing while the manaul mode gives the user the ability to change ISO, exposure, white balance and focus.  I have had the camera in the dark, wet depths of slot canyons in Utah to the high, snowy country of Colorado.  It has performed well in a variety of temperatures and has held up to a number of good hard knocks.  An optional 28mm wide angle lens attachment is great.  The only items that detract from the allure of this camera are: The flash is a bit weak.  The serial port connection is slow, get a USB card reader.  NiMH batteries are a must (But that holds true for just about any digital camera product).  The included 8MB card is not hardly enough.  Buy at least a 32MB card.

The optional lenses  block most of the view finder when they're in use. As the representative  told me, you must use the LCD monitor when using the optional telephoto  lens (and apparently other lenses and digital cameras). Unfortunately, the  LCD monitor is virtually useless in dim lighting or bright sun. So this is  a very serious design error. I can recommend this camera only if you never  intend to use the optional lens.","Date":"September 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Only the pictures are good","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3W260XMFNAVDX","Overall":"good","Content":"I have virtually no digital camera experience and bought this camera about a week ago.  I did extensive on-line research and the reviews were outstanding concerning picture quality.  In this regard the reviews were  accurate. However, I mistakenly thought that picture quality was the only  necessary feature in a digital camera.  Wrong.  I have found many  disaapointing features in this camera.  First, that the camera's manual is  on disk rather than paper is LAME!  How are you supposed to read how to  download and process pictures when your computer screen is tied up reading  the manual. Second, the camera's controls are very confusing.  Many buttons  serve dual (sometimes three) functins which of course you have to memorize  because the manual is only on disk.  (There is a printed pocket guide but  it is an abbreviated version.) By the way, I printed the entire manual and  it is still the worst written electronic manual I have ever read. More  experienced digital photographers may not mind this. Third, the camera has  a cheap feel to it.  After buying it I went to a few stores to see some  others and realized how cheap the feel of this camera was.  Fourth, the  camera is an odd shape and size making it difficult to put it in your  pocket and go.  Fifth, the serial cable provided is a slow method of  transfer.  Purchase of a card reader is a must.  Sixth,  the Nikon View  software is very basic.  Thus, a photo editing program will be necessary.  Finally, the lens cap is not tethered to the camera.  While this is not a  big deal, it is inconvienant, but more importantly highlights the many  shortcomings of the camera's design.  Again, although I have many  complaints I have to admit the picture quality is exceptional.  The  question is would I buy this camera again.  Probably not.  I would trade a  slight reduction in picture quality for a better thought out camera which  is easier to use.  By the way, I have since discovered that the place I  bought it has a 30% restocking charge precluding return of the camera.  I  strongly suggest that anyone contemplating the purchase of a digetla camera  on-line go to a local store first just to handle a few diffrent models and  then check the rules regarding on-line returns.","Date":"December 27, 1999"}

The biggest is that the zoom is  disappointing compared to other mega pixel cameras -- even with the  optional teleconverter lens.

As others have said before, there are a few kinks you will have to live with, if you go for Nikon's entry level: 1) flimsy covers for battery/smartcard/lens 2) this thing eats up batteries, get lots of NiMH rechargables. (the batteries that came with the camera were empty after shooting 15 pictures and downloading them to PC) When you turn the camera on, the LCD monitor turns on and the camera is in constant metering/focusing mode. So, running around like that for a while, eats up batteries even more. If you don't want to use the monitor, you have to turn it off when you switch the camera on.Summary: great pictures for a decent price, if you can live with the above.","Date":"October 21, 2000"}

{"Title":"Bang For Your Buck!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3QKCDY9ATQA5M","Overall":"good","Content":"Wow!  What a bargain!  At a price less than most of the competition (cameras w/ at least 2 megapixels), the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a steal.  This camera has many advanced features, many found on higher-end cameras, although it's still simple enough for novice users, like me, to handle.  With a quick skim the manual you will be off and running.  The layout of the camera is very logical and easy to navigate.  Most people will probably use the autofocus although a manual focus mode is avaliable for more \"advanced\" options for photo-taking.  The autofocus is terrific and allows the user to have a \"point-and-click\" attitude to digital photo imaging while encompassing the advantages of the incoming \"digital age.\"  The TFT LCD screen allows you to have a great view of pictures you have taken and stored on the compact flash card.  The LCD on-screen menu is extremely easy to operate.  It produces superb pictures rivaling many higher resolution cameras.  With a decent printer, you could produce photos detailed enough to rival that of regular 35mm \"professional\" development. The print quality is great and it is enhanced by high quality photo paper.  It is a good idea to do plenty of research on the digital camera topic before you purchase one since it is quite an investment even for the \"cheaper\" cameras.  The included 8mb compact flash card is decent, holding 16 \"normal\" detail 1600X1200 photos, although I would recomend purchasing a larger capacity one (i.e. 16mb+).  Another additional bonus would be to purchase a compact flash reader to download the images.  They are relatively cheap and reduce the download time.  Rechargeable batteries would be an added plus since the LCD display is a battery drainer.  Another important accessory would be a high-quality carring case considering the amount of money put into the camera.  Overall the Nikon Coolpix 800 is a great camera at a bargain price.","Date":"January 6, 2001"}

Sharp pictures, excellent focusing & light weight.Here are some negative points if that's what you are looking for -1. It is a battery hogger. The 4 energizer (alkaline) battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about 20 pictures. You NEED rechargeable NiMH battery. .... Andthe charger is [even more money]. You don't really need the optional AC adapter. It is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the PC.2. The 8MB CompactFlash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the 1600x1200 resolution which is the default. At normal compression, you can have only 16 pictures. I feel that 640x480 resolution should have been the default. 640x480 is only available in advanced options. At 640x480, the 8MB card can hold 102 pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me. But if you want to stick to 1600x1200, you may be better off considering a card with more capacity.I decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable (as in the case of battery usage) or not applicable to all (as in the case of resolution & storage size).I had been using Nikon N50 (non-digital) for years and had fallen love with that camera.

They all  graduated college before I did.  They all got married before I did.  They  all had kids before I did.  And they all bought digital cameras before I  did.  Being the last digital camera purchaser had its advantages, though.  I got to learn from all of their mistakes!  I have a friend with the  Olympus 460, one with a Nikon Coolpix 950 (the fancier version of the 800),  and one with a Kodak 280.  They all bring their cameras along on hikes and  camping trips, so I was able to see all of the pros and cons to help me  make my own purchase.  I decided that I wanted 2 mega-pixels and optical  zoom.  I also didn't want to spend more than $500.  I ruled out the Olympus  right away, because it only has a 1.2 mega-pixel image size and I want at  least 2 mega-pixels so I can make 5x7s or even 8x10s.  Of course, after I  bought my Coolpix 800, I learned that Olympus is coming out with a 2  mega-pixel version of the 460, so if I were buying it today, I'd have to  reconsider. After ruling out the Olympus, I was left with the Kodak DC280  and the Coolpix.  My friend's 950 was outside of my budget, but that's OK,  because I didn't like the shape of the 950 (weird twisty thing) or its  size.  The 800 is smaller and looks and feels like a normal camera.  If you  compare the 800 to the Kodak DC280, they basically look identical.  2x  optical zoom, 3x digital zoom, Compact Flash card, AA batteries, optical  viewfinder, LCD display, etc...they're nearly identical.  In the end, I  figured \"Kodak mostly makes instamatics, and Nikon makes lots of  high-quality 35mm cameras\".  I've heard lots of great things about  Nikon film cameras, and figured that this technology would carry over to  their digital cameras.  Besides, with the rebate, the Nikon is  cheaper!I'm totally thrilled with my decision.  The pictures are  fantastic, and the camera never fails to amaze me with its flexibility.  Though it's not as fancy as the 950, it's LOTS cheaper and is easier to  carry.  Look around: if you want a 2 mega-pixel camera with an optical  zoom, you can count on spending $500 or $550.  This camera has all the  features I need with an awesome price!  Definitely happy with my purchase,  and happy with the quick painless service I received from Amazon.  I can  recommend this camera without reservations.  You won't outgrow it any time  soon, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon lens.","Date":"August 8, 2000"}

The only things I wish this camera had are a stronger zoom lens and a stronger flash for indoors. I'm very happy with this camera and feel I got a good deal for my first digital camera.","Date":"November 1, 2000"}

I don't understandwhat the other comments are complaining about.  Mine came with aninstruction booklet, a foldout \"getting started\" sheet (which was very well written), and a CD for more detailed instruction. But, all I needed was the starter sheet, 15 minutes of trying it out, and found it was intuitively simple.  I also didn't have trouble with battery life (I used the alkalines that came with it).  I took 20 pictures, downloaded them into my computer and STILL had PLENTY of battery life.  This is a nice compact camera with some great features...This is an amazing camera at an amazing price - and I am usually very finicky.  I'd recommend this camera whole-heartedly.","Date":"June 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"Good camera, but go for the Nikon Coolpix 880","Author":"ira_nyc","ReviewID":"R1V0CYCM3LW8JN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Skip this digital camera and go directly to the Coolpix 880 by Nikon (also on Amazon). Why, you ask? Well, this Coolpix is quite old (in terms of digital) and you'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera. Here are the details why:Megapixels. The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures, but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel.  (More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality. ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference!)Zoom. The 800 has a 2x optical, plus 2.5 digital zoom lens; however, the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom.  You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy!Memory. Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash, but most people would agree that this isn't enough.  Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you'll be happy you did.Downloading. The 800 only connects via serial port, but the 880 connects via serial OR USB. THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer, but the serial (800's only method) is horrendously slow.Batteries.  THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries, but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries. The 880's batteries also weigh less.Price. This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ($499) over the 880 ($699).  But let's face it, if you have $499 for the 800, you should fork over the extra $200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year. The 800 is being phased out by Nikon. RUN to the 880 today! :)","Date":"April 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great picture quality!","Author":"David J. Grant","ReviewID":"R3L2NQIHPIFJ3W","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for just over 1 year.  Picture quality out of the camera is phenomenal.  With a high quality printer I get better pictures than I ever did with my 35mm.  I would suggest a minimum of 32 MB compact flash card, but they're cheap now.The serial connection is the biggest problem with this camera.  It can take an hour or more to download 32 MB of pictures and you have to use the Nikon software which doesn't always like W2k.  But a card reader is relatively cheap and does the job quickly without draining the batteries.The optical zoom went out after about 5 months and Nikon quickly repaired it.  I've heard this is not an uncommon problem though.  It's worked great since then though.  We always use the LCD screen and haven't run into a problem with guzzling battery power since we started using the card reader, even with normal batteries.Although I haven't seen better pictures from any other camera in the 2 MP range, the red-eye flash on this one doesn't seem to do much good, and most of the photos with people in them need to be edited if a flash was used.  The menu on the camera does allow you a lot of options and control when taking pictures though.  In fact the camera has two modes - one where more control is permitted and one where most of it is automatic.  Nice if you know what you're doing.All in all it takes great pictures, but doesn't have many bells & whistles for the price and you'll need to buy a USB card reader.","Date":"November 26, 2001"}

The lens mechanism is quite flimsy and costs more than the camera (!!) to fix2) Buy a Compact Flash reader - don't even think about downloading photos any other way - its just not worth itThe comments that other reviewers have made about the lack of paper manual, flimsy battery door, and battery consumption are correct ... but the first twio you eventually get used to - and the last seems to be true of most digital cameras.Buy it as a starter camera ... be REALLY careful with it ... and you'll get some pretty good photos!","Date":"July 22, 2001"}
{"Title":"Big things do come in SMALL packages","Author":"John Ingle","ReviewID":"RF1FDMFJNVKHX","Overall":"good","Content":"This is one great tiny camera!  I was kinda shocked by how small it was when I first opened it but it's compact size betrays the many features hidden within it's frame.  However, this may be a downfall to someone with  big hands so if you do you may want to find one at a camera or electronics  store before you buy. There was one thing that I did find annoying and  that was the online manual.  The manual is pretty informative but if you  are like me and are outdoors a bit...well the online manual won't do you  anygood, so read up before you try and leave home with it.Other than  those two very minor features this camera more than does the job.  It is  very lightweight and compact yet it has the ability to add various other  lenses from fisheye, macro, and a telephoto.  The flash is powerful enough  to handle most any shot and you have the option to change the film speeds  to compensate even further.  It shoots in standard form at 1600x1200 but  can be reduced to 640x480.  If you want to take high speed pictures, you  have the option from single, continuous, up to an amazing 40 continuous  shots.  This is my first digital camera so I don't know if others have  these features but for the price and the size I can almost bet you are not  going to find one that rivals this little Nikon in quality.  I would highly  recommend this camera to anyone.","Date":"May 8, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great camera and GREAT tech support","Author":"Eileen Galen","ReviewID":"RU8DDQ10JEOEF","Overall":"good","Content":"I wanted a digital camera for all the usual reasons. In addition to its usefulness for emailing, my second reason is that I take hundreds of snapshots yearly that I throw out as soon as I get home - sometimes, while still at Kinko's.  It seemed like such a great idea to be able to delete all my duds - before any tree ever has to die for them, or (gasp) any photo lab worker has to see them. This is a great little camera. It is truly a simple-to-use, lightweight thing. I agree with all the praise.  I wish I had known at the outset (if only to spare myself the headache) that the instruction manual - the good, big, complete one that I wanted to read cover-to-cover - is on a CD rom.  Don't plan on reading it in bed, unless you want to first print all 54 pages. The little \"quick\" booklet (missing much material)  that comes in the package has a loosely organized table of contents to the CD, but, inexplicably, no page numbers that would correspond to the topics in the printed material, so you must search. You must buy separate photo-editing software, unless you want to send your nice little photos only to have your recipient download them in in that ridiculous huge size we've all seen.  In addition you will not be able to modify your photos in any way without the software.Four double A batteries were used up in an hour of snapping, viewing, deleting, snapping. When the batteries begin to wear out, the camera gets sluggish, and then it's time. A  rechargeable battery pack (or two) is a must.An excellent feature of any Nikon camera is that the Nikon tech support line is a twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week operation. This is incredible.  I had a few glitches with the Nikon software, and phoned several times. I was helped right away - efficiently and well. That alone is a fantastic plus, especially for someone who is not particularly good with new gadgetry. Terrific.","Date":"February 21, 2001"}
{"Title":"My first digital camera","Author":"Malinda Wilson","ReviewID":"R3QV2L7F9G8NFD","Overall":"good","Content":"I received my Nikon Coolpix800 in the mail on Friday, almost in time to get all the nights of Chanukah.  I took it to the dinner that evening and took pictures of the kids and other congregants.  I also took it home and took some great close-up shots.  You can't necessarily tell how the picture will come out just from looking at the LCD screen, but when the pictures were viewed on my computer, they were really nice.  The pictures were clear.  Even though the room wasn't that light, the pictures were fairly bright.  I forgot to change the focus to distance for one picture of the kids on the stage, so it didn't come out that great--oops.  Also, the close-up shots were really nice--even in darkness or low light, when the LCD screen won't show anything, the pictures come out clear and bright.  I noticed two things I thought were unusual.  The first is that the pictures seem to be better when the zoom lens is low or zoomed-out.  If I used the close zoom as opposed to simply moving closer, the picture seemed darker and less clear.  The second--the batteries did start to go low later in the evening.  So, I plugged in the A/C adapter.  I forgot to unplug it, and the batteries were fully-charged in the AM.  I don't think I was sent rechargeable batteries, but having the A/C adapter seems to extend the battery life, so, though I saw the low battery light in the evening on the first night I started taking pictures.  I have used the camera with and without the A/C adapter, and I am still on the first set three days and 40 pictures later. I also do recommend having the USB CompactFlash system to download pictures--it takes seconds to download about 8MB.  I bought a larger disk (32MB) and have used over a quarter of the pictures, and it takes less than 30 seconds to download all of the pictures--they appear quickly and clearly.  I am considering keeping the disks and just buying more like I would buy film for negatives, as the picture quality decreases when I put them into programs on my computer.","Date":"December 25, 2000"}

I have no qualms in saying picture quality is very good. My additional comments would be the same as many others; you get a lot of camera for your money in the Nikon 800. However, plan on spending an additional [sum] on a USB SmartCard reader, ...for a set of NiMH batteries and recharger (get the best, with 1600mAH capacity)... ... for a 32MB SmartCard. In fact I purchased a 64MB Sandisk card from Amazon... and on the 'normal' jpeg setting you will get 128 pictures. Finally, the carrying pouch that comes with the camera is useless as it offers zero protection against knocks.  You'll want to get something more substantial.  Other Dislikes: Plastic feel of camera body. Lense location on the far right hand side of the camera body (careful fingers!). SmardCard cover feels as if it will snap off, if even slightly mishandled. Those comments don't detract from what is still a great digital camera purchase.","Date":"March 1, 2001"}

The camera is fantastic for outdoor photography in bright sunlight but not very good for shooting indoors or in very low lightconditions. The range of the integrated flash is extremely limited and \"flahsed\" photos appear extremely cool (blue-ish). P>Minor quirks aside, I have to say that I am very happy with this camera and I have completely stopped using film cameras since I got it. As I said before, photos taken in bright sunlight look absolutely fantastic, with great colors and no artifacts (even when compressed to JPG). Also, this is one of the only cameras in this price range that has a manual mode in which you are free to tinker with almost every aspect of picture-taking. You can set manual focus, F-stops and much more. If you like to take control of your photography and don't want to spend a fortune you should definitely take a closer look at this one.Oh yeah... and get a bigger memory card (32MB+). The 8MB card shipped with this camera is inadequate for high-resolution photography. And while you're at it, get a USB card reader too.","Date":"July 3, 2001"}

This camera is my second digital camera, replacing a 640 x 480 clunker.  My choice was based on determining that 1600 x 1200 resolution would be sufficient for my needs, and the Nikon seeming to give the best pictures in that resolution range on the review sites (epinion.com, megapixel.net, etc.).  So far, this camera has not disappointed me.  The picture quality is excellent.  The quality is as good as, or better than anything I have ever gotten with a 35mm SLR.  I have gotten great compliments from photographic friends for the quality of pictures that I have emailed them that were taken with this camera.  The camera does lack aperture- or shutter-priority options, but you can finesse around that with the EV control.  I am also pleased with the black and white and VGA options.  The VGA setting is 640 x 480 resolution, but still better quality than my old one.  This is good if you only plan to email a picture to someone or use it on a web site.  I also like the ability to adjust white balance, including manual white balance adjustments.  All in all,  a great picture taking digital camera for the money.","Date":"February 1, 2001"}

The optional lenses are great and will transfer to other Nikon models later if you upgrade.I prefer the form factor of the 900/950/990 even though they are bigger, because of the way the body twists. This makes it so you can see the LCD when you're holding the camera over your head pointing down, or down by your knees pointing up.

The color, the white balance and the contrast are just spot on.  Just look at photos taken by this camera by this camera on flickr, and you'll see this thing takes some beautiful photos!! It's quick to focus, it's got great battery life and snaps photos really quick!  You won't regret buying this camera.","Date":"November 15, 2011"}

{"Title":"Amazing Camera","Author":"Donna L. Weida","ReviewID":"R144XF5X8020PP","Overall":"good","Content":"After careful searching for the right digital camera I purchased this honey.  I have been thrilled with all aspects of my Nikon Coolpix 800.  It is so lightweight (usually carried a Canon with 300 zoom lens) . . it fits in my purse.  The macro is amazing.  It was bad weather here, so I went to Meiers store and photographed . . . jelly beans, colored foil wrapped kisses, flowers, people . . . all without a flash.  They came out beautifully.  The battery life is great.  I have used mine for over two weeks and it is just now run down.  I did buy the USB card reader . . .a must have.  I also had to go to the HP web site and download a driver update for my scanner to make it work.  All in all I truly love this little camera.  I am an artist who works from photos . . . I have the whole world at my fingertips now with no waiting for processing.  Best buy for your money .  It's worth twice the price.","Date":"February 10, 2001"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 800","Author":"L. Long \"Lisa K\"","ReviewID":"R137KG3A9GXZAD","Overall":"good","Content":"I am really enjoying this camera. It is very easy to use as a point and shoot camera as well as having the manual mode for the more advanced user. I am the in between user. I have been enjoying learning how to take great shots with this camera. The paper book manual is very basic and will get you started right away. It is really easy to get started. It also has a little \"quick guide\" pamphlet so you can find basic functions fast. Then it comes with an in-depth reference manual on a CD-ROM. This I felt was a little inconvenient. I'd rather be able to page through a book quickly to find what I need, but others may like the CD-ROM manual. But I would not let that deter you from buying this camera.I bought this camera because of the higher resolution (the 2.11 megapixels) to be able to print quality photos. I plan on using Amazon's Ofoto site to have them printed as well as printing them on my Epson. Of course I love to email my photos to everyone as well. But so far the picture quality is great. Especially outdoor shots. The flash for indoor shots could be stronger. This seems to be the norm with digicams having a harder time indoors. Up close is fine but the back of the room is dark. There are ways around that using the manual mode. The software that came with the camera was very generic. So if you are very into editing, I would buy additional photo editing software.Additional things that I bought were rechargeable batteries and a charger. I drained the batteries that came with the camera in one day of usage. The LCD really drains the batteries. I also bought a 64mb compactflash card from Lexar. The 8mb is just not enough. Especially if you were to go on vacation. The Lexar card came with a jumpshot cable (a memory reader). It was very reasonabley priced. You just plug the cable into the USB port in your computer. Then you take the memory card out of the camera and put it into the reader. This helps out because you don't have to plug your camera in all the time to download your photos and it won't waste the batteries. Plus it is faster than the serial cable that comes with the camera. One thing I might mention about Lexar's jumpshot cables is that they will only read Lexar cards. But for the price of the card that included the jumpshot cable it was well worth it. And it was so easy to use.I still plan on getting a nicer case for my camera. One with more padding. And if you were go on vacation, you would need a spot for the batteries, the charger and also the software if you need to download it to a computer.All in all I am very happy with my purchase. I had been researching it more months on sites like Megapixel.net and ZDNET as well as other camera reviewing sites. The price was exceptional for the quality of this camera and I would highly recommend it.","Date":"January 27, 2001"}

{"Title":"Possibly an unfortunate fluke","Author":"Hans Kreigsman","ReviewID":"R2RKF26VY7H2A5","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 800 sounded like a great buy in a full-featured digital camera. Unfortunately, when mine arrived at my doorstep, after unpacking it and following the quick-start instructions to the letter, I took one test  photo, and the camera began to buzz and an ominous statement \"system  error\" flashed on the LCD screen. The only way I could even shut off  the camera was to open the battery bay. The comprehensive manual on CD said  that if this message appeared and a restart didn't fix the problem (it  didn't), the only action was to phone Nikon. Since this was a new camera,  right out of the box, I didn't bother, but packed it back up and returned  it the following day.  There are many good things about the camera, but in  my short time with it, other than the obvious fatal flaw, I noticed that  the battery compartment cover and smartcard cover were both very flimsy  (noted in other reviews). I feel that both of these will get extensive use  during the life of the camera and are prone to failure. Perhaps the major  fault was a fluke, but I won't be replacing this with another coolpix, or  probably with another Nikon.","Date":"March 29, 2000"}

{"Title":"Excellent Color and Detail","Author":"James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"","ReviewID":"R1PHEUOBVS5JV4","Overall":"good","Content":"I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  & small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.  JLW/991203.","Date":"December 3, 1999"}

I have had mine for a couple of months now, and it has literaly replaced my regular 35 mm camera.  I love the convience of taking pictures  then making any edits i need from my computer.  The software is easy to  install, and only has about a one hour learning curve to master.  Very good  and fast usb connection.  With a fully charged set of NI-MH, AA batteries  it gets fantastic long life.  And the 2.0 Megapixel image is nothing less  than photo film perfect, must be seen to belive.  I also like the smart  card memory media included, I have upgraded the 8 mb, to a 24 mb card, and  on the 24 mb, I can snap over 100 photos in the best quality mode on the  lower size setting, and 34 of the highest quality photos in the huge mega  resolution setting.  Another great feature is that this camera is very easy  to use compared to the other brands I have tried.  I did not even have to  read the instructions,  (though I would read them if I were a beginer).

{"Title":"Better than I expected!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R226K61WJPEXOJ","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall, this is an excellent camera and I've had nothing but great luck with it.  The pictures are terrific.I had heard a lot about the DC280  and similar digital cameras chewing up batteries, so I bought an extra set  of rechargable NiMH batteries -- in addition to the set that comes with the  camera.  While this is still a good idea, I didn't find that the battery  life was particularly bad.  On a recent trip overseas, I shot over 150  pictures (many with flash) and still had good battery life when I got home  -- enough for another 75 pictures.  Just don't use the LCD preview screen  for every shot -- that's not what it's intended for, and it WILL kill your  batteries pretty quickly.The real limitation is the Compact Flash  memory.  If you shoot the highest resolution possible, the camera will fill  a 8mb card (which is what is supplied) with only 9-12 pictures.  I  typically get 32 hi-res pictures from a 16mb card.  (The number of pictures  you get will vary depending on the complexity of the images you shoot.)  So, in addition to an extra set of rechargable batteries, think about  buying the highest capacity Compact Flash card you can afford!If you're  thinking about getting a higher resolution camera than the DC280, keep in  mind that you'll get even fewer pictures per megabyte on your Compact Flash  cards.  Personally, I found enlargements up to 5x7 printed by Ofoto nearly  impossible to tell from film pictures.  I'd only recommend a 3 megapixel  camera if you intend to print 8x10s regularly.A USB Compact Flash card  reader is a great option, too.  It saves the camera battery and allows you  to quickly download your pictures without tying up the camera.","Date":"July 26, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great for Web images","Author":"John Harris Stevenson \"tranquileye\"","ReviewID":"R274RKHULC4IZG","Overall":"good","Content":"Although it sometimes feels like we're all still beta testing various digital imaging technologies, including digital cameras, products like the Kodak DC280 make me believe the \"dark ages\" might be coming to an  end.This is a good mid-range digital camera, perfect for those who want  to capture images that will look very good on the Web. The biggest plus of  the camera is image quality; this is the best camera in this price range  that I tested, with two-megapixel resolution. Having quite a bit of  hands-on experience with various Sony cameras, I and my partner were  actually stunned by how clear the DC280's images were in a variety of  lighting conditions.There is very little to complain about in terms of  interface and usability. I scanned the manual, and then just started using  the DC280. The menu system and buttons are quite intuitive. One minor  quibble is that one is pretty much forced to use the DC280's viewfinder  left-eyed; otherwise the LCD screen smudge factor so common to digital  camera will rear its ugly head. However, I use the LCD for the majority of  my shooting, so this isn't a huge factor.The DC280 uses a USB connection  to transfer images to your computer. The camera mounts as if it were a hard  drive, and one can preview large thumbnails of images before copying them  over to your hard drive. While I was able to open the images directly into  Photoshop, Fireworks couldn't get into the camera; this may have been a  problem with how I have my file associations set up, however.The camera  comes with a number of features and extras. The bundled software, Adobe's  PhotoDeluxe and Pagemill, are more than adequate for editing images and  creating Web pages. Various simple visual effects and borders can be  applied in-camera, and you can run a slide-show right out of the camera  using the supplied video cable.The DC280 includes four rechargeable AA  batteries, a recharger, and four AA alkaline batteries. You can get started  right out of the box. My camera sucked the alkalines dry after about 50  photos and a couple of downloads; I would suggest buying an extra set of  rechargeables to carry around with you, and an AC adaptor.This is not  the perfect camera for all applications. For one thing, there are few  manual controls on the camera for focus, aperture or shutter priority, and  the optical zoom limited to 2X.  This will mean that photo enthusiasts  might want to look at something the next step up, such as the wacky-looking  Nikon Coolpix 950. As others have reported, low-light shooting is not at  the quality that one would hope for from a camera at this level.All-in-all, the DC280 is an excellent camera for the price, perfect for  Web photos.","Date":"May 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"An excellent buy!","Author":"A User","ReviewID":"R2TXQIYQ0U6EPK","Overall":"good","Content":"With this camera, you will get great colors on your screen.  I tryed the same picture with the three different qualities and with all I got excellent pictures.  It has all the basic features you might need in any camera.  It has a good zoom, the 'physical zoom' is not that good, then I discovered the digital zoom which is great.It consumes a lot of batteries, but you have more than enough with the rechargable batteries and of course, the battery charger included in the camera.  I bought an additional charger because I never found that the camera came with its own,  so don't buy another charger.I'm more than satisfied with the 8MB flash card.  It is true that you can only take 12 pictures with the highest resolution (1800x1600) and higest quality, but with standard resolution(800x600) and the medium quality you still have very good pictures and can get about 52 pictures, which is good for a weekend.  If you have a long trip and don't have a pc to download the pictures, then you might consider another flash card.BAD THINGS:  It weights a little bit more than a traditional camera of the same size, but still, it's much better that other big cameras. It doesn't come with a camera bag.  You have to buy it appart.In summary,  a great camera.","Date":"October 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent, all-around - but tough for action shots","Author":"A. Switzer","ReviewID":"RZNQ2D914YXT5","Overall":"good","Content":"I finally upgraded from my original 2 year old Digital Camera - a Casio 5000SX that was great except for a poorly designed battery door. The Kodak DC280 Zoom is better in every category - clarity, features, memory capability, analog zoom, except for one - the delay in the time from pressing the shutter until it snaps the picture. Keep in mind, that the processing time is quite fast - the Kodak is ready to take your next picture quite quickly, thanks to some in-memory processing, but the delay from when you click the button until the action is captured is quite lengthy. I find it nearly impossible to get good action shots with this camera. For example, I take quite a few pictures of sand volleyball on my weekends. Only the highest flyers - the guys that can jump out of the sand and hang like Vince Carter were captured in the air, and only with me clicking the shutter button at least 2-3 seconds *before* they jumped. However, if you don't have to take a lot of action shots, well this this is an excellent camera for the money - for both amateur and professional alike.","Date":"September 26, 2000"}

{"Title":"Outstanding Camera","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R35KM3TGNIV6JW","Overall":"good","Content":"I wanted to write a review of this camera because I hope it will help someone like myself that almost did not buy this great camera.This was my first digital camera purchase. The reason I ultimately bought it was because it was a great value--including many extra items ( both 4 alkaline and 4 NiH rechargeable batteries, battery recharger, Adobe software, UBC Cord, etc.)that the others did not.  However, I was concerned because there were reviews that mentioned that the Adobe software was difficult to use and you could not e-mail pictures using it. Both negative comments were dead wrong.First, I must say that the camera takes truely OUTSTANDING pictures.  It is also relatively easy to use.  The manual that comes with it is well written and easy to understand.  It comes with a quick-guide and you can literally be taking pictures within minutes.The Adobe software is truely outstanding too.  Its only negative is it does not come with a manual so you have to plow through the instructions on the computer and very often use the help screen. However, you can make all kinds of adjustments to your pictures and come out with a first rate pictures.  I like to save the pictures to my hard drive in the JEP format. If I want to e-mail them, I simply  send the pictures as attachments from there.  No problem.Regardless, the pictures and the software are great and any negative comments you may read from others probably are from first time buyers like myself who got frustrated with the learning curve and time it takes to get to know a new camera, new technology, how to use the software and how to print photographs.  For a novice, it takes considerable time to learn.  There are no shortcuts. However, once you get the hang of it, you get  fantastic results!!!One mistake I made was buying a card reader.  I have a 800mh processor and the USB cable that comes with the camera literally takes seconds to transfer.  If you have a slow processor, you may need a card reader.One thing  I definitely advise you to get is an AC adaptor.  It is a must or you will drain the batteries.  If you are going to go for a long weekend or plan to take a considerable number of pictures, you may want to buy both extra rechargeable batteries and an extra picture card.Ihave a HP deskjet 952 printer.  I have found some Kodak 4X6 borderless print paper.  It comes with one or two pictures per page.  For the single page, I turn it upside down in my tray (with the Kodak name up) and locate it all the way to the far right.  I set the settings just the way the instructions say and I get the most unbelieveable pictures you can imagine.  Once I got the hang of it, people in my office asked me where I was getting them developed! Another major positive is that Kodak has a \"technical help desk.\" I called them a couple of times regarding how to use the new paper with my particular printer.  They have an 800 number,answered right away, and were incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  This was a major plus and helped me over several frustrating humps.Regardless, this camera is a great value since it inclues many extras and provides outstanding quality pictures.  Beginers do need to invest time--and be forewarned it can get very frustrating but it all falls into place with time.  If you are on the fence, buy it.  You will love it!Enjoy!!","Date":"November 22, 2000"}

As much as I'd like to stay with my old SLR, it's time to move from film to disk. I've had the Kodak 280 for 3 months and I'll say that it was a good buy. The pictures are very good,  it's easy to use - just point and click. As with any automatic camera, you  don't have great control over exposure and lens settings, but for indoor  and typical outdoor shots, its fine. The USB downloads fast compared to  serial. The rechargeable batteries dye after about 30 downloaded pictures  to your PC... get the optional AC cable (I think 39$). Everything digital  is overpriced for what it is. My camera does sometimes act quirky; but I  think it always has to do with low batteries. You'll have to get another  set of the rechargeable nickel metal hybrid batteries if you go on the road  with your camera. And the software is ok. The downloading should be easier  when you don't want to touch up your photos.I'll keep my 35 mm SLR for  those vacation trips where I'll take 10 rolls of film and I want more  camera control, but if you want instant, good quality pictures in an  everyday, take it anywhere camera (as long as you don't need more than 35  pictures before downloading), this is the camera.

Some of these, I've taken duplicate pictures with 35mm or APS, and the colors on this camera (DC280) comes out way ahead.A case in point, one ocean picture by the DC280 showed detail in the distant fog, along with varying reflections (of the fog) on the water. Dark blue sky filled in behind and above the fog.  The APS picture was all washed out - you could hardly tell the difference between the fog and sky. Both were taken with automatic exposure settings, and taken within 1 minute of each other.Down side to this camera is that 1) It eats through baterries (common problem to these types of cameas - fortunately Koday supplies NiMH rechargable batteries); 2) Limited zoom range; and 3) LCD display gets washed out in the sunlight.Up side to this camera are 1) Excellent sharpness in prints up to 5x7 - okay in 8x10; 2) Colors that will knock your socks off (much better than the Nikon Coolpix 950 that I use at work); 3) It acts and feels like a real camera; 4) Software and Camera operations are very natural and easy to learn (I'm still stuggling with the Nikon, and I'm a computer engineer!)Bottom line: This is an excellent entry into the digital world.

I end up having to cut off the ends to make a printable 4x6, so the picture is actually 1.7 mega pixels instead of 2.0; the auto flash gets confused easily and I find myself having to use the manual flash and risking red-eye;  the software needs a lot of improvement, it's not user friendly and crashes my computer now and then... but it's free; action pictures come out fuzzy and many great shots have been lost becasue they were out of focus.This camera has been great and I would recommend it to anyone.

Before I go on, let me warn you that this model has been replaced by the Kodak 3400.  However, I see no significant improvement and they include less in the box with the 3400 (no rechargeable battreries).Let me talk about the camera.  It is very simple to use, yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers.  The annoying feature that makes me give this a 4 star rating is the location of the LCD screen - I found that if I use my right eye (which is my dominant eye) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the LCD screen and smudges it.  Come on Kodak, that was a goof.  This does not effect the quality of piuctures, its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the LCD clean.Other than that, it is terrific.  I immediately purchased a Sandisk 32 meg compactflash card, and have since ordered a 128 mb card ....  Battery life is long (I do use the power save mode, which is not on by default).A few tips.  Once you experience digital photography you'll discover that, just like videos, things work best without flash unless you absolutely need it.  Also, this does have a limited telephoto power with just a 2x optical lens - not a problem for me, but you need to know what you want (if you want much more than 2X, I think you should look at an SLR model).Buy this one, its a great value.","Date":"October 22, 2000"}
{"Title":"Comparing Kodak DC280 and Fuji Finepix","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2ZLTJTXCRGWUX","Overall":"good","Content":"I had narrowed my digital camera search down to the Fuji Finepix and the  Kodak DC280 since I wanted one in the $450 range, and was impressed with  the resolution and compactness of a friend's Fuji camera. Since I was only  able to view the cameras over the internet, I chose the Kodak since I  figured the better resolution and features would be worth the extra $50.  But after receiving it, I realise that I would have gone with the Fuji  Finepix had I seen the Kodak in person. The Kodak is much bulkier, and the  lens cap has to be manually replaced and is easily knocked off the minute  you put it in your backpack (actually the stupid thing is always falling  off!). I reckon for the better price, the resolution of the Fuji is  perfectly adequate, and the slimness of the Fuji and it's sliding lens  cover are very convenient. Go with the Fuji!","Date":"September 3, 2000"}

Photo quality is excellent, and I was taking photos only minutes out of the box.  The trouble started when I loaded the Adobe PhotoDeluxe 1.0 that shipped with the camera-- I can't seem to transfer photos to email, and frankly, this is the major need of the camera for me.  In fact, when I try to transfer to email, the program locks up and so does my computer, which was 192 megs of RAM and Pentium II at 350.  So, buy the camera if you want ease of use and great photos, but watch out for the Adobe software.  If I can't get this fixed, it's all going back.","Date":"October 18, 2000"}

{"Title":"This is by far the best digital camera out there.","Author":"\"johnrocker74\"","ReviewID":"R2C8K86GKTK7YR","Overall":"good","Content":"I just got mine in the mail on Friday and I must have taken about 300 pictures already (mostly of my cat who now feels like Cindy Crawford).  The pictures (mostly indoors) look spectacular.  I love the fact that I can  preview and chose the pictures I like.  I have been a long time 35 mm user  but I think my Canon EOS will now have to retire for good.The camera is  very easy to figure out. I have never even picked up a digital camera  before this one, but it only took me 20 minutes to figure everything out.  The controls are clear and easy to understand.  I was amazed by the quality  of pictures (both indoors and outdoors).  The camera winds into place ready  to take another picture within seconds (I understand this is a big problem  with some other digital cameras, even the KodaK 290 which is far more  expensive, that take forever to get ready for the next picture).  Focusing  is as easy as with my Canon and I was able to preview the pictures right  away, first on the camera, then on my computer and finally as a slide show  on my TV (great feature for family gatherings). You can also see what a  picture would look like before you even take it. I also managed to use the  framing feature for some cool effects, as well as the B&W feature to  make some of my cat's picture look very \"astistic\".  There are  several other features (like the ability to record date and time on the  Picture)  but it would take too much time and space to mention.Now the  bad things.  Battery life is miserably short, and if you plan to use the  screen in the back of the camera to review your pics, then good luck. You  definetely need to get an AC adapter  so when you are reviewing your  pictures at home, you don't waste batteries.  And when you go out take at  least 2 set of baterries with you.  The software that came with the camera  crashed my computer a few times (and I have a 600Mhz Pentium III).  I  understand there are some downloads that I need to get, so maybe that will  fix the problem.  And my big complaint, I payed so much money for camera,  but all I got with it was a measly 8mb card that holds less than 20  pictures. I had to shell another $140 for a 64 Mb flash card so I can take  as many pictures as I want (well, not really, I think it is about  100)Overall though, this camera is perfect for beginners (who never used  a digital camera before) and experts.  I highly recommend it.","Date":"April 30, 2000"}

Sell you film developing stock, because at the rate these cameras are improving, film will shortly go the way of the Victorola and the telegraph. The DC280  is small, fits well in your hand, does EVERYTHING film point-and-shoot  cameras do, including a modest zoom capability (for framing), and much  more.  You can preview your pictures and discard them on the spot, thus  saving room for more pictures.  You can get a 96MB Compact flash memory  card (think of it as the \"film\" of a digital camera) which will  hold hundreds of pictures, (great for vacations when you don't take your  computer).  The flash recharges quickly, the LCD lets you frame the actual  picture, the viewfinder works well when you want to conserve your  batteries, and the auto focus is flawless.  Kodak maintains a web page and  I have already upgraded the \"firmware\" (the cameras operating  system).  The pictures, even at the large 8\" x 10\" are stunning.  If you can't get great pictures with this camera, stick to buying  postcards.It comes with everything you need to get going, including  alkaline batteries to start you snapping, while the included rechargeables  are charging in the included charger.  The only things I have since ordered  are the DC adapter and a nice case to keep my camera safe.  I love it!","Date":"April 3, 2000"}

It is well built, has great optics, a 2X true zoom, decent battery use, USB support and enough user controls to make it an acceptable camera for a semi-serious photographer. The resolution is more than adequate for internet apps and good enough for printing clear 8 x 10s. It is also very sturdy.

I also purchased an Olympus D340R for a friend, and  although it is only 1.3 Megapixels, the color is much better, the pictures  blow up almost as well, despite the lower res., and the LCD display is  sharper and easier to view in daylight. Considering the huge difference in  price, the Olympus is a bargain. Of course it does not zoom, but you can  hardly call the 60mm of the Kodak a real zoom. Having used zoom lenses on  35mm SLRs for years I can testify that the 30 to 60 zoom is more like  medium wide angle to normal view, rather than true zoom. You will have to  buy an accessory 2X lens and adapter to get true + zoom. If you want a less  expensive, good performing, zoom camera, check out the Olympus D450 Zoom.","Date":"January 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"digital kodachrome","Author":"Nick \"ndoble\"","ReviewID":"RVELR0HC5962G","Overall":"good","Content":"Have you ever taken Kodachrome slides - the color saturation is upped a little, as is the contrast; everything is a little realer than real.  And why not. Kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color,  and they have applied it to their new-fangled digital cameras.  You will  not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor - can a  digital camera really be this good?  It looks like a Kodachrome slide -  heck, it looks better!Printing is another thing.  The reason pro  photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the  range of contrast is much greater than prints - prints can only reflect  light, not generate it, as can a slide projector or computer monitor.  So a  great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light; and as even your  basic printer can print at 300 dpi, the lower resolution of the digital  camera makes its effects felt.  However, I find 8x10 prints at the highest  resolution of the DC280 quite acceptable (using a HP832c).  But the camera  cannot make uncompressed files - all files are JPEG compressed to some  extent, and the artifacts may show.  This is a point and shoot camera;  no control of focus, shutter speed, or aperture is possible. The camera is  a little heavy, and you wish for hooks for a neck strap. You wish for more  buttons on the body of the camera, rather than having to go through levels  of menus.  The lens front is very vulnerable (and the lens cap is not  automatic) - it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding  metal or plastic guard, as some of Kodak's competitors do.I find the  battery life using Kodak's supplied metal hydride batteries quite  acceptable, particularly if you buy a second set; but the supplied  alkalines lasted only through the evening I bought the camera.I am a  wide angle person rather than a telephoto person, but in an ideal world, a  3x rather than a 2x would be welcome - 60mm (equiv.) is hardly telephoto.  This is basically a wide angle to normal lens.I've been a darkroom  photographer since 1952, and a sometime professional since 1959 - I am  delighted to see the end of chemical photography, with its dangerous  chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results  in color.  Now all you need is a digital camera and an ink-jet printer.  Prices are falling - give it a try!","Date":"June 15, 2000"}

The colors, resolution and exposure are all  excellent. The controls are easy to use and make the learning process swift  for this camera.  The only negatives I can think of is: 1) the battery life  is short and 2) while running high resolution you will only get about 12  frames with the included 8mb card. If you purchase this camera I would  recommend a higher capacity card and an extra set of rechargable batteries.  I have connected this camera to a Windows 98 machine (a snap) and to a  Windows NT machine (not recommended because NT doesn't support USB) and to  a Windows 2000 machine.  On Windows 98, the installation was a breeze and I  was up and running in no time.  On Windows 2000, I had a bit of trouble  getting the camera to work properly.  It will not work out of the box but  once you install the necessary patch from Kodak it works fine.  To Kodak's  credit they don't advertise the camera as 2000 compatible but it would be  nice if they would update their software or instructions for folks that  need to use the camera with a 2000 machine.  I have no problem endorsing  this camera for Windows 98 users.  It is a great camera.","Date":"September 1, 2000"}

The Sony is the only one with no Zoom, but has the best picture quality and the best  lowlight exposure. There is also the DSCF505 which has the huge 3xzoom  lens, but it is too big to be nice. The Sony is also the smallest and the  easiest to use. The operating system is similar to the DV camcorders. The  second best is the Olympus C-2020 due to its zoom lens, the viewfinder and  just weaker in low light conditions. The 130 pictures will fit onto a 64MB  Smartmedia in HQ, a little more than with Sony. The Kodak I liked the  least, mostly because of its klunky operating system and the poor colors  (in comparison).

I've e-mailed several photos to friends  and they are all amazed at how clear and sharp they are!

The DC280 is similar in size and  weight to my regular (35 mm) camera.  So far, the only 'negative' thing I  can say about this camera is that the LCD window does get constantly  smudged by my nose when looking through the viewfinder -- but it's really  no big deal.

{"Title":"Happy happy joy joy","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1OTAUXW1G45SK","Overall":"good","Content":"Within 10 minutes (thanks to the included batteries) I was taking photos.  The camera's interface is clear and understandable.  I suppose if you're challenged by a disposable camera, you might not get it, but if you are a  normal human, you can do this.  On the PC side, if you can open a file in  Word/Wordperfect, you can get to your photos.  With the USB interface, it  was more plug-and-play (emphasis on play) that I'd expected.  I expected an  hour or two to learn the \"how to's\", but hey, this is easy.  I'm  a LAN manager and ex-semi pro photographer in college, so I was less than  enthusiastic when my wife said we should get one.  But now that we have it,  I love the instant gratification that the DC 280 has.  Yes, the resolution  is not as good as film, but unless you're a real pro or have a need for  prints larger than 8x10, who cares?  I'm filling up my digital photo album  so quickly that I'm gonna need a CD burner.  Ok, bad stuff: your nose (if  you're right eye'd like most) smudges the LCD.  If you use it a lot, you'll  need more batteries but so do other cameras.  Hmm.. that's about it.  Last  words-I have no hesitation giving this camera a \"buy\"  recommendation.

The camera arrived two days before the birth of my grandson so I had very little time to learn how to use it before I started taking pictures in the hospital. It didn't matter. The camera was really easy to use and the results were amazing. The pictures actually seem sharper than ordinary film photgraphs. I've been using the medium quality, high resolution mode which gives me seventeen pictures on the 8MB card. So far I've blown the pictures up to 5X7 and they have great detail. When my grandson was 4 days old, I took some more pictures and used the built-in \"new baby\" frame feature. People could not believe the professional quality of the prints. By the way, I am using an HP 932C DeskJet printer with HP glossy paper with excellent results.

{"Title":"One of our most terrific decisions ever","Author":"C. Antonsen","ReviewID":"RRTZS6P72YVGJ","Overall":"good","Content":"was to purchase the Kodak DC280.  We did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera, including reading reviews of many different digitals from customers on Amazon and other sites.  We quickly learned what the major issues of importance to us would be:  (1) picture quality; (2) battery life; (3) convenience/ease of use; and (4) overall value, considering 1-3.  We decided on the DC280 because of the features, above average customer reviews, and the price.That said, we remained a bit concerned about battery life and convenience.  As you can see from all the reviews, digital cameras (this one included) have the reputation for eating batteries and we didn't want to trade film and development costs for battery expense and the hassle of always changing and buying them.  Take this as gospel:  if you do not use the LCD screen as a viewer to set up your shots, you will enjoy surprisingly long battery life.  We regularly snap more than 100 shots (a week's worth or more) and then pass the camera around to let everyone review them on the LCD screen.  The batteries last if you just take reasonable, minimal care, and with an extra set of rechargables you will probably never feel the crunch, even as snap-happy tourists on vacation somewhere.Second, we had read that upper-end cameras (in the $600-1,000 range) could snap pictures rapidly one after another but that cameras such as the DC280 had an infuriatingly long lag time from one shot to the next--up to 12 to 15 seconds--while the camera processed and saved the data.  We braced ourselves for this inconvenience.  STUPID US!  It took two weeks before we realized by accident that you can take up to four or five pictures in very rapid succession before finding the need to cool it for a few seconds.  That is fine, and since we're not professionals needing to do rapid bursts for sports shots all day, we find no difference compared with how strenuously we used our film cameras (in fact, we get a whole lot more out of this one than our film cameras).There is a lot more I could go on about, but the short of it is that this camera is amazing and has itself dispelled many falsehoods we read about cameras in its price range (and higher).  We have two little children and buying film, developing it, making duplicates, and mailing them out to family everywhere had become a real financial burden and hassle.  Consequently, we barely took any pictures anymore.  With the DC280 now, we have snapped more than 600 pictures in 5 weeks (the equivalent of 25 rolls, $250 for film and development).  Everyone in our family already has a CD with 500 pictures on it, with more on the way.  And we now have photos for our own collection that we otherwise would never have had.If you have any doubts about which digital camera to choose anywhere near this price range, jump at this one before you miss out.  You'll love it.","Date":"November 28, 2000"}

Pictures taken  outdoors were exceptional in all respects (color, clarity and detail).  Pictures taken indoors are always more challenging due to lighting  conditions,  but the DC-280 has more than enough exposure compensation  adjustments for your use that there is  really no reason for bad picture  quality.  It does take a little practice to take consistently good indoor  pictures,  but it has a great owners/instruction manual that is very easy  to read and follow.The rechargable batteries are a must with digital  cameras as these cameras draw a lot of current with the LCD monitor  activated.  I would also recommend purchasing a larger Compact  Flash Card,  as the one sold with the camera is only 8Mb.  I purchased an additional  32Mb card which now gives me enough capicity for many pictures (over 200 at  a medium resolution).I have taken a number of pictures at the highest  resolution setting and proceeded to print them on my HP Photo quality  printer using Photo quality paper and have been delighted  with the  results.  I print most of them in the 5\" X 7\" format size and the  results have been amazing with virtually no  visable pixellation.  It is  very hard to tell these photos  from conventional film photography.

USB is obviously the way to go, but  serial is tolerable.Then I use any editing software (a version of Adobe  Photo Deluxe is included and not bad, but I like MS PhotoDraw 2000) to  resize, color-fix, etc. You can go nuts manipulating the pictures, but odds  are you won't need to. I've used the camera in bright sun, low-light and  everything in between and haven't been able to fool it yet.Cool nifty  feature - the self running slide show. Hook it up to your PC, or even a TV  or VCR (again, cable included), and you can let the camera scroll through  all the shots on your memory card. My 2 year old loves watching it, and it  beats Barney, right? One tip - get an AC adapter if you plan to spend much  time hooked up to your PC/MAC or TV. No sense wasting precious battery  juice when you don't have to.Complaints? The flash, viewfinder, and  light sensors all line up right where I want to put my fingers, so I'm  re-learning how to hold a camera. Also, there's a brightness dial on the  bottom of the camera for the LCD display. I always seem to slide it  accidentally. The result looks like a thermo-scan of Junior and Fluffy in  the back yard, but it's only the LCD. The image itself is still fine.For the price of a good 35 MM camera body, get yourself a great digital  companion or primary camera. Now if we could just get Nikon to make a  digital camera that takes all my old lenses for under $1,000...","Date":"June 27, 2000"}

The pictures are unbelievable... and I mean that. If I print a 4\"x6\" on my HP 952C it is hard to tell the difference from a 35mm camera.Function: The  camera could use a better design but it is still much better than some  other ones I have tried. The review screen is perfectly placed where your  nose hits it when you are taking a picture so I am constantly cleaning it  off.In high quality mode mine holds about 30 pictures (20meg card).  This is plenty for most events/photo ops. After I take 3-5 pictures I go  back and review them and delete the ones that I don't like. This way, when  you have 30 pictures in your card they are 30 pictures that you like. Much  better that taking a whole roll of 35mm pictures and only liking 5 of them  once they are developed.Overall I love the camera (and so do all my  friends that try it).","Date":"May 11, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Camera for the First Time Digital Camera User/Buyer","Author":"The Shealy's","ReviewID":"R3VMH1RQ55P1XR","Overall":"good","Content":"This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased and with so many choices on the market I was very concerned about deciding which camera was the best for me.  After reading all the reviews on Amazon.com I decided on the Kodak DC 280 and what a GREAT choice.The camera is VERY easy to use.  I am digital camera stupid and even I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening the box.MEMORY.  I took the advice of most reviewers and bought a 32MB flash card.  A very good decision which I highly recommend.  What none of the reviews told me was that the 32MB card holds about 50 pictures when you have the camera on the highest reslution.  If you go for medium or lower resolution you of course get a lot more. I just use my camera for everyday pictures and the 32 MB card is just fine.SOFTWARE.  You must have software to download the pictures from the camera.  The DC 280 comes with Kodak's camera control software, a very simple picture manipulation software called Arcsoft, and Adobe's photodeluxe 2.0 and Adobe pageMill 3.0.  The Arcsoft program is baby simple and I was using it with no problem to do my first picture downloads.  It even lets you do basic picture manipulation.  If you just want to take pictures for everyday memories or internet postings then this is all the software you will ever need.  I was a little scared that the PhotoDeluxe software would be to complicated to use so I didn't download it till last week.  Turns out It too is a piece of cake to operate and its much more powerful than the Arcsoft software. I now use the Photodeluxe software over the Arcsoft. Bottomline, the software that comes with the camera is VERY easy to use and unless you are a big time or serious photographer its all the software you need.DONLOADING PICTURES.  I download pictures directly from the camera to the computer and its doable but slow, especially if you downloading the entire memory card.  My next purchase is to buy one of those flash card readers which other reveiwers recommend.BATTERIES.  The camera comes with one set (4) rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  I would definately get a second set of rechargeable batteries, but not another recharger.  As long as you have one set of batteries ready to go you will be fine.  And if you don't have any batteries recharged ready to go you can always use regular batteries.  If you take pictures using the normal and recommended \"Capture\" mode the batteries will last through an entire 32MB memory card - no problem. Plus they only take a couple of hours to recharge.CHARGER.  If you do not get one of those flash card readers I would difinately buy the AC/DC adapter.  When you download pictures directly from the camea you are using up battery power.  It would be much easier to plug the adapter into the camera instead of having to change out batteries which typically happens to me somewhere in the middle of downloading my pictures.CASE.  The camera doesn't come with a case and I wish I had one.  I would recommend you buy one.BOTTOMLINE.  I recommend you buy this camera, a 32 MB memory card, a memory card reader, an extra set of rechargeable batteries, an AC/DC adapter, and a case.","Date":"January 1, 2001"}

This camera gave me good results on a recent trip to Europe.* the battery life is just fine if you are good about turning off the camera.  I took over 80 photos before I needed to change the batteries, and was not too stingy with the review mode.  That is not great but certainly not as bad as I was led to beleive.*  the little screen does get smudged with your nose a lot, unless you are super careful.  Get used to it.* The software isn't that great, but there are a lot of shareware or freeware programs out there to look manipulate pictures with.* The camera is not very good for action shots, but that was not a major issue with me.* the camera is a little bit big, compared to say the Canon Elph, but not really too big or heavy.This camera is very good value for the money, I might even rate it higher depending on the relative price of a few other cameras.  Overall I was extremely pleased with the quality of the pictures from my DC 280, and my wife was quite impressed with the picture quality as well.

If you are going to use a cardreader instead of direct input from the camera, the kodak software is useless.

{"Title":"Good value, usability problems, poor Mac interface","Author":"Henry M. Halff","ReviewID":"R20KSSY95YLJ86","Overall":"good","Content":"The camera produces excellent pictures, but has some usability problems. For a two-megapixel camera, the price is excellent. The usability problems vary in seriousness. The power switch has only one resting position and  hence doesn't indicate the power-up status of the camera. There is a  power-saving mode, but no power-down after a period of inactivity. The lens  cap is an old fashioned plastic disk that must be manually placed over the  lens; even my old QuickTake 150 had an integrated power switch and lens  cap. The unit also struck me as being rather heavy. The interface to  Windows computers is excellent. Retrieving photos is as easy as opening a  volume that automatically mounts on the computer. Particularly useful is a  camera control application that makes for easy adjustment of all the  camera's settings. Mac users are not so fortunate. Pictures must be  retrieved with a special Picture Transfer Application with an exceptionally  bad interface and inexcusably slow operation. There is no camera control  application for the Macintosh. The camera has some formatting features such  as borders and special effects. It also provides for video output. I  haven't tested these features and can't comment on their usefulness.","Date":"June 26, 2000"}

{"Title":"Excellent Camera - Good Value","Author":"Technogirl","ReviewID":"R4MNHLO5MIBKK","Overall":"good","Content":"I've done some research on the Kodak series, and this is the best value so far. There are very few good digital cameras in this price range...that have the features that I need. It has a 2 megapixel resolution, easy to use LCD display, and it uses a Compact Flash card. It's also fairly easy to use.Did I mention the pictures? Wow. I used to have a Pansonic digital camera and it wasn't as good as this DC280, (okay, so it was only a 1.3 megapixel). The picture quality is excellent. I really don't have to modify the images, sharpen them, or adjust the lighting within Photoshop. I basically crop the pictures, and send them out.A really nice add on was the rechargeable batteries and recharger that were included with the DC280. Of course, it came with 4 AA standard batteries, too. :-) You can also buy a lens adapter so you can add on different lenses, such as super wide angle and telephoto lenses.A reviewer did mention that the LCD screen is in an awkward place, so your nose does smudge it quite a bit. Also, sometimes the lens cap falls off the camera lens, but it is attached to the camera at least, so at least you won't lose it.I purchased a 64 MB compactflash card to replace the 8 MB card that came with it. You should try to purchase it on-line... Amazon had it cheaper. I also bought a USB Compactflash card reader which was so much easier and faster to use than downloading the images from the camera (the DC280 also supports USB).If Amazon doesn't have the camera in stock, you can find it at Buy.com--it'll take a few days to get it. I believe it's the previous model before the DC3400, so it might be difficult to find now...You're better off buying this on-line instead.","Date":"December 12, 2000"}

I did some research before I bought, but I'm not an expert on any of the technical stuff.I can say that as a beginner, I have found that all of the basic functions are intuitive. I played around with the camera before getting out the instructions, and realized I had figured out most of the most necessary functions.No software package works on everyone's machine, but the software installed very simply and easily on mine and I haven't had a single problem with it (I run Windows XP Home edition).The part that I had the most reservations about was the actual connection and upload to the computer. Most people have used a camera; but obviously I had never hooked one up to my machine before!It couldn't have been easier. I simply read in the instructions which slot the USB plug went into on the camera -- I had already plugged it into my computer -- turned the camera mode to \"connect\" and flipped it on. Windows recognized the camera, and the photo wizard in XP allows very easy transfer into a folder of your choosing. You can also get the photos directly from the camera and bypass the wizard, but I haven't felt the need to do that.The photos themselves have pretty good color -- I do have to up the contrast more often than not in Paint Shop Pro, but that's not a big deal. The colors, if the light isn't that great, tend to be a little washed out, just like a regular camera.Overall, I love my new camera and have found nothing to complain about. It has performed beautifully and it's easy to use. I recommend this camera to any newbie who wants a middle-of-the-line machine.","Date":"March 21, 2003"}

I alsobought a H.P. printer for under ($). You loose some resolution with digital , but the color is astounding. More importantly you can crop and fix up pictures so that the photos you do print ( I do 2 on an 8 1/2 by 11) are perfect for a photo album. I also get clear plastic sleeves ( Office Max) that have holes for binder and protect picture.Also there is an abundance of on-line storage sites to park pictures you don't print ( Freedrive.com is one site). There is a learning curve with the software ( must save photos in jpeg format to e-mail), but it is not that difficult. The USB download capability is very important and makes downloading get done in under a minute. I had some fear after I bought it that I wouldn't be able to figure everything out, but I am very pleased one month into my ownership. You will need battery recharger and 4 extra batteries to rotate into camera, but this is not a significant cost. Again, the color resolution is outstanding and the ability to edit the photos ( crop, enhance, lighten or darken) allows for a lot of creativity.

The only drawbacks are minor.. Kodak could have spent a little more time on the lense cap design, as it comes off easily and a regular neck strap would be better than the hand strap. My recommendations are to upgrade to at least an additional 20mb flash card, consider an extra set of rechargeable batteries and possibly a card reader. Even without the above, the camera functions solidly. You can even view your photos on your TV in a slide show with the provided cable!

They only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above 5x7 (8x10 takes a dip in quality).Overall a very good camera for an enry level to average user.If you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs, you might checkout the Nikon coolpix 900 series, a very good camera, though it is twice the price of the Kodak 280 zoom.","Date":"January 11, 2002"}

I've shot a good 600 pictures from a 120 degree Arizona summer to a -22 degree Massachusetts Nor'easter. It's been bumped, knocked, and dropped and still takes pictures as good as when it came out of the box.The use is simple enough for even a manager (like myself) to use. Most of the time I just point and shoot and the pictures come out just fine. I like being able to manually adjust the exposure because I find myself inside and not allowed to use the flash. Most of these indoor pic's come out fine.I'm about to graduate to a higher pixel camera but will pass my faithful Kodak onto my son. I just hope I can find another unit as tough and reliable as my 280.","Date":"January 7, 2002"}

{"Title":"More Than Meets The Eye","Author":"Anthony Harmon \"HarmMac\"","ReviewID":"R31XSFCFXHEPWY","Overall":"good","Content":"The Kodak DC280 is exactly what a serious SOHO user or amateur photographer should be looking at as their bottom-line diigital camera. I researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and  price to come available. When I saw the DC280 for $447.00 (compared to the  near-$700 it was a few months ago), I knew the time was right and pulled  the trigger...Everything I need in a personal/professional camera is  basically here. The photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything  you'd expect. When people see a photo from the DC280 printed on the HP970C,  they are taken aback at how good it really looks. One of the greatest  sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the  quality of the paper that was used. I have hundreds of family photographs  from the 1940's to 1999, which vary widely in how clear they look. But no  matter how good the best studio photographer's shot looks, it cannot  surpass the clarity of the DC280's best pictures.The DC280 is not a  perfect camera. There are saturation problems, as well its greedy use of  batteries. The 8MB FlashCard that comes included has to be one of the  reasons the camera is so inexpensive, along with there not being any AC  adapter included.The Kodak software works perfectly in Windows 2000, but  is flakey in Windows 98 SE. However, one hidden bonanza came to light when  I used ThumbsPlus 4.1 to acquire the images off the camera; you can save  them as lossless TIFF files instead of the default JPEG files that the  camera uses.This camera will help my business and will help me be as  creative as I want to be. It was worth every penny I spent. You should give  it a try as well...","Date":"July 3, 2000"}

This is my first digital camera and I had read and heard that they could be difficult to use.  In no way was this true.  All you need to do is just follow the instructions and it works like a charm.  I use Windows ME and although the software that comes with the camera does not support it all I had to do was go to the Kodak site and after a quick download of the ME software it works without a hitch.  The Adobe PhotoDeluxe software that comes with the camera is also easy to install, has many features for changing your pictures, fixing mistakes, adding special effects, etc.  Once I got everything installed I was able to take a picture, download it and enjoy it all in less time than it will take to read this review and thats on my FIRST try!

This camera is special. I have tried many other cameras & though this is not a high resolution camera, the photos come out great, at times even better than high megapixel cameras. Though it does eat the battery power quickly, I do not have any complaints as I use the Kodak rechargeable batteries, which have lasted me for a long time. I'm currently using the third installment (you need 4 batteries) of the Kodak rechargeable batteries. Plus since they are AA size, those batteries can be used with other cameras or light devices.I know that this camera is not available for sale.

I don't quite know why this series of cameras take such amazingly sharp pictures (my 240 (1.2 MP) takes sharper photos than my 3.2 MP sony!!!)but they just do.  The 280 has a more limited zoom (2x as opposed to a 3x), but the picture quality is amazing.  You cannot buy a 2MP camera that takes sharper and more realistic pictures than the 280.  The new Kodak series with the docking ports are made differently and they are not as good about focusing or sharpness of image.  The 280 is a great investment!! I've seen prints from the 280 looking better than some 4MP cameras!! And that's all I have to say about that :)","Date":"September 16, 2003"}

However, when I went to buy the 290, it was not in stock.  Because I absolutely HAD TO HAVE my new camera that very night, I purchased the DC280.  And I'm glad I did.  It is very easy to use.  You can figure it out without having to read the instructions.  And it takes great pictures - day or night!  The clarity is excellent and comparable to a 35mm.  I've only printed pictures up to 4x6 so far, but they turned out wonderful.  It comes with everything you need to start taking pictures right away - an 8 MB card, rechargeable batteries, a battery charger, and alkaline batteries so you don't have to wait for the others to charge before using your camera.  I bought a card reader so I wouldn't run down the batteries while loading the files to my computer.  I also bought a 64 MB CompactFlash card.  On standard quality, it stores almost 300 pics and on high quality, about 105.  I use the sight finder instead of the LCD display to take pictures and have found that my batteries last quite a while.The DC280 is my third digital camera and by far the best!","Date":"October 29, 2001"}

I have enjoyed it much and definitely like it better than my wife's 35mm camera.You can develop hardcopy photos 4X6's through Kodak for $ each and they have looked great for me so far.  Mostly though I just keep the photos on my computer or send them in emails to friends.  2 Megapixels makes for great looking photos and allows me to crop or re-size them to make jpeg files that fit my 19 inch monitor's resolution and that still look very good.I like it that you can see your photo instantly on the small display screen, although it is pretty small and still hard to see if you caught that smile.Also there are no processing costs or time spent waiting for processing as you can use your USB port.  It takes about a second per photo to download to your computer.  I did have problems with the USB with my old computer that would cause it to reboot and then work, but now my new Windows2000 PC works excellent with the Kodak camera and USB.The 8MB card that comes with it is too small in storage capacity, and I am planning to get a 32MB very soon. The 8MB card holds at minimum 12 high res photos.There is about a one second delay between when you push the button and when the camera flashes the photo, so you have to wait and hold the camera still so it is not so good for moving objects or sports events.Also the zoom is good but not good enought for the sports events I go to for great distant shots.  The zoom lenses broke on my first Kodak 280 and they sent me a new one the same day I sent they old one back.So overall the experience has been very good with this camera and I have alot of great photos to prove it.","Date":"March 30, 2001"}

I inherited it in like new condition. I'm a \"moderate-advanced amateur\" photographer, own several cameras including a Sony/Minolta DSLR. This camera, as others have noted, takes VERY good pictures and is well made and easy to operate. Many times higher resolution just isn't needed, especially if you do a lot of web photography like I do. Put an upgraded CF card in it (a CF slot instead of SD/XD/whatever are another sign of quality) and you're good for hundreds or even thousands of shots!The only down side is that it *is* slow by today's standards. Its highest ISO is only 200 if I remember correctly (maybe not even that high), and CF write times are a bit on the long side. The proprietary USB/Serial connector is annoying in 2011, the original cable for mine is long gone and you can't use a standard USB cable - which isn't a real big problem since I generally use a card reader anyway.I'd say this camera is much better built, and takes better pictures than most of the sub $100 \"blister pack\" cameras out there - as long as 2MP is enough resolution.","Date":"November 22, 2011"}

You just need to prepare--I always take at least three sets of batteries, a few cards and a quick charger wherever I go. One great thing about the 280 is that it uses AA batteries. Try finding a propritary battery in Cozumal Mexico.  The shots I have taken always receive praise about the clarity and color, even at low compression rates.  Part of my job is to put together a newsletter. We just started trying out a Nikon Coolpix 5000 camera for going out and getting newspaper quality snapshots. Not to badmouth Nikon or anything, but everyone wants to go back to the Kodak for it's simplicity and guaranteed results.I'm looking for a small pocket size camera like the elph because of it's portability.

Take it out of the box, scan  through the instructions, point, zoom and shoot. The digital zoom works  fine, and the special effects (especially black and white) are fun.Two  features of digital photography are an absolute joy: first, the ability to  review your shot right away, and discard it if it's not perfect (leading to  much higher quality end results without wasting lots of money on film); and  second, the way to drop the flashcard from the camera straight into a PDA  (I have an HP Jornada running Pocket PC) for an instant pocket photo  collection. This passes the stringent test of \"would have been science  fiction just a little while ago\".Here's the word of warning: I have a  Dell laptop running Windows NT. The connection from the camera to the PC is  very erratic. Kodak's helpline support was very good - they advise lowering  the transfer rate on the COM1 port by forcing it not to find the camera (ie  disconnecting it and waiting for the dialog box). This does work, but means  you have to wait a long time for your photos. NT does not support USB, so  investing in a card reader is one solution; another is to drop the  flashcard into the PDA and transfer from the PDA to the PC. Hardly  satisfactory - a shame to let down such a great product this way.","Date":"August 9, 2000"}

I phoned the vendor,  they said their website was incorrect, but they sent me the 20 mb card  anyway.  I do recommend that you purchase a card with more capacity than  the 8 MB that is now standard.  A PCMCIA flashcard interface is nice if  you use a notebook PC that doesn't have a USB port.  An AC adapter is  vital.  I notice that the price is dropping almost daily, so the Bang for  the Buck is improving.  Based upon my experience, this camera is a definite  winner.","Date":"May 15, 2000"}
{"Title":"Good camera, download problems","Author":null,"ReviewID":"REOZN51UNBZDK","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this camera for over 6 months now and I am happy with the pictures that I have taken. One major problem is with downloading into the computer with this; It ususlly takes several tries and many times just hangs up after a few pictures when it does down load. There are usually errors like no pictures in camera when the flashcard is full. The problem seems to be with the \"twain\"transferring pictures,That is the only way. No one can figure what the problem is but it seems to be the software that came with the camera and the Kodak software that is needed no matter what digital imaging software is used. (I tried 6 different types with all the same problems). Out of frustration I bought an HP photosmart 1250 photo printer that I just plug the flashcard into. With that I usually get outstanding results; the pictures look just like I took them with a Nikon SL 35mm camera.If I could only get the computer download to work as well I could not ask for more. For now I do not download unless I have lots of time to Keep trying. Therefore I dont do it very often anymore, I just print them directly with the printer.","Date":"July 24, 2001"}

The resolution and features are truly incredible for a camera in this price range. The software installs easily and has good  help information to guide you through the image editing process.The  camera comes loaded with many nice features. About the only thing lacking  is an optical zoom. I'm a frugal consumer and decided that the added cost  of an optical zoom wasn't justified for my intended use of the camera. Most  features have been covered in other reviews but one nice feature that I  haven't seen mentioned much is the video out jack and cable (included) that  allows you to view your photos on a television. My parents are in their  80's and don't have excellent vision, so the television connector lets me  share photos with them without them having to peer at the tiny LCD  screen.Accessories add a substantial amount to the cost of your camera  outfit. Expect to pay an extra $100 to $250 above and beyond the camera  price for them. I bought a SanDisk SmartMedia 32MB memory card, a DigiPower  Solutions 12X rechargeable power pack, and a SanDisk SmartMedia USB  external drive for downloading onto my PC. The only problem I encountered  was with the Sandisk SmartMedia USB external drive. The install software  had trouble locating a device driver, but I was able to locate the correct  driver at the Sandisk web site and get things working properly. I have not  had any experience with Olympus support, since everything works  great.The bottom line is that this camera offers fantastic value for the  money you spend on it. You really can't go wrong buying this camera. It  rocks!","Date":"April 8, 2000"}
{"Title":"Another Fine Olympus","Author":"Thomas Dukich","ReviewID":"R1XEAE9IVD1FMM","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera because it ranks high in  \"pixels per dollar\" (resolution) and because I own three other Olympus cameras which have been outstanding performers--good picture quality and easy to  use. I spent some time comparing the features of different brands and  models in the $300 to $800 range.  Dollar for dollar this camerea is very  hard (impossible?) to beat.  What you get for twice the price isn't that  much more with the exception of a zoom.  Zooms are a mixed blessing anyway  because so often you get blurry pictures (because you don't use a tripod).  Plus, you usually give up some close-up ability when you have a zoom.  The  zoom might be more important if you don't have some photo editor software  to crop, enlarge, or otherwise manipulate your digital pictures.  Some  minor concerns.  I find the look and feel a little \"clunky\"  compared to other Olympus cameras and other brands.  Also, the new models  are less iMac friendly.  So, I bought an Olumpus SmartMedia Reader which  added to the cost but is a very cool device.  And battery life?  I read all  the comments about getting rechargeable batteries but I was still shocked  at how fast the batteries wear out.  Still, all-in-all, this is a great  camera for the price.","Date":"March 31, 2000"}

I had been reading the customer reviews for several days on  Amazon, and was very much prepared for the short battery life, only 30 good  quality photos with a 8 mb smartmedia card etc. BUT, was i surprised !  Not only does a set of 4 AA batteries (good quality, i.e. Duracell or Sony)  last for the entire 8 MB shoot, but it also allows for a full /  unrestricted use of the flash. To make matters even more impressive, you  can take as much as 122 pictures (standard setup) and the quality of these  photos is amazing. Only if you download these photos and zoom in 2-3 times  into the photo will you feel the 'mosaic', but for ordinary folks like you  and me, we dont need to zoom in that much, and standard photos itself is  extremely good. Furthermore, if you view the photos on TV the clarity is  even more amazing. One thing though ... viewing 'portrait' pictures on TV  is a strain on the neck and the camera does not have any builtin feature  which could switch 'portrait' pictures to 'landscape'.

{"Title":"D360-L vs. D460-Z","Author":"Robert Hastings","ReviewID":"R2UWJZ4FTEQ10L","Overall":"good","Content":"I had occasion to buy the 360 and 460 recently. Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","Date":"June 17, 2000"}

It has thousands of options, great image quality, and, of course, it's digital!  Now you can take all those embarrassing photos of yourself without being afraid of the CVS guy laughing at you.If you lower the image quality you can take 122 pictures on the ultra-small disk provided.  However, the quality is really, really bad (640x480 highly-distorted JPEG).  But on good quality you can take 36, which is enough for one session (you can delete the images from the camera after you download them to your hard drive.)  There's a super-high quality option which makes TIFFs, but I never use it.A few drawbacks:the graphics-editing program that comes with the camera SUCKS.  If you plan to do major photo-editing you should get ahold of Paint Shop Pro (jasc.com) or Adobe Photoshop (adobe.com).  Another problem is that the batteries run out very fast.  It uses four AA batteries every time, which last me about two weeks.  If you want to save on battery life, try not to use the LCD screen and instead take pictures the \"normal\" way.  Also, try not to view the photos on the camera and instead download them to your computer first and view them from the hard drive.Despite these problems, it's the best deal you can find for so little money.  Unless you can afford to spend 800 bucks on something better, this is definitely the way to go.  Anything cheaper probably sucks.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Impressive and Fun.","Author":"Gib","ReviewID":"R3TQMZI0V43DWN","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my first digital camera, although I've used them before. After getting to know it and adding some much needed accessories, I can say it really is a great camera, at a reasonable price. The quality of the pictures is astounding considering it is a relatively basic model. The first thing I would recommend ordering with it is a Sandisk reader. This is cheap and a must have; it downloads all your pictures in an instant and thus saves the clumsy,time,and battery-consuming process of loading them by direct camera-to-computer method. If you've read about the battery life problem you'll be prepared for burying the included batteries on the first day. Others recommend rechargeables, but I've always hated them. They don't last long, and I don't like the hassle. I put in new lithium batteries and they really last. As far as actual picture taking, the only two negatives I see are problems with blurry images of moving subjects and  the lack of a real zoom feature. The zoom feature on this camera merely crops in on your existing image. However I see these  points as minor as the beauty of the picture quality, and sheer fun in using this camera make it a winner. Besides, if you want to zoom in on a shot, just take three or four steps in, and you'll be saving yourself about ... bucks. Out of all the regrettable purchases I've made in my life, I can say this is not one of them. Be careful though, being able to erase and retake shots may lead to severe camera addiction.","Date":"November 22, 2000"}

The most  amazing thing about this camera (compared to both 35's and other digital  cameras I have used) is that it is almost impossible to take anything but a  high res. perfect picture. The macro mode is fun too, and good for online  auctions or any application where a detailed closeup is needed.  I am very  pleased with my purchase.

I also bought the standalone mediacard reader; it installed on my PC like a champ  with absolutely no problems.  Together the two components make for a great  experience!  Even the 8meg card that comes with the camera seems roomy  enough for the kinds of web images that I want to mostly make.  My only  criticism is that there is a considerable delay from when you push the  button until the picture is actually taken -- but I see this same phenomena  with other cameras (both film and digital); it seems to have more to do  with focusing and red-eye reduction than anything else.

The picture quality is much better than I expected it to be, and it is very easy to use.  I was also impressed with the software that comes with the camera and what I was able to do with  pictures after I took them.  Its amazing how good pictures come out in low  light with no flash.  Since it is so much less expensive than the 450 Zoom,  it doesn't have a traditional zoom, it has a digital zoom, which functions  like a traditiional telephoto lens.  So when I want a zoom, I walk closer  to the subject.  The camera lets you take perfect pictures only 4 inches  away from your subject, and that is pretty cool.  My advice:  If you have  $500, get the 450 zoom, if you don't want to spend that much, the D360L is  a great camera and I'm very satisified with it.","Date":"March 21, 2000"}
{"Title":"excellent camera","Author":"Giuseppe A. Paleologo \"gappy\"","ReviewID":"R2JVPIGO9M70AJ","Overall":"good","Content":"The little Olympus is an excellent digital camera for photo amateurs (like me and 99.99% of you). It's rightly considered excellent value for the price, for a number of reasons.Images: the quality of images ranges from  very good to acceptable. The resolution is high enough for album-size  prints, and for web posting. As far as I could tell, the optical group is  good (no distorsions and luminosity gaps).Usability: shooting commands  are very easy, although exposure correction and \"film\"  sensibility can take some time to set up. Nice features are the ability to  shoot sequences and to have wide/spot exposure meter. The \"macro\"  option works fine, but the \"2x\" option is almost worthless to me.  It's better to magnify the section of interest in the editing  phase.Built-in editing: the camera commands are also very easy to use  (you just have to keep the shutter closed). You can view your pictures on a  TV without needing a computer. You can zoom over a picture section. More  important, you can easily store/access/erase pictures, and the quality of  the LCD screen is good (brightness can be adjusted). Downoading images on a  PC/Mac is straightforward too. Overall, it took me less than one hour to  become aquainted with the camera proper.Now with the downsides. The  plastic case has a fragile silver finish which can be scratched too easily.  The camera consumes a lot of power, but life can be extended by keeping the  LCD off, although it is tempting not to. Finally, for a total extra cost of  $50, I would advise you to buy a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a  charger (NOT Olympus: too expensive) and an additional 16Mb+ smartmedia  card (also usable of Rio and other MP3 players).","Date":"June 2, 2000"}

The image quality is astonishing for a product of this price range and the generated files are small, ideal for the web or e-mail. You can apply lots of zoom without pixelation. It's very easy to use. The manual is comprehensive and user-friendly. Buy a  protective case, because the camera doesn't include one and is fragile. You  can carry the SmartMedia cards in it, too. It's worth the money. We have  two of this toys (my father's and mine) and we are very pleased. Don't  forget that Olympus is an excellent brand. The bundled software is fine for  most purposes, but if you want more tweaking on the images, you can use  Corel, PhotoShop, etc. The ideal complement for this camera is a 16 Mb.  SmartMedia card. Don't rush buying it (the memory card) because the prices  are very unstable ... My advice: compare before  you buy. You don't need to buy Olympus-brand memory cards. They are  expensive (Look for other brands like SanDisk), and the only advantage that  they have over the generic cards is the Panorama function (the ability to  take 3 or 4 photos and link them) The camera price is very stable, online  or at a retail store. Consider buying a battery charger, because if you use  the screen too much to take photos, it will drain the batteries quickly.  (Use instead the optical viewer to take photos and the LCD screen to review  them). I have a Kodak charger with NiMH batteries and it works really nice.  Don't use alkaline batteries, because they don't last for long. If you buy  the D360L at some stores, you will be offered with a 4-year full-protection  program. It's worth considering. We are really happy with the camera. One  drawback: The downloading time is long via serial port, specially if you  have a big SmartMedia card with many images. If you are in a rush, buy an  USB adapter. For me, the speed is ok!","Date":"June 12, 2000"}

Very good camera,  with some limitationsPros:  - Excellent images within the 1.3  Megpixel limits  - Very good sensitivity in dark/ shadowed areas -- but  contrast can swamp subtle shadings.  - Easy to use for most settings.  I had it up and taking pictures within about 5 minutes, although figuring  out all the bells& whistles took a while.  Panoramic pictures are very  nice, although you have to be careful in how you compose the set of  pictures to get good splicing in the computer.  - Camedia software is  pretty good, although there are better image processing software available.  - Downloading is easy although somewhat slow with the serial  connection.Cons  - Eats batteries.  Buy some rechargable NiMH  batteries and a charger on your way home from the store.  I keep a set  charged at all times and swap them out every time I take the camera out.  Works great that way.  Very very seldom run out of power when using the  camera.  LCD works very well, but will drain your batteries.  -  Viewfinder does *NOT* show accurate depiction of what the image to be  captured.  Use the LCD for proper image composition (but doesn't work in  direct sunlight), or be willing to crop the pictures on the computer  -  At low light levels is very sensitive to movement and blurring of images  (not unexpected).  - It's not 35 mm resolution;  there are limits on  enlarging pictures before running into pixel limitations.  For point and  shoot though, it's great.  - 2x digital zoom is a feature of very  limited usage. Figure you're buying a camera without zoom, and you won't  come in with adverse expectations.  Almost never used.Tips &  Comments  - We're getting almost 35 mm photo quality outputs from a HP  Inkjet printer (PSC 500) and HP premium photo paper.  The pictures look  good on white bond paper, but the difference with high quality photo paper  is amazing.  - We've only filled the 8 MB card a couple of times and  wished we could download the pictures to take more.  A few minutes editing  using the thumbnail display on the LCD can delete bad pictures and reduce  the number of images on the card to take more pictures.  We do download the  camera every night and clean the images off the card.  - Our breakeven  was an estimated 30 rolls of film -- if we used the camera more than 1000  images we would have found it worth it.  We took 400+ pictures alone on a  cruise to Alaska, and then listened to a friend complain about the $150  developing cost they had from their 35 mm film rolls.  - We had the  policy of not taking \"scenery\" shots with the 35 mm since we  didn't want to waste money taking pictures without a person in the picture.  With the digital camera we just take pictures.  The change in attitude to  taking pictures is striking.  We find the marginal cost per picture is near  zero -- unless you print them out.  That cost is around $0.10-0.25 per 1/4  page picture.Overall  - Very happy with this camera, once we've  learned its foibles.  Its not perfect, but very good.  When we're going out  on a family outing, we now just slip the camera in a pocket and take it  along.  We take 10x as many pictures due to the simplicity of digital  imaging and the quality of this camera.  - We highly recommend it.","Date":"September 6, 2000"}

In testing the camera, I choose the worst  scenario: me facing the sun taking a picture of a person.  The sun was  setting, putting it just of the subjects shoulder.  With the camera set on  automatic, the result was very acceptable. Face was recognizable.  It was  almost \"arty\" because of the suns rays. The next test was in  extremely low light.  The results were great.  A little washed out on close  subjects as you would expect, but overall picture quality was very, very  good.

It's gotta be the most bang for the bucks camera out there.I am a cautious buyer and did lots of research first. (Thanks Amazon) One common complaint was battery life.  If you are going to turn on the LCD monitor and stare at photos every five minutes then it is going to eat batteries. First of all, get an Energizer ACCU rechargable for NiMH AA batteries. Do NOT get NiCads!  If you don't overwork the LCD monitor, batteries are NOT a problem. I took about 40-42 HQ (1280x960)shots on one fully charged set of NiMH's. About fifteen of those were with flash. I took my new toy to London where my charger would not work so I took a bunch AA Alkelines as back up. They are still in the unopened package. I highly recommend the purchase of a FlashPath Floppy Disk Adaptor...  It was shipped the next day. They include an 8mb smartmedia card which is good for another 36 HQ shots. An 8mb card comes with the camera. The only difficulty I had was taking panorama shots in bright sunlight.  It is difficult to see the monitor but would have been better had I turned up the brightness to \"high\". The 360L has lots of nice features that I had not even known about. And, it is so great to take a shot and email it within minutes without the hassle of using up the rest of the roll and running out to have it processed. This is a five star plus camera. Goodbye film and vinyl recordings. Who needs ya? Meybee a museum.","Date":"June 2, 2000"}

As stated in previous articles, the battery life is quite annoying.  One set of normal batteries lasted one shoot/download and then died.  I found that the new energizer batteries made specifically for electronics work wonderfully, providing me with 3 weeks and counting use of the camera. As far as bundled applications, they have a fine organizational and download tool, but their editing tool leaves a lot to be desired.  You might want to get Photoshop LE (unless you have the money to buy the full blown version!). Also, the bundled cable left me a bit less than satisfied as far as download speed goes, so I purchased the Olympus Camedia SmartMedia drive (USB compatible).  It is awesome!  I highly recommend purchasing it if you intend to download a large amount of photos. Overall this is a great camera and I strongly recommend it (with the USB drive) for Mac or PC users.","Date":"October 18, 2000"}

I read a lot of reviews and decided on the Olympus D-360L.  It takes great pictures for Web publishing.  I haven't even used the maximum resolution setting on it yet, as only two photos will fit on the 8MB card, and I compress the photos for the Web anyway.  I don't print pictures from it, since 35mm is so much cheaper, but I'd think 5x7 photos would look great with a good dye sublimation printer.I bought an inexpensive SmartMedia USB reader from Sandisk ($30), so transferring pictures is quick, painless, and doesn't eat batteries.  As far as I know, the USB reader will work on a Mac, but I don't own a Mac.  The only thing I wish is that I would have bought the D-460Z instead, as I really miss a zoom feature.

I also purchased another 8mb  card to give me a total of 72 very high quality pictures, but being able to  review and erase unwanted pictures with the lcd screen, one card might be  enough for most people.","Date":"June 29, 2000"}

The 8MB card is bigger than most cameras offer and holds enough pictures for me, and even if I want more, I can just buy another card.  The quality of picture is great, even at the medium level, and when I order pics from (on-line) they come back looking great.  The menus are easy enough to understand but do all that I need them to do.  The panorama function is the coolest thing about the camera, even though I have yet to use it anywhere other than my office and apartment (when I go to the Grand Canyon it'll come in really handy).  The software is good.  The LCD screen is clear. The picture-taking options are very useful.  Even the battery life is fine (other people have complained)... I bought two sets of NiMH rechargeables with a charger and I always have enough power.  If I have one complaint, it is that it doesn't have a USB connection... the Serial conntection is slow, but as long as you are prepared to wait a bit (go have a sandwich maybe), it is not a big deal.I have already used it for a friend's new baby and the wedding of an old college friend.  The ability to put these pictures on the Internet so that friends and relatives can see them has made me a very popular chap.I have a Canon Rebel 2000 SLR for those times when I need a higher quality picture, so for my point-and-shoot needs the Olympus D-360L is perfect.","Date":"December 19, 2000"}

This camera is great for the everyday use. If you are a casual picture taker like myself (Family functions, kids etc.), then this camera is for you. It feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic one like some other Digital camera's feel (FUJI 1300). It comes with a 8MB smartmedia card with can take 36 High Quality pictures (which look great) it can take about 18 Super High Quality (breath taking), and about 60+ regular quality (eh...so so). Smartmedia is very cheap ($80 for about 32MB card).You can directly connect to your TV via the provide NTSC cable to view your pictures on your TV.There is only 2 drawbacks. It sucks batteries (if you use the LCD screen alot). I have taken about 200 pictures on a set of batteries and still going. The other drawback is the cable to transfer the images to your computer. It is a RS232 Serial cable. It takes about 10 mins. to transfer about 36 pictures. But you can always get the Viking tranfer system to cut that down.I am not a photographer but I feel this camera is great bargain for someone that isn't looking to be the next National Geographic photographer!","Date":"December 28, 2000"}

{"Title":"TERRIFIC PRODUCT - NO regrets","Author":"Suzanne","ReviewID":"R1EOV909LKETG2","Overall":"good","Content":"WONDERFUL product. Selection of this camera was not arbitrary - I spent a LOT of time researching and reading reviews of different cameras before deciding on this one.  I think my satisfaction was GREATLY increased by  purchase of 2 additional things: a card reader (I bought a Lexar USB ...  USB is worth the extra cost) and a 16MB card). I've never used the cable to  upload photos.  The reader uploads to computer are a no-brainer snap, you  can even move the photos via Windows Explorer if you don't want to use the  software that comes with the camera.  Battery time is very good based on  recent experience.  I was in Belgium for a week and never had to change  batteries.  Bear in mind that's by using the card reader for uploads and  without using the AC adapter! Good manual comes with the camera. I'm still  learning the icons on the readout, but that's a very minor thing for me.  I  use the camera for website photos and for insertion into PowerPoint  presentations.  It's superb for both.  I have no regrets and am  exceptionally pleased with the product.  It's a wonderful product for the  price. If you're on a tight budget, don't get the AC adapter until you see  if you really need it, but the card reader is really worth the money  (particularly after reading reviews by those who use the cable transfer).","Date":"July 9, 2000"}

The pictures  are of great quality & the features are very useful. Multiple settings  for ISO, flash, spot are great, and if you rather point & shoot it does  a great job there too! Extras such as the autofiring action mode (takes  rapid shots, one every half a second for up to 10 secs) are good for casual  fun as well. The software suits its purpose. I agree the battery life is  not the best, but all digicams will drain AA's very quickly, I invested in  Ni-metal rechargeables and seem to be doing fine with those. So far I've  been using the serial port download, it's fairly slow, but I can live  instead of shelling out for a USB adaptor. 8MB can fit lots of standard  quality, but I really preferred the super-high quality shots where you'll  only be able to squeeze 18 shots onto the 8 MB smart media.","Date":"March 30, 2000"}

{"Title":"Good pictures, Good size, Great memory, Battery hog!","Author":"J \"tech head dc\"","ReviewID":"RBAGJL4Y6GRG5","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, buy several rechargeable batteries when you get this camera! As  soon as I got mine, we played around with it off-n-on for no more than 3 or  4 hours before the brand-new alkaline batteries were useless. Flashes and  the built-in monitor really suck 'em dry.Now, besides that, the Olympus  D-360L is my first digital camera. Now I'm not really great at taking  pictures, so I put most of the settings on \"auto\" and hope that I  can Photoshop them into looking better later on. The picture quality is  good overall, but if you want any sort of details captured, you'll have to  use the largest pixel size available, and zoom in, too. So forget about  trying to get those great concert shots from 25 rows back. Most of my work  is on the internet, so it's great for web publishing, but I doubt that  these pics would look that great if they were printed out -- but I haven't  really tried yet, either.The compact design is quite good, so I can't  believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week. I  know I've carried mine around in my rough-n-tumble book bag for weeks on  end, and it hardly has a scratch on it. If you want to change the camera's  settings, there's a lot of button pushing to change the shutter,  white-balance, and image file size options. My friends have gotten quite  tired of posing and waiting for me to switch around to larger sizes, or to  zoom in, or to take the picture over again because I flashed when I didn't  want to. And there's a slight delay between when I've pushed the button and  when the camera takes the pic. \"Capturing the moment\" often takes  a couple mintues to prepare. Also, the pictures I've taken often look  fantastic on the LCD monitor, but are fuzzy when I download  them.Downloading is a snap ... sort of. Just install the software once,  then hook the cable up to your serial port and ... wait. It takes several  minutes to download multiple pictures. Heck, it even takes a while just to  view all the thumbnails in the editor. The editing software included is  okay, but it's no Photoshop.The very first weekend I had it, I went to a  crazy drunken club party and took lots of pictures of people dancing around  in an altered haze. Surprisingly, most of the photos came out great -- very  fun and colorful -- except when the flash goes off, people often have red  eye (which is fixable through adjustments) or if they are close to the  camera the flash washed them out like white ghosts. And if I didn't use the  flash, then they came out smeared because the shutter was open too long  since it was compensating for the missing light. It definitely takes some  learned skill to get great shots on the fly.In comparison, though, for  the price you pay here, you are getting a really good deal with this handy  little device. The low-light photos are a bit grainy but quite bright  considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but  black. I haven't yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it  looks darkly lit on purpose; it always seems to automatically compensate.  Also, the multi-photo \"panoramic\" option and the \"action  sequence\" modes are fun to play with, but not necessarily going to be  useful to me in the long run. On one 8mb card, you can fit about 16 big  files, but tons of little photos. And remember, rechargeables,  rechargeables, rechargeables!","Date":"September 7, 2000"}

Literally right out of the box we were both taking great shots indoors and out. The quality is great for our amateur needs, and some of the shots even look professional to our untrained eyes. We have yet to read the manual for tips, no doubt the pix will be even better then. My only complaint is that Olympus and all resellers that I'm aware of advertise the camera as platform-independent. However, an 'optional' cable adaptor is required for Mac connecting, and even then only to an older (non- G4, G3, or iMac) Mac's serial port. If it doesn't plug and play for both PCs and Macs, it's not platform-independent. ...","Date":"May 6, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great entry-level digital camera, but room for improvement!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2RXNXKN7UMLPB","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this camera as a gift for a friend, and it's great for taking casual, everyday pictures.  It's versatile and easy to use, with fairly good picture quality.  Initially I thought the 8MB SmartMedia card was a  bit on the small side, but it's a fair amount of storage space.  But since  I'm used to 35mm, I think there are a few shortcomings:  First, the CCD is  weak in the blue channel.  This means that reds and greens are accurately  recorded but there's a lot of graininess/noise in the blues.  This is a  common problem in all CCD-based devices, including scanners, and when  determining imaging quality, the blue channel is very revealing.  Under  most circumstances, though, you get an acceptable image.  Second, the user  interface is a little clumsy; you have to close the cover to review images.  The buttons do different things in different modes, and sometimes it's  hard to remember which is which.  Finally, I think it should've come with a  USB cable as well as a 9-pin serial.  (The HP line of cameras include a USB  cable for faster upload.)  But for the price, this is an excellent camera,  especially for people who don't require studio-quality images.","Date":"June 27, 2000"}

{"Title":"There is no better camera at the price!","Author":"Baltic Books \"Vic\"","ReviewID":"ROXCPU9ZQ5PKQ","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading every review we could find, we ventured for the first time  into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital  camera last year. We were definitely not disappointed.The D-360L was  the next step up from the D-340R. Then and today you cannot find a better  quality camera at this price, outside of the Olympus family.  The 360 has  all the same features of the 340-R, but adds capabilities to adjust white  balance, and tinker with spot metering, ISO and exposure settings.  It also  adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen, as well as  multiple flash and file compression settings.If you want additional zoom  power you'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $100 more.  It  adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview  screen.  If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try  looking for a D-340R.  They are still around at onine shops andit is a  great camera on the cheap!  All three of the camera have the same lens,  megapixel size etc.Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days  owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and  Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home. The camera  performed marvelously. We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more  than adequate for our needs, as we easily downloaded photos each day into  our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? The 360 will  use up to a 32MB smart media card, enough for 400+ shots at low resolution.","Date":"September 5, 2000"}

I do suggest that you get rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter because the battery life isn't very long, especially if you're turning on the LCD screen a lot.  The camera itself is easy to use and the manual that comes with it is helpful.  I like the size and the design, but I do wish it came with a carrying case.

I thought the picture quality is very nice. But one important function is missing: after I download the photo images to my  PC using the CAMEDIA Master 1.2 software, I found that the date can not be  imprinted automatically on the right down corner of each picture. I read  carefully the camera manual and the software help documents, but no any  answer there, so I called the Olympus tech support hot line (1-8885534448).  the person there told me both the camera and the software can not  automatically add the date on a picture,  but if I buy a speicific Olympus  printer for printing, the date can be there,  or I can manually insert a  text box on each picture, I tried but the effect is bad because  the date  font is not quartz font so it does not like a phote picture. if any body  knows how to solve this problem, pls let us know.

I have taken thousands of pictures EACH WEEK with this camera and it is a true workhorse. It is my personal camera as well. So I tend to hook-up and unhook-up this camera daily - and I've experienced zero problems.I download pictures at a high speed using a ZIO card reader and it's always flawless. I use an iMac at home and a normal PC at work - and it works great with both. I use a 64mb Viking Components SmartMedia card and it can hold 292 high quality, under 350k pictures. We actually have a different company's 5.0 mp camera at work - and it is imposible to learn and use. We gave up. But you can learn this camera in under a minute and you'll be taking great pictures instantly. We're on eBay under the seller name bookman21century - see for yourself.This camera has been dropped numerous times, kicked around, loaded and unloaded daily - it has literally gone through the fires of Mt. Doom - and yet is still performs brilliantly. Sure the battery life is poor, but we use a power cord at work at that works great. And sure these newer cameras have many more mega-pixels - but this camera at 1.3 has worked so fine that it's all we need, or will need, for our home and business. So, I'd recommend this for any high-volume auction user. You open the shutter, aim, and press the button. I will always, always, always stick to Olympus for its ease of use, its durable quality, its toughness, and its adaptability. If you are taking 10,000 or 100,000 pictures - this workhorse is more than up to the task!","Date":"November 15, 2003"}

It's  almost impossible to take a bad photo with it, and it's great not having to  wait for a photo-processing lab before seeing the photos.I'm an American  currently living and working in London, England. I bought an Olympus  Camedia D-360L before I left home, and I've been sending photos of my  adventures along with a daily email newsletter to my friends, family, and  co-workers back at the US office.Nearly everyone has commented on the  clarity and sharpness of the photo attachments, and at work, the number of  subscribers to my Daily UK Newsletter list has swelled.I just love this  camera!!!! It's small enough to slip in a jacket pocket and take  sightseeing, and the photo editing software features help turn even  mediocre shots into good photos.My only criticism is that the included  Camedia photo-editing software is pretty unstable on Windows 98. I'm  running a laptop with 96 MB of memory, and find that the Camedia program  crashes frequently while using the Rotate and Filter->Brightness  features, leaving an alert dialog that won't go away unless I reboot.","Date":"August 8, 2000"}

First, it eat batteries, forcing you to ...rechargeable bateries and a adapter for use when downloading images. 2nd, the camera has no optical zoom, forcing you to use the digital (and the LCD screen which drains batteries.) My third gripe about the camera is that the button for the LCD screen is resecced so it won't get turned on accidentaly, but the button makes it very, very, very dificult to turn on. I reapeatadly find my self stuggling to turn on the LCD screen. My 4th and final gripe is that it has no USB connection with the package.

I have even received reasonable battery life by using the view finder exclusively.  A major problem was downloading via the serial port on my PC.  I have the Palm V software on board and the Palm V synchronization software kicks in whenever the PC is turned on.  This in turn made it impossible for the computer to find the camera and download pictures. The solution was very simple but was not to be found in any printed matter available from Olympus or Palm.

Looking through the stores I was dismayed at how high prices for a decent digital camera were, but then I found this one online and WOW, was it worth the price.

If you buy a 32 MB  cartridge to go along with it (as did I), then you can hold a whopping 180  pics total - plus the ability to delete the ones you don't want as you go  means those 180 last even longer.

After much research through the internet,  newspaper and magazines, I found only the Olympus D-360L meets the  \"ease of use\" criteria.  First, the camera itself is small enough  to fit into one's pocketbook or a small bag making it easy to carry.  Second, the many picture-quality settings are good for amateur  photographers looking for the perfect shot or the more skilled photographer  with specific shots in mind.  Third, the LCD Monitor is useful not only for  taking wide panorama shots, but serves as a viewer to delete unwanted  pictures.  Lastly, uploading pictures into the Camedia software is simple.  Just plug the 9-prong cable from the back of the PC into the camera, turn  the camera on and click on the my camera icon in the software and voila!  the pictures are ready to view.  The software also lets you size, enhance  and remove red-eye from photos.  When you are through adjusting your  photos, you can save them to your favorite file or print them.  With the  push of a button through the software or the camera itself, the original  picture can be discarded.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone.

I immediately purchased a 16 MB smart media card and 4xAA NiMH w/ charger.  Downloading pix via the RS232 cable averaged about 30 s each -- painfully slow for a full memory card.  An internal card reader helped out a great deal when I upgraded to a new PC.Image quality is good but not great, as I always have to tweak colors with PhotoShop.  You can squeeze out decent 5x7's from the pix if you set up your shots right (can't crop them or you'll lose too much resolution); 4x6's are no problem.There's a bit of a learning curve to the menu, but since it's digital photography, you can practice lots and delete what you don't want.  I use mine constantly, and I even try to fill up both of my memory cards whenever I'm at a family gathering or camping or whatever holiday.Finally, I take all my pix at the highest JPG setting and ignore the lower resolutions; sort of a waste of time to get 1000 pix if you don't have any detail.","Date":"December 9, 2004"}

Forget about memory card readers,scaners and printers that use the usb cables.  For use with a comptor and a good photo formate, buy a Olympus Digital...","Date":"February 23, 2002"}
{"Title":"A review from a Macintosh user","Author":"Shelley Gammon \"Geek\"","ReviewID":"R1TTEOU4GBATAI","Overall":"bad","Content":"Our IT vendor ordered this for  me 3 years ago (yes, the camera has been out that long... makes you think, doesn't it) when I told him I didn't know anything, but I needed a digital camera in a hurry.Having been new to the world of digital cameras at the time, I was easily impressed when I opened the package. They advertise the camera as being Mac compatible via a serial port.Well, Macs haven't shipped with serial ports for YEARS. Why not USB?!I had to buy a [price] adapter by Belkin (about the only one in existance that would connect this camera to my G3 at the time). The images download SLOOOOOOOW via a serial port. USB is a much faster architecture. Of course, firewire is 100 times faster than USB, but since Windows hasn't caught up to the technical advances of Mac yet, USB would have been sufficient for a cross-platform market.When you're using Olympus's proprietary software to download the images from your camera, you can't do anything else... it does not function in the background. Very sloppy programming... no need for such a simple process to take up so much of the system heap.The camera uses 4 (four) AA batteries, which add to the weight of the camera significantly. If you use the LED screen in the back of the camera, prepare to carry an additional 12 AA batteries with you for a day-long shoot, because you're going to be changing batteries at least 3 times in order to shoot a single day on a vacation... this camera eats batteries for breakfast.This also  applies if you use the flash. There is very little warning that the batteries are low... when there is almost no juice left, a pitiful battery icon will flash briefly in the view finder and then that's it.  This camera does not use rechargable batteries....About 8 months after owning this camera, I started noticing a delay in response time. I'd click on the shutter release and a full second and a half would pass before the picture would be taken. This is too much of a delay! The picture should take immediately... just like it does on a 1955 Brownie Hawkeye. If I'm trying to shoot an action shot or an animal or a child, every split second matters... when I click, the picture should be taken immediately, not a week later. Fresh batteries don't make a difference in the delay.The camera does take some half-way decent 640x480 JPEG shots, but the camera is slow in writing them to disk, which means you can't take the photos quickly in succession.  You also can't delete a bad shot on the camera, so even if a shot is awful, you're stuck with it until you load the disk into the computer to delete the shot... which means you have to wait for the ENTIRE roll of shots to load into the program and download in order to even delete them.There are some great bargains to be had in the computer world.... This is not the case with digital cameras. You truly get what you pay for. After being exposed to some very nice digital still cameras and digital camcorders, I can confidently say that this little Olympus is one of the worst I've ever used, and should definitely be a last choice for anyone using a Macintosh.","Date":"January 24, 2002"}

{"Title":"Very good starter Digital camera","Author":"Darrell","ReviewID":"R1CQUE5W3WEWRC","Overall":"good","Content":"The was my first digital camera and I've owned it for 3 years now.  It takes suprisingly good pictures.  It helps to understand the weaknesses of digital photography when using any digital camera.  Digital cameras will not give great rendition in low light situations.  In fact low light settings are often best handled without using the flash to avoid adding contrast to the photo.  I've seen a number of reviews where users complained about low lighting performance using the flash.  This may indicate a lack of digital camera experience.  The average in camera flash is only good within 8 feet.  This is very critical with digitals because shadow areas are digitals weak point.  Other than that caution you'll find this camera allows you to easily take great pictures.  I've often been surprised at how good the photos come out, even with this small number of pixels.  I've printed all types of photos from this camera up to 8x10 (not a recommended size).  It easily produces very good 3x5, 4x6 and 5x7 prints.  Pricing has come down on higher pixel cameras recently so this camera's price is not as attractive as it once was. ...","Date":"January 24, 2003"}

I have been able to get GOOD images of everything from Christmas lights at night to extreme close-ups of flower blossoms.  I have one picture of a flower 3/4\" across that fills the frame!  It will do a fair, but not GREAT, job of stop-motion, as well...good enough to get cats playing.  The flash is extremely adjustable, and recycles reasonably quickly (less than 2 secs.).  As others have said, though, it does eat batteries!  A charger, and two sets of metal hydride rechargeable batteries, are well worth the investment, as one set of them will last about 100 pics worth.  I dearly love having this camera available, and highly recommend it as an everyday digital camera for everyone except the serious or professional photographer.","Date":"December 27, 2001"}

{"Title":"The Olympus D-360L is a Direct Hit! Excellent!","Author":"Terrance Shaw","ReviewID":"R3DNYXPLLTE8Q1","Overall":"good","Content":"Alright, I've got to say... this is perhaps the best camera that I've ever owned. A major step up from my first digital camera (a Mustek VDC-3500-which I'd highly recommend against), and even better than my Sony DCR-TRV130 Digital8 Camcorder (which isn't focused on taking photographs anyway), the Olympus D-360L is a dream come true. From the 1.8\" LCD screen to the sixty-four (64) megabyte (no, that's not a typo; the D-360L that I bought came packaged with a 64Mb SmartMedia chip in addition to the 8Mb chip packaged originally with the camera ... The photo quality of images taken with the camera is hardly anything to scoff at, and if you've got advanced image-editing software (i.e., Adobe Photoshop), then you can make an excellent image look even better!The only downside that I've managed to find to the camera, is the same problem that countless others have pointed out: the low battery life. But, as people have recommended, this problem can be overcome with nothing more than either a large pack of AA batteries, or just by buying a dozen or so rechargeable batteries and switching out between them. There are additional quirks that I've got against the camera, but nothing that can't be overcome by spending a couple dollars or so. First, it's the fact that the D-360L camera uses a serial connection for uploading images to your computer. This means that you're in for somewhat of a wait, unless you buy a SmartMedia memory reader. But no worries! You can buy an extremely affordable SmartMedia reader ...for [very little]! ... When I plugged the SmartMedia reader into my computer, it immediately picked up on what it was, and installed the drivers automatically, without any necessary disc (although a drivers disc does come with the reader), as I'm running the Windows 2000 Professional operating system. But what I found to be the most interesting thing about the reader is this: it doesn't transfer the images through a TWAIN interface, but instead, shows up as a drive in My Computer, where you can just copy, paste, and delete the file(s) right there! Now isn't that convenient?As a matter of fact, if you're a Mac user, I'd really recommend that you purchase a SmartMedia reader, because it's only an added twenty dollars, and the investment is well worth it in the long run. ... In addition to rechargeable batteries and the SmartMedia reader though, I'd recommend that you also purchase an AC adapter for the camera to save battery-life while you're transferring the images (this is of course, unnecessary if you purchase a SmartMedia reader).All in all, I'd say that the Olympus D-360L digital camera was the best [money] that I've ever spent on a computer-related gadget, and I know that, if you can see past it's few (small) flaws, you'll really love this, as it's a great product, entrance level or not. My final verdict is five out of five for the camera, and I'd encourage EVERYONE to buy one of these.Here's a bit of an update (August 04, 2002).  Recently, I went on vacation with my dad to Philadelphia.  Well, I went to visit Hershey Park to check out the Dolphin show, starring Clovis and Wee Tee.  The show was excellent, albeit rather short?weighing in at fifteen minutes, plus fifteen minutes of sea lions.  In any event, I took a LOT of pictures while I was there, and I began to notice that the camera was a bit slow with taking the pictures.  It took around perhaps two to three seconds to process each image in high-quality mode.  Although it might not seem like a lot of time in between pictures, it's an aeon, when your subjects are fast-paced Dolphins!  However, even though there is this little problem that I have with it, my review still holds at five stars.","Date":"June 25, 2002"}

Finally, I gave in, and how glad I am that I did. It has been a real winner in terms of ease of use and quality of pictures. Many look like a professional photographer took and developed them. For those who want great pictures and ease of use at a really bargain price, this is the camera for you. Most of us don't want pictures larger then 5 X 7, so why pay for more megapixels that you don't need? I also bought a 64 and a 128MB SmartCard, and have more than enough storage for vacations.

This camera gives a vertical green line in almost every picture which is very disturbing. I called up Olympus and asked for an exchange, but they refused to do that. Instead they said the green lines are because the batteries are left in the camera itself. They suggested to remove the batteries if camera is not in use.

{"Title":"Amazing camera for \"the price\", but some probs for Mac users","Author":"David W. Griffin","ReviewID":"R10MM8G7J8RIP3","Overall":"good","Content":"For image quality, I was quite amazed by the quality of the pictures produced by this camera. At high quality (JPEG) you can get 36 pictures on the 8MB card, and presumably, with  the 64MB card ... ... that wouldbe  288 pictures! With the LCD off, the battery usage isn't too badeither. I also find that the closeup pictures (the macro mode) is also quite good, though the flash is overpowering in these situations. I'll probably experiment with a flash diffuser, possibly something as simple as a piece of white paper over the flash in these cases.For Macs though, be prepared to work through a few problems. First of all, the cable that converts the PC serial connector to the Macintosh serial connector (for older macs like mine) isn't in the box, despite the label on the box which indicates that it's mac compatible. There's a coupon you can mail to get this connector free, but it should be in the box in my opinion. For modern macs, one would probably have to buy a USB smartmedia card reader.Knowing this however, I also bought the SanDisk FlashDisk  adapter that allows you to read smartmedia cards from your floppy disk drive (also gone in modern Macintosh computers). It too claimed to be mac compatible but it too lacked any actual support in the box. There was NO software for the mac. I had to download the drivers from the internet.Then I found the drivers claimed that OS8.6 was necessary (I was running OS 8.5.1). I was able to read single image files off the flashdisk, but not two or more. I installed 8.6 but found I had the same problem. I was subsequently able to download multiple files when I directed them to a subdirectory instead of the desktop. I can't say for sure that this alone was the cause of the problem, but at least the whole combination worked.8x10's are somewhat unsatisfying (of course) but 4x5's made with the camera are really good. It would probably make passable 5x7's. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Olympus lost a star for a somewhat complex user interface and no mac cable in the box.","Date":"February 19, 2001"}

The 1280x960  resoultion is more than adequate assuming you are not planning to enlarge  small portions of the picture. Using the LCD display tends to drain the  batteries rather quickly, but the money I save on film and developing  pictures easily makes up for this. Also, don't expect to be able to use  this camera without reading the instructions. In my opinion, the D-360L is  probably the best under-$300 digital camera on the market.","Date":"June 12, 2000"}
{"Title":"Affordable and reliable plus quality and features.","Author":"Paul Webb","ReviewID":"R112POYNP489L4","Overall":"good","Content":"EXCELLENT!  I bought this camera largely based on the reviews that i saw here in Amazon.com. I have to say that the 5-star reviews this camera has been receiving are right on the money. This camera has everything the  normal every day user would need as well as features that the advanced user  would appreciate. Picture quality is generally very good. The 5 different  picture quality settings give you the ability to use this camera for a  variety of uses (home, office, web etc). There are so many options such as  panoramic pictures, zoom/macro, ISO settings, slow shutter speeds for  night/low light conditions etc.. And the 1.3 Megapixel resolution is  excellent for this range of 'entry level' digital cameras. This camera is  also very good for night use as it seems to be able to handle a variety of  lighting levels quite well.  When you consider the price it really is a  VERY good buy. Once again i say EXCELLENT!","Date":"April 1, 2000"}

I was a camera snob. Then had kids  and couldn't be bothered to lug around an SLR plus attachments. With the  excuse that I was buying it for my wife, I purchased one of the original  Olympus clamshell designs in 1992. Secretly I loved this little camera. Not  long after I sold the cherished Nikon. So it goes.But after 8 years, the  trusty Olympus was showing it's age. And the kids responsible for my buying  it in the first place had dropped it one too many times. So I was in search  of its replacement.I'm comfortable with computers and digital technology  and felt it was time to look at a digital camera.I was intrigued  sufficiently to visit Wolf Camera and look at one.If a picture is worth  a thousand words, experiencing something must be worth at least  10,000.Unlike its 35mm cousins (Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom 80 QD CG Camera  comes to mind and is what I wound up buying) this camera seems to have been  designed and built by a completely different company.It is large; won't  fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.It is heavy.It is square and  boxlike (none of the Stylus Epic's sensuous lines).If you are attracted  to one-shot cameras and specifically to Olympus for their small size and  ergonometric elegance be sure to actually hold one of these before ordering  over the web.","Date":"July 26, 2000"}

Then they don't send it.  When you call, they act as if you are the only Mac user on the planet and can't understand what you want.  Finally, you give in to buying one of their Reader-Writers.  Weeks later you receive it and then try to use it.  It doesn't work and your Mac continually freezes and has to be restarted. You still can't down-load your pics.Customer service from Olympus is a joke. A major joke. When after a half hour you get through the system, they don't know the product and continually misunderstand what they're telling you.  Don't waste your time trying to get any substantial help.  This camera is not for Mac owners.This camera was a gift from my daughter. I'm sad that she wasted the money.  I keep it because I can download it on to a friend's PC. But frankly without a zoom, the pictures are very ordinary and the camera operation is counter-intuitive (at least to Americans).

I  will say that for the six months I had it some of the picutures I have are  O.K. for what the camera is.  Ok enough mild mannered praise, let the  bashing begin!This cameras LCD display never did work right from day  one, it would do what it wanted, working some days and some days not.  The  lack of USB interface is so outdated and slow its just a shame.  Never  could take more than ten picutres with it before the batteries would die.  The LCD display, when it did work was nearly imposible for the novice user  to understand.

My criteria were picture quality, advanced features and a price under $500. After a week of  taking over a hundred pictures, I'm very impressed with both the crisp  quality and true to life colors of each picture. It automatically adjusts  to florescent, incandescent, and outdoor light. The selectable ISO settings  makes for very impressive low light pictures. The panorama stitching was  easy to use and very accurate. This will be great for taking seascapes  while on vacation. I'm still on my first set of batteries so battery life  is great. I read a lot of reviews on the D450 ZOOM before I purchased the  D460 and all the small things that owners complained about were fixed.  Olympus really must listen to customer feedback. The menus are easy to use,  it remembers settings when turned off, they even ship three manuals in each  language instead of one in three languages. I recommend picking up a USB  port SmartReader or Floppy adapter. Also get some NiMH batteries and a  charger. You're in for some great pictures with this camera.","Date":"April 18, 2000"}
{"Title":"Low price for the high quality, let me give a quality review","Author":"James E. Dimitroff","ReviewID":"R1993SG822IGIH","Overall":"good","Content":"I have been using this camera for about a month now.  I did extensive research on the internet for digital cameras $500 and under. The runners where Olympus 360L, Kodak 210, and Olympus D460Z.  And it is a very impressive camera overall.  The camera itself offers wide angle or zoom 3x shots.  It also offers a 3x cropping to bring it to 6x.  It's menu is very easy to use out of the box.  Has 2 menu modes, one with camera active, one when it's not active (setup mode.) It's auto focus is by holding the button halfway down for a sec, then clicking.  It's wide/zoom is a small lever next to shutter button for easy access.  You can use it's LCD or to save on batteries it's normal view frame for taking shots.  The smartmedia card and batteries easily installs/uninstalls.  If offers what they call a Paranormal mode which takes multiple pictures on one frame.  It offers a sequence mode that lets you take 10 pictures back to back with for a series shot.  You will need to format your SmartMedia card if it's not from Olympus, but it's fast and easy to do.  My only gripes are when closing the lens cover, you have to be careful and let the lens retrack first, so you just close it a little, then the rest of the way after lens is back in.  The flash flips up, and seems a little clumsey there, but it works fine.  You will need to purchase more than just this camera when you buy it.  What it comes with is: 2 lithium batteries, a hand strape, an 8meg smart media card.  And what else you need would be: a carrying case (est $30), a bigger smart media card (I got a 64meg est $60), NiMH Batteries w/charger(they aren't cheap but worth it est $110), a smart media reader (est $40), and maybe the power adaptor (est $60).  With a 64meg card I get 36 shots in sqhq mode.  And with my NiMH batteries, after one month of use, I still haven't had to replace them.  Normal alkline recharables last maybe 30-40 shots, the NiMH last more like 300-400 shots.  I use the lithium that came with it for backup batteries and place them in my case with 8meg memory card.  A SmartMedia reader is a must for getting the pictures to your computer.  Otherwise you will have to use the serial connection to the camera and very slowly d/l the pics.  Which means you'd have to have a power adaptor because it would drain your batteries.  With a media reader, it's like using a zip drive, and see the MediaSmart card as another drive, and you just drag and drop your pics to your drive, fast, simple, and very slick.  If you choose to purchase this camera, you will be more than pleased that you did.  But be aware, you will need to make a few more purchases in accessories to truely enjoy this camera.","Date":"September 29, 2000"}
{"Title":"The digital camera that made me take the plunge - finally","Author":"Larry J. Clark","ReviewID":"R3CGYYGL6BFLE0","Overall":"good","Content":"I'm primarily a 35mm and subminiature photographer and was waiting until digital resolution and price met at a nice point.  The D-460 did it for  me.First, a couple of warnings: 1) Batteries - Although Amazon lists 4  AA alkalines as the power source, don't count on it.  The two included  Olympus lithium batteries (which are each the same size as a pair of AAs)  are a special high output chemistry.  You will be VERY unhappy if you take  the camera to an event and only have one set of alkalines.  Digital cameras  use a lot of juice, especially when you download and when you use the LCD  screen.  The consumer problem is that the Olympus batteries (CR-V3, or p/n  LB-01E) are VERY hard to find.  I've not seen any in camera or electronics  stores, although you can purchase them for $14 ea directly from Olympus --  and Olympus says you should be able to buy them from several internet  vendors, but the only one on their list that even showed the batteries was  B&H, and they didn't have any in stock (@ $10 ea.).  The next best  thing is use rechageable NiMh cells.  You can spend a hunk of money and buy  the Olympus cell/recharger set, or can hunt around electronics stores and  buy something for about half the price -- make sure you get AA cells in the  1400 to 1500 mAh range. 2)  Price - The normal street price for this camera  is now $399. 3)  Downloading Photos - Although you can use the included  serial cable, you'll also use a lot more batteries.  If you have a USB port  on your computer, you should consider getting getting a SmartMedia external  drive.  They're inexpensive and fast and easy to use.But to the good  stuff.  Side-by-side tests against my office's Sony Mavica's give the  Olympus the edge at the same 640 x 480 resolution.  When you go to the  higher 1280 x 960 resolution, I think you'll be pleased with the results.  The optical finder makes it much easier to take snapshots, especially in  bright sunlight, where LCD only cameras leave you wondering what you're  shooting at.  The 3:1 zoom ratio is comfortable, and you can do accurate  closeups using the LCD screen for a viewfinder.  If you go ahead and buy  the SmartMedia external drive, you should consider getting an additional  8MB (one comes with the camera) or 16MB card.I think that for many  applications, including some professional use, you will find this to be a  good performing camera at a good price.  (The only reason I gave it a  4-star rating is because of the so-so availability of the lithium  batteries, and the fact that it took a little more digging than expected to  figure out what was really going on with those things.)","Date":"August 6, 2000"}

{"Title":"A Definite Winner-- BUY this camera!","Author":"Baltic Books \"Vic\"","ReviewID":"R21E3C7NTV7B0J","Overall":"good","Content":"After reading every review we could find, last year we ventured for the  first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R  digital camera. We were definitely not disappointed.  The D460 is this  year's model improving the 340-R by adding a 3x optical zoom in addition to  the 2x digital zoom. For the price you will not match the features and  quality of this camera.After just a few days the camera accompanied us  to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and Seoul, S. Korea, while we nervously left our  Canon SLR at home. The camera performed marvelously. We found the optional  16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs, as we easily  downloaded photos each day into our laptop. An 8MB card comes  standard.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light  settings. We took shots at our conference including a multimedia  presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was  readable! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian  \"ger\" (tent), we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky--  even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable!Arriving home we were  completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting  when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper. I  doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the  prints and a standard developed snapshot. The enclosed Olympus and Adobe  software is easy to use and functional for most home use. You will  absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and  panorama shots!One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating  was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one. If you  frame... say, a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder, you will  discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area. Olympus should  do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that,  you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries-- shop  around for the best price. Also, picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for  the flash memory card will be a big time saver. You simply pull out the  flash memory card, slip it into the adapter, and then slide the floppy into  any computer. You'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all  around your table, plus a significant download time.One last item-- Do  you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs? You can  purchase up to a 32MB smart media card which will give you more than 400  shots at 800x600!","Date":"September 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"The Olympus 460 is a good point and shoot camera.","Author":"podavis","ReviewID":"R30DOK9RY5YBXC","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the 460 because I wanted a digital camera that I could stick in my pocket but one that I could also expect to take respectable pictures.  On the first count, with the built in lense shield, the camera is easy to  'bring along'.My expectations have been generally exceeded on the second  count. The camera was purchased in time to document a fantastic mixture of  daffodils at their peak.  The camera's macro mode produces stunning  pictures, the detail and contrast of a bloom that fills the frame is  beautiful.  My guess was and is that the apparent price premium for this  camera goes towards premium optics that only a company like Olympus knows  how to engineer.Color rendition is equally impressive, only flesh tones  under flash seem to be a bit off, and fortunately in the warm direction.  Otherwise, my expectations have been exceeded, it's comparable to 35mm  negative film. And I haven't noticed any significant distortions  either.My comparison shopping indicated that the flashes of all cameras  in this range have a 13 foot range.  I was hoping that the capability to  quadruple the effective ISO to 500 would extend the usable range to 26  feet.  So far, after 250 pictures, I have found the noise in a picture  taken at ISO 500 renders low quality pictures.  I haven't experimented much  with ISO 250.The camera seems to be slow to focus, or I'm too impatient,  one must wait for the green light in the view finder to confirm focus has  been found or fuzzy pictures result.  But this is no SLR, it's a point and  shoot concept and one that, given good lighting, takes fantastic pictures.  I printed a still life on a Textronix Phaser wax printer at 8x10 and was  amazed that I got a frameable picture. I didn't expect this it at only  1.3Meg pixels!By the way, it runs just fine on AA NiMH batteries from  Target or Radio Shack.","Date":"May 12, 2000"}

I use it to take promo pictures of bands,  so the location can be a bit hostile (bars and nightclubs) and I wanted  something that I felt was at least somewhat protected.I was more than  thrilled when I uploaded my pictures to a site to have 35mm quality prints  made and found that I could get exceptional 8x10 pics from just the middle  setting of the quality choices. But even in the lowest setting the pictures  are great for website postings.I bought a 16mg card to go with it and I  got 3 complete shows worth of pictures and with the Flashpath adapter, the  websites are getting updated faster than ever.I also bought 2 sets of  rechargeable batteries and have found that I can get a whole weekend of  shows (12-15 hours)on them even using the LCD panel and it's still cheaper  than buying disposable.","Date":"May 31, 2000"}

I really liked the way that the camera looked and was anxious to have one. Then I did a little research. I found out that Sony has there cameras made by an outside manufacturer. sony also does not share their technology with other manufacturers so if you want to accesorize, then you have to pay the inflated prices for \"genuine Sony parts\". Olympus has been in the camera biz for years. So I asked myself why am I going to buy a product from a company that doesn't really specialize in cameras? It is also good to know that there is only one kind of storage media that you can use with the Sony Cybershots. Conviently, Sony has also jacked the price on there \"Memory Sticks\" because it's the only thing that you can buy for it. The Olympus D460 does every thing that the Cybershot does, save for the swivel LCD display. The Olympus also uses smart card media, so you can be a little more selective in what can fit your budget. Speaking of budgets, I saved about $120.00, and still feel that I got a better camera that what Sony could ever offer.

The  TV wire is pretty cool, and even the pictures with the lowest quality look  pretty good on TV.  The LCD screen on the camera is very sharp and has  amazing color.

My first was the D360, which was a great camera until a child put the batteries in wrong and burned it up!  I cannot say enough good things about the D460Zoom...It writes the files quickly allowing follow-up shots in 2-3 seconds. It has easily understood controls, and takes better quality photos than most digital cameras I have seen -- including my brother's large and bulky Sony.  The autofocus and zoom both work without hitch and allow a considerable amount of leaway in composing your shots.  One of the things I find especially exciting is its ability to adopt to difficult lighting situations.  You can take pictures in very difficult bright and dark shadow conditions and get excellently exposed results.  I am comfortable taking pictures in any lighting situation, indoors or out.While there is some media that hold more pictures than the smart media cards, the smart media cards are very small and easy to use.  I bought a card reader [and] it is as easy to down load pics as to read a disk--faster even.

{"Title":"Excellent Camera but Maybe One Problem","Author":"wcc2","ReviewID":"RX76QA33CZXSV","Overall":"good","Content":"Overall I really like my D460, but having owned it now for half a year it has one weakness: the lengthy delay between taking consecutive photos. In the medium density \"HQ\" mode, each photo takes about 2-3 seconds to write to the SmartMedia memory card. This delay can be infuriating. When photographing evolving action, sometimes I take a photo too early - the action gets more interesting and I want to take another shot. But if it is within 2-3 seconds of taking a prior shot, the D460 can't help you. Press away at the shutter button all you want (even with the flash totally off). It is not listening.Frankly, most of the time this is not a problem. But this delay bother me so much that I went out and also bought the Olympus D490 Zoom, which is almost identical to the D460 but adds a RAM memory buffer. Delay between shots is almost zero. Shoot as fast as you want. Another advantage, having tested both of my cameras side-by-side, is that the D490 \"boots-up\" more quickly and therefore is ready to use just a fraction sooner. Instead of buying two cameras like me, maybe check out the D490 as well. Currently it is... more than the D460, and maybe worth it.Otherwise, the D460 has been a work-horse. I've shot about 1,000 images and surprisingly the TFT LCD display on the back of the camera has turned out to be quite scratch-resistant. After 6 months and a trip to Italy, it looks just as pristine as the LCD display on my new D490. Both fine cameras (though wish I owned only one).","Date":"September 27, 2000"}

Other reviews adequately describe why both are great cameras and which accessories you'll need.  Essentially, they're the same box(1.3 MegaPixel) and microcode. The same  \"darkroom\" software, CamediaMaster 1.2, comes with both. The 460  has a better user interface and a zoom.  The buttons and menus are somewhat  more intuitive, but the 360 interface isn't bad to begin with.  The digital  2x zoom is the same on both, the close-up (macro) mode on the 360 is  4\", vs. 8\" on the 460.  The feature set (e.g.: ISO, spot  metering) is similar, if there're any differences they're minor and subtle.  The ease-of-use factor of the 360 is better.  On the 460, you have to wait  for the lens to come out of the casing, and you must remember to open the  flash.  Unless you *really* need zoom, you can save yourself two hundred  bucks by purchasing the 360.","Date":"June 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Pleasing Prints!","Author":"James T. Leyden","ReviewID":"R3VF1SCCSW9PYV","Overall":"good","Content":"Consideration #1 - Why did I choose the Olympus over other \"computer\" brands? Because the Olympus line of digital cameras in general beats out any other line of cameras out there as far as picture quality, and the D460 is no exception. It is always a rule of thumb to buy cameras from a real camera company, if only because the optics will always be top notch.  Once you have taken pictures with a computer brand camera, and seen the prints, then switched to an Olympus or Nikon etc... you will definitely see the difference in quality.Consideration #2 - Why did I choose the D460 over a Nikon?The main factors were price and battery life.  The Nikon cameras take to sucking your batteries dry given even moderate use of the LCD, whereas the 400 series of Olympus cameras are quite the road warriors when it comes to batteries.  Now remember that this camera does not come with rechargeable batteries (it includes high-powered NiMH one time use batts) you should plan on spending the extra $30-50 on a set of rechargeable and a charger.  Other Points of Consideration -Also plan on getting another smart media card if you are going to take more than a few pictures in one use, because the included card (8mb SmartMedia) only holds 16 SHQ quality pictures, (the format with the best compromise between space and quality) SHQ mode uses a JPEG compression to make file size smaller. Adding a 16MB smartmedia card will get you 32 pictures at that compression, and a 32mb card will get you 64 pictures, and so on...  Also remember that you can readily exchange between cards when one gets full, so you don't loose the functionality of that original 8mb card that comes with the camera if you get another one. You can just take it out when it's full and stick in your new one. (just keep them in their case, and don't loose the little things, because boy are they expensive!)Verdict -Overall, this a really a great buy and will serve you well while on vacation, or at your kid's soccer game.  If you want to make your pictures bigger than 8x10, however, you might want to upgrade to the D490. If not, have fun with this great camera!","Date":"October 20, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great images, easy to use; accessory advice","Author":"reneereader","ReviewID":"R1HW6RCRVVCTES","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera takes excellent pictures, and once you take the time to orient yourself to the controls, it is very easy to use. I shopped around and got a good price on the D460 (less than $499) and am very, very happy. The  batteries have also lasted longer than I expected. I've taken pictures out  doors and indoors with and without flash. The flash has several settings,  much like a good SLR camera, but the camera can also adapt to low-light  without flash and keep the warm tones.A feature not often mentioned is  the fact that the camera includes a cable to hook it up to your TV and view  pictures at a large size, give a slide show to friends-- or even take  pictures while using the tv screen as a viewer. Surprisingly fun to do.I  followed another reviewer's recommendations and bought rechargeable AA NiMH  batteries and charger (the maha 1550s in a combo kit) at Thomas  Distributing for a good price. The Olympus tech support people told me just  to make sure you buy batteries with at least 1450 mAH--higher is better for  juicing those downloads. They do not recommend using any AC adapter other  than the olympus one because it might damage the camera (and I assume it  might violate your warranty), but other sources report that the one sold at  thomas distributing is fine. One more thing--if you buy another card, get  the Olympus brand if you intend to use the panorama feature--apparently  other cards don't support this.The only reason I give this camera 4 out  of 5 stars is that it doesn't connect to USB; the cable supports serial  ports and mac adb ports, but doesn't have a usb connection. This means you  have to buy a USB reader if you have a hot new computer, although you might  want to do this anyway.","Date":"July 14, 2000"}

The overall layout is great. 3) Picture quality is very  good. 4) 3X optical zoom is fairly powerful. 5) Many useful features, such  as panorama, date imprinting, manual ISO, varies of flash modes... 6) Comes  with 3 instruction booklets of 3 different languages so you don't need to  carry a thick manual for the part that you can't read. 7) Good overall  value, quality and features.Con: 1) Hard to tell if a photo has been  taken/captured because there's no clicking sound or other indications.  There are warning beeps and orange/green warning lights, but they come on  for many different reasons. 2) the flash light does not automatically pop  open when turn on the camera, so if there is not enough light, it's really  hard to tell if the picture has been taken. So the flash light has to be  manually pop open in order for it to be automatic. Manytimes I have to read  the picture count or \"write\" indication to be sure that a picture  is indeed captured. 3) The softwere that comes with the package has limited  features. 4) No AC adaptor comes with the package (I know, asking for  SmartMedia or UBS adaptor is really too much).Note: If you have software  for other serial devices installed, make sure you exit them (modem and  serial mouse have NO problem). For example, I have PalmPilot's HotSync  software installed, and it conflicts with this photo software (The warning  messages do not help at all as in all cases). I called Olympus technical  support, and get the answer without much waiting.","Date":"June 2, 2000"}

{"Title":"Review from an average Joe!!","Author":"Chad Krizan","ReviewID":"R3JG9HRWLF4BN9","Overall":"good","Content":"I don't know much about digital cameras, but I just purchased the D460 Zoom and love it!!First of all, since I don't know much about photography, I love how this camera does all the work for you, it tells you when you need to use flash, auto-focuses, etc.  It is very easy to use.  About 15 minutes after opening the box I already had a couple pictures taken and loaded onto my computer, this included software installation and everything!!  I love how you can see the pictures on the screen immediately after you take them, so you can see if they turned out or not.Just to address a few of the problems that I read in other reviews.  One person commented on how you get drained on the batteries.  The simple solution is to buy some rechargable NiMH batteries with a charger.  The NiMH batteries last a long time to start with anyways!!  Another problem that was addressed is that it can be tedious to find your pictures on the camera if you go through them one by one.  There is a setting on the camera so that you can put 9 thumbnails of the pictures on your screen at the same time, so finding your pictures really is not a problem!!I also recommend buying a USB Smartmedia Reader.  I believe I read that they are 80 times faster than using the connection provided with the camera.  Also, if you use the USB Smartmedia Reader, you do not need to waste the camera batteries while you load pics onto your computer, since the camera isn't even involved in the loading process if you use the USB Reader.Also, just as a side note, a 16 or 32 MB smartmedia card is nice if you plan on using the high quality settings.This really doesn't have to do with the camera, but if you plan on buying these extra add-ons, I really suggest using Ebay, you can get some great deals!!  I bought all the add-ons off from Ebay and spent about 100 dollars less than I would have elsewhere.To sum it all up, I think this camera is an excellent choice whether you have no idea how to use a digital camera (such as myself) or are a pro!  The controls are extremely easy to figure out with a tad of help from the instruction manual.  Also, for such a simple and easy to use camera, it takes excellent, clear, crisp, pictures, which really surprised me when I first saw them!  I highly recommend this camera!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is I think it should come standard with the USB reader, to save us consumers a little money.  Although not at all necessary, it still would be nice!!I hope this helps you all out on your digital camera purchase!!","Date":"March 23, 2001"}

The reviewers don't mention where to find these  products.If you are considering non-Olympus products, with your favorite  search engine... for the fastpath use \"flashpath and smartmedia\"  (since there are three types of flashpath standards, \"smartmedia\"  is what Olympus uses).

Second, after taking a picture, you can just review if for about a second or two, if you want to review it again, you have to turn off the camera, and turn on the LCD display again.. very unconvenient. Third, we have to lift the flash light to make it work. well, it is not totally automatic.

I love it!It's a rugged camera that I use for documenting local events for publishing almost daily on the web. For my  purposes, it does a wonderful job. The pictures are excellent for  publishing on the web and are still good enough for printing out on  photographic paper.With a 16MB card (purchased separately), I get 73  pictures at High Quality mode or 218 at Standard Quality mode. With that  many shots available I feel free to take many shots knowing that I'll end  up with only a few good ones.

One thing  to note is that there is a delay of about 1 second between the time you  press the shutter button and the time the camera actually takes the  picture.One of the things that sold me on the Olympus was the built-in  lens cover.

Simple. Easy to use. Treat it like a straight point and shoot and just click away.  The zoom feature lets you frame what you're looking at IN THE VIEWFINDER(almost like an SLR). The standard PnS green light-red light also tells you when everything's ready and then --bingo-- you've got another good picture.  The D460 also has some bells and whistles that advanced amateurs or even pros will like.  My favorite:  a white balance adjustment that lets you use the available light from fluorescents or incandescants. That's an important feature, because this camera is very sensitive in even low light, and it permits good, color balanced photos in marginal light.  My earlier digital camera experience was with a Sony Mavica MD90, a much more expensive camera.  Frankly that Sony can't hold a candle to the D460.  Accessories: I bought the SanDisk FlashPath (Floppy Disk Adapter) with the D460 to eliminate PC cable hookups.  This took some looking because many retailers are out of them. But it was worth the search, because this particular FDA comes with batteries installed and a simple no-fuss installation disk.

{"Title":"Awesome camera for the $$$","Author":"Mark Cumberland","ReviewID":"R1V3WUPZI64ZV","Overall":"good","Content":"This is my second digital camera, replacing a Casio QV-700. The picture quality seems excellent and I was amazed at how vivid the colors turn out  with this camera. I have taken about a hundred pictures with the camera so  far and all but a few turned out excellent, and the ones that didn't were  my fault. One big advantage this camera has over my Casio is that the LCD  monitor has it's own power switch, so you can leave it off while taking  pictures and it saves on battery power.  There are several settings  such as ISO, white balance, etc that can be manually adjusted for better  picture quality or left on automatic if you rather not mess with them (like  myself). The on-screen menus are pretty user friendly after you read the  manual.  With the included 8MB Smartmedia card, you can record from  2-122 photos, depending on which of the 5 quality settings you choose. In  the 1280x960 resolution mode, you can take 36 pics in High Quality mode  (default), 18 in Super High Quality, or 2 pics in Super High Quality-TIFF  (uncompressed). In the 640x480 resolution mode, you can take 32 pics in  High Quality mode or 122 in Normal mode. Picking up a 16, 32, or 64 MB card  will greatly increase your capacity. I plan on getting a 32 MB card myself,  which will reportedly hold 146 pics in 1280x960 High Quality mode (or up to  489 pics in 640x480 normal mode).  The 3x zoom was better than expected.  There are a few things about the camera that I don't care for, such as  the main power switch. Instead of having an actual switch, you have to open  the lens barrier, which isn't a problem, however when you go to turn the  camera off, you have to close the lens barrier part way, then wait for the  lens to retract, then close the cover completely. Also, you must manually  flip up the flash.  Although there are a few minor things I wish were  different, don't pass up this camera!","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

It has great zoom features, an easy to see lcd screen(indoors), easy to follow instruction manual and the 1.31 megapix is good enough quality to make my family ooh and ahh at the photos. However, there are a few drawbacks 1.31 megapix is only good up to 8x10 enlargements before it gets very grainy, you can't see the lcd screen in bright daylight ( this would hold true for any other camrea with an lcd as well ) While it comes with 8 megs of memory I bought a 32 mb upgrade so I could hold more than 32 photos. The serial interface for downloads is agonizingly slow, so you'll need a card reader as an accessory.

I've read quite a bit of reviews, both here and elsewhere and I pretty much had it narrowed down to a few models but I'm glad I went with this one.  I've had good experiences with Olympus film cameras before and it seems their high quality transferred over to the digital scene as well.  Sure, it's only 1.3 Megapixels and it might be a bit pricy for one considering you can get a 2.0 Megapixel camera cheaper but, the user friendliness and the sheer number of features make this camera far superior to the higher megapixel cheaper models.First off the pictures are crisp and clear and with the optical veiw finder available, you don't need to mess with the LCD screen and waste batteries.  The menu screen is easy to navigate (though a bit difficult to figure out the icons...) and this is truly where this camera shines.  Not only are you able to change the picture quality from standard 640 X 480 to uncompressed TIFFs, but you have to ability to adjust white balance, and more importantly, the ISO value!  You can also adjust the exposure compensations and, if you are using an Olympus memory card, you can do panorama shots as well.  Flipping through the pictures already in the card is a breeze, especially since you can use an idex view to see up to 16 shots at one time and deleting pictures is a snap.Unfortunately this camera doesn't come with USB support (...wonder why???) but pick up a USB card reader along with the camera and the problem is solved.  I picked up a PNY USB Flash Card Reader for ... and it installed in a second and transfering 6 shots at one time to the HD was almost instantaneous.If you're going on a long trip, you might want to either buy a bigger memory card and/or bring a pocket full of AA batteries but, for all intents and purposes, this is a great camera for us \"point and shoot\" types.

I have even had very good luck using the flash in macro mode.  Using the macro mode in combination with the 3:1 optical zoom, I can take a full frame photo of a silver dollar.I had great fun using the D460's panorama mode on a trip to the Grand Canyon.  The Olympus software automatically stiches multiple images into a single, very high resolution, panorama.  One word of caution:  Certain features, such a the panorama mode, are only supported when you use genuine Olympus smart media cards.  Don't buy \"compatible\" smart media cards even if they are gauranteed to be 100% compatible.Like most digital cameras, the flash on the D460 is very close to the lense.  Consequently, red eye can be a problem.  The D460 is equipped with a red eye flash function which usually helps to prevent red eye.  Often, I still find that it necessary to remove red eye with the Olympus software that came with the camera.If you plan to spend less than $400, I highly recommend the D460.","Date":"December 17, 2000"}

Let me tell you that I'm am on fire!  I love this thing!  I can take 18 superfine shots or over 30 med quality pics.  In fact, here's a med quality pic right  here: [...] (352kb).  That was taken with simply  pointing and clicking, so it would have looked even better had I changed  some settings.  This camera has plenty of more adjustments to make (and I  will love learning them).However, expect to buy a USB reader and another  card (I bought the \"Viking IntelliFlash USB Flash Memory Reader\"  and  \"SanDisk SDSM-32-490 32MB SmartMedia Card\") which will add a  little over a hundred bucks more to the price.  Also, the software  sometimes doesn't seem to recognize when the camera is plugged in (no big  deal, just turn off and on again) and with the serial connection plan on  waiting a long while!  Once I get me reader, I plan to not even use the  software provided unless I want to change some settings in the camera (like  the time), or if I want to stitch pan shot together.I do want to address  one thing a guy said about its feel.  It does NOT have a cheap feel.  YES,  it has a plastic case, but it doesn't have that cheap feel like some of  Fuji's lower end cameras (if you've held that square one they have, you'll  know what I mean).  The 460 has the feel of its $200 range 35MM  brethren--which is what I would expect.To top this all off, I've yet to  change the batteries!Bottom line...I love it!","Date":"June 28, 2000"}

{"Title":"Olympus","Author":"\"stewartboyz\"","ReviewID":"R9LMJI19EI4V4","Overall":"good","Content":"My Olympus 460 Zoom is a great little camera that features both ease of use for occasional snapshots and advanced capabilities for the more serious photographer.  It is my second digital camera, my first was a Fuji MX-1200, a really great little camera also.  The Olympus is not quite as easy to use as the Fuji but after my recent trip to China, I wanted something a little more capable than the Fuji.  Since I consider myself an \"advanced amateur\", I have been giving all the \"bells and whistles\" a workout since I got it.I am particularly pleased with ability to spot meter for back lit situations, shoot \"burst mode\", the zoom, and the ability to select the \"ISO\" (film speed).  The exposures I get with the Olympus are also more accurate than the Fuji.  The Fuji tended to underexpose in all but bright sunlight, forcing me to do a lot of image adjusting in Photoshop.  The Olympus is generally \"right on\".  I also really like the software bundled with the Olympus.  I purchased a USB Smartmedia reader for the Fuji because I couldn't get the Fuji software to install under Windows 2000.  The Olympus software installed fine under Win2K and works really well.  It may even cut down the time I spend with Photoshop.I really, really like the quality of the resulting images.  Olympus makes fine lenses and It's SHQ (Super High Quality) mode lets you take either uncompressed TIFF images as well as \"low compression\" JPEG's.  I have printed images suitable for framing on an HP2000 Cse and a Tektronix Phaser 850 up to 8 x 10.  They compare very favorably with images taken with my 35MM SLR and scanned on my Epson Perfection.Finally, the highest praise I can give this camera is that I am giving serious consideration to leaving my assortment of cameras, lenses, motor drives, filters etc. home on my next trip.  Hope this helps.","Date":"January 15, 2001"}

{"Title":"Great Cammera but a battery eater!","Author":"Agustin A Barrutia","ReviewID":"R265DT174ZHYH7","Overall":"good","Content":"Well first of all I should say that this camera is perfect for the principiant or \"tourist\" photographer, that the only thing he want's to do is to capture the moment without controlling it all. The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER! (forget about the sound).  The worst part of the camera is the battery consumption. I got tired of wasting lots of $ buying more and more batteries. It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something. Maybe you woun't take this to serious when you buy an item. But what I can tell you is that wasting 4$ (here that's what it costs 4 AA batt) for just 15 minutes is not a deal.","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

I have been very pleased with the overall performance of this camera.  You will never want to use a film camera again!  Knowing what your pictures look like while you can still retake them is great!  The LCD screen is usually enough to see what your picture will look like or you can view your pictures on the TV.  Included is a NTSC video output cable to plug the camera into the \"video in\" on your TV or VCR.  You really notice the excellent quality of the image that way, as well as a great way to share your pictures with everyone in the room. It comes with batteries, Mac/WIN serial cable, 8MB memory card, & software.  Everything you need to open the box and start clicking.The instructions included are easy to follow.  The software is limited on the editing it will do, however I have found that I don't really want to edit most pictures, because they turn out fine.  The 8MB SmartMedia card included is adequate.  I purchased a 64MB card and don't regret it!  You can take around 730 pictures on SQ-high quality, 250 pictures on HQ and 150 pictures on SHQ.  More than enough for a trip where you aren't able to upload pictures to your computer and clear your memory card. The downside, it eats batteries like all digital cameras.  Purchase the Olympus battery charger and TWO sets of batteries for it.  That way you are always covered with a spare set charged.  Remember your printer will determine the quality your prints are going to be.  A regular inkjet (like the Lexmark 3200) just doesn't have the quality that one like the HP Photosmart P1000 does.  I can print an 8x10 picture (SHQ) on the HP that is photo quality. Pick up a camera case too because it doesn't come with one.  Hint: You really don't have to buy anything extra to make this a great purchase.  The rechargeable batteries, 64MB card, and camera case are not absolutely necessary to enjoy this camera.  Just stuff that I found after using it for a year makes it a little bit nicer.","Date":"November 23, 2001"}

I struggled a little with loading the batteries and all of the menu options, but once I got everything set up and working, everything was great.  If you haven't yet used a digital camera, you're going to love it.  It is great seeing the pictures right away and being able to delete the bad shots.  As far as this specific camera goes, you can't beat the price for the features.  I did a lot of comparison shopping - reading reviews, etc & I am convinced this is a great deal.  I especially like the option where it will take 4 pictures in a row very fast.  I got great action shots of my cats fighting that I would have never been able to take with a regular camera.  A word of advice that I heard from a techie friend:  Go out and buy the NiMH rechargeable batteries and recharge those before you get your camera.  Apparently the rechargeable batteries lose their power even when they are not being used (i.e.  in your camera bag), but the lithium batteries don't.  You should save the lithium batteries as backups in case you are stuck with dead rechargeables.","Date":"December 20, 2000"}

I never had a digital camera before and after doing a lot of research and reading reviews like these I settled on this camera.  It was  definitely the right choice.  Compared to some higher end cameras it was  very reasonably priced and worth the risk.  I didn't want to buy my first  digital camera for $800. The quality of the LCD is great so you can review  your pictures immediately and clearly.  The camera is so easy to use.  I  had it figured out for the most part before opening the instructions, but I  would definitely give those a look.  The zoom is good for the price of the  camera.  The best thing about this digital camera is that it is the size of  a regular camera.  There is no extra baggage.  It fits into a regular  camera case with no problems.Downloading the pictures is really easy.  I  did purchase a reader for the Smart Media Cards (which is basically the  film) which really quickens the downloading to computer process.  It was  only like $30.  I also got some rechargeable batteries, but I didn't even  need them until 8 days into my honeymoon.  The orginal batteries lasted a  long time and through a lot of exploring.I would suggest getting a  bigger Smart Media card than the one that comes with the camera (8mb).  I  got a 32 mb card which basically gives you close to 200 pictures in the  middle range of quality.For a non-professional who just wants to capture  moments of fun and wants the ease of downloading them to the computer and  then sending them to people, this camera is perfect.  I haven't tried to  have them printed up by a website yet, but I will do that soon.  It is a  solid product and I would always side toward Olympus.","Date":"June 25, 2000"}

{"Title":"Still a good camera, but showing its age.","Author":"Chan Lee Meng","ReviewID":"R1JYUPWESJ0L71","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought my D-460 in Sept last year. I would have given it a 4-star rating then, but now it warrants only 3 stars from me. After 10 months of steady use, I can now point out its deficiencies:1. The lack of USB connection which makes it horribly slow to download pictures. It can take up to 10 minutes to download a full card! I had to buy a SM card reader to save time, which meant more $$ required.2. A very noticeable shutter lag, i.e. there is a delay of about .5 to .75 sec between the time you press the shutter release, and when the camera actually captures the shot. This camera is definitely not suitable for capturing \"the decisive moment\". If you've previously used an anolog SLR camera (like I did), this delay is unacceptable.3. There is also noticeable barrel distortion from the lens. Basically it means the lens makes people look fat and straight lines bulge outwards. To be fair, this is a fairly common problem in consumer digicams, and you can fix the problem with good photo-editing software. 4. The \"guillotine\" lens cover. It is quite easy to bash the lens when trying to close the retractable lens cover. You're supposed to slide the cover forward SLIGHTLY (but not touch the lens), wait for the lens to completely retract into the camera, then slide the cover completely shut. Whose bright idea was that?!Don't get me wrong though. This camera still serves me well (I work for a newspaper). The D-460 has many plus points which others have covered previously, so I won't repeat them. But before you decide to buy it, consider the four drawbacks I mentioned above.","Date":"July 14, 2001"}
{"Title":"Good camera, but some noticable drawbacks","Author":"\"miklaustin\"","ReviewID":"R311Y3QWJNRX7M","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had this camera for about 4 months.  Starting out, I thought wow, this camera has everything: zoom, autofocus, flash, memory cards, the whole bit.  But somethings i've noticed about it sometimes get me to worrying about it. First of all, everytime you open the screen, it takes about 3 or 4 seconds for the zoom lens to pop in and/or out.  This is bad because it wastes the batteries if you keep doing it for taking different pictures. Next, when taking the picture, you push the button, and it takes about 1 second for the shutter to actually flash.  I think this is because of all the focusing and dithering. Also, you can use the viewfinder to see pictures once you take them.  But to review them, you have to completely close the lens, wait the 3 or 4 seconds, and then hit a button to turn on the screen and wait for the picture to load.  This is not absolutely horrible, but sometimes I am in a hurry. Biggest thing:  While taking the biggest quality picture.. the camera will take like an entire minute to load the picture to the disk.  This is horrible because in a minute, the thing you may be shooting will be gone, or the group of people will become antzy. The serial port is so slow, its like having a really slow internet download.  On the plus side, the camera takes wonderful pictures.  It has 2 sizes, the larger size has 3 quality options, and the smaller has 3.  The higher quality ones look quite nice.  Very clear, very good lighting.  Everyone always complains because the pictures are so clear, you can see every blemish. Overall, great camera, but sometimes the lengthiness of the operations can be a bit overcoming.","Date":"July 11, 2001"}

It's the only digital camera I've owned and I really enjoy it.  It's been on several vacations and numerous holidays with us and I seem to learn something new about it each time I use it. Once you read the manual several times and figure out the menus, you get the hang of what settings will provide the best shot.  The Auto setting will cover most normal conditions, but special settings are required to get shots of things that are moving or have unusual lighting.  It's easy to experiment and just dispose of the bad shots.  Battery life is good, but I strongly advise two sets of rechargables to always be prepared.  The download of pictures through the provided serial cable can be slow, but just relax and have a cup of coffee.  I've used numerous Internet services to develop my digital pictures and the quality is as good as any 35mm.  The advantage here is that you get to always pick out a perfect picture.

But keep the SLR...","Author":"Charles White","ReviewID":"R2QCD3E5CDGPX2","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had more photo fun and taken more pictures since buying  this camera than during the rest of my life put together.  With no film to lose I can really make sure I like a picture by doing what the pro's do: take a lot of pictures and select the best ones.  I generally run the 460 at maximum resolution since it isn't particularly endowed in the pixel area.  The color rendition is excellent as well as the autoexposures.  Basically, if you can see it, it can photograph it.  Some of the night shots are quite impressive.The 3X optical zoom is good.  I wouldn't have a digital camera without it.  The lens is prone to \"barrel distortion\" where straight line things like poles and trees at the edges of the frame appear to bend toward the center.  A little strategic framing can make that less of a problem.  The camera is rather slow when trying to do live action shots.  It takes about a second between button press and shutter release.  This is an eternity when trying to photograph my son doing a bike trick or catching a hawk on the wing.  Being an old SLR hobbyist, I miss my telephoto and my filters.  I miss an instant shutter release and other areas of total control. In fact, we're shopping for a replacement for our old Canon AT-1. An SLR digital camera with the capabilities of a film SLR is just  way too expensive for me right now.  So I will continue to have two cameras: my super fun and somewhat amazing D-460Z and my SLR. Each with its own strengths, each with its own creativity.","Date":"August 8, 2001"}
{"Title":"Great bang for the buck","Author":"S. Winder \"computer nerd\"","ReviewID":"R1JXR9JS595GLJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have owned this camera for about a year now. It takes excellent pictures and is well-suited for producing photo-quality prints. It writes the pictures to memory at a decent speed, and has a rapid sequential mode at the lowest resolution. There is a slight delay for autofocus when you take the picture, but if you depress the button halfway while you're setting up the shot, pressing the button the rest of the way will take the picture instantly (much the same as in many autofocus 35mm cameras).Battery life with the included lithium batteries is excellent, but beware--they cost about [price]each (you need two). I have had a lot of success using rechargeable NiMH batteries; the battery life with NiMH is still decent, and it doesn't cost much more to get started with them than it does to buy a replacement lithium set.Picture quality leaves nothing to be desired. You even have the option of taking pictures in a lossless format (TIFF as opposed to JPEG). This is great for pictures that you need to enlarge. Note, though, that one or two uncompressed pictures can fill up the average-sized memory card. The special features work well and can be useful, although the default settings are good enough that the average point-and-shoot user will never need to change them. The lighting and macro features are particularly well-done; you can take close-up shots in macro mode that would typically require an SLR camera in the world of film.The camera's weakest point is in its serial link. It works fine, but you can spend a long time waiting for the pictures to transfer to your computer. It would be wise to figure the cost of a USB smartmedia reader into the total price for the camera--with my Lexar reader, the images transfer in a matter of seconds.I did a lot of research before buying this camera and can say that I was not in the least disappointed with the results. You would be hard-pressed to find a worthy competitor in this price range.","Date":"July 18, 2001"}

If not, you'll waste too much time downloading images. For example, an 8MB clip full of  images (about 17 at Super High Quality mode) takes about 10 minutes to download via my PowerMac's serial port. Download times thru a PC serial port are about the same. Contrast this to about 20 seconds with a ZiO USB smartmedia reader. I bought this camera about 6 months ago for ... from another vendor. And that was WITHOUT a card reader. ... current deal offers much better value.Another flaw in this model is its \"guillotine\" sliding cover feature. While the design looks elegant, it's also quite easy to bash the lens with the sliding cover (you need to push the cover halfway to trigger the lens retraction into the body).Also note that this camera doesn't come with an AC adapter (that's \"optional\"), so you'd also drain your batteries if you download pix via serial port. Did I mention that a USB smartmedia reader should be mandatory with this camera?On the plus side, this camera does takes great pictures, has a wider aperture (f2.8) than most cameras in this range, and also a great panorama feature with stitching software.

First, it takes a fairly long time to warm up (perhaps a minute or more). This makes capturing those special and fleeting moments difficult. By the time the camera is ready to photo our 18-month daughter has moved on... Second, the ability to alternate between viewing photos and taking new ones is slow and unwieldy. In order to view pictures you've already taken, you need to close the lens cover. This is slow because the zoom needs to retract. Similarly, to switch to photo mode from viewing mode, the camera needs to be reopened. Finally, the ability to delete picturs is also quirky. You need to switch to viewing mode to delete and it take a few steps. All of these features make the use of the camera really slow and annoying.

Having to slide it partway closed, let the lense retract and the finish closing is a bit strange. The other thing and what I think is the most serious flaw is the serial cable connection. It is very slow. Olympus should have included either a USB connection instead or some kind of USB media reader or floppy adapter. I realize some people do not have a USB port which is probably why the serial connection is still in use. All-in-all, the camera is a great value and high quality for the money. If you can afford the extra money, buy the D490Z instead. But again, this camera works great. The images are generally clear and in focus and the software does a great job of removing redeye and auto adjusting the brightness and contrast. Of course, like any camera, digital or film, there will be some bad shots. The plus is you can delete these and try again.","Date":"April 7, 2001"}

I was impressed by it's size and features.  It takes great pictures.  The only down side is the serial connection to the PC.  I spent 3 days trying to connect this to my PC unsuccessfully.  The Olympus support wasn't very helpful.  They blamed the problem on my serial port.  I fooled with that for 3 days then finally I gave up and went out and bought the San Disk Image Mate smart media reader with USB.  It worked right out of the box and is very fast.The camera is great, now that I got the pictures into my PC.

{"Title":"Excellent camera with an amazing precision design!","Author":"Minh N.

I have read all the reviews on this web page before I decided to purchase one.  And was I glad that I did choose this one.  Quite a few people warned about the lid that cover the lense, they said that if you are not carefull, you could damage the lense.  But I found out that it was design so that the lid stop before the lense retract without touching the lense.  I tried about a hundred times to see if it rubbed against the lense, but fail to make the lid rub against or scratch it.  So my conclusion is that it was design with an amazing precision; to the naked eyes, it looks like the lid rub against the lense but there is always a small space between the lid and the lense to guarantee that the lid will never damage the lense.  Beside the precision design of the lid, this camera takes great pictures every time.  I tried it in a totally dark room with the flash of course, and it turned out to be like a picture was taken out doors.","Date":"December 15, 2000"}

And you always have the ability to manually set everything about the camera - ISO, brightness, resolution, etc.I've done some panoramas with this, as well as dark and inside photos (the latter two things my previous digital camera had no luck with).I've also amazingly been able to take pictures of magazines articles and been able to easily read the text in the resulting pictures.  Don't ned my scanner anymore! ;)The burst mode is a nice feature, though not strictly neccessary.  Macro works great and the digital zoom combined with the optical zoom is a great feature.

The batteries (which everyone  seemed to gripe about) are still the originals.  It's just so easy to do.  I absolutely recommend this as the pictures are of high quality.  I used it  at my sisters wedding, printed a picture and framed it.  The printing of  the pic was a test but came out so good it now is framed and nobody would  know the difference.  (It was printed on ordinary office paper!)  The only  drawback to this camera is the lens cover which you need to push halfway  over to retract the lens.  You just need to be gentle.

I am crazy about this camera, and I have convinced at least three other people to buy it.The D-460Z is lightweight, comes with a flash, digital and optical zoom, and optical and LCD viewfinders.  I generally use the LCD viewfinder because it's convenient.  The camera will take low-light shots without the flash, which has been a nice transition from the 35mm film cameras I've had in the past.  The zoom is also a very nice feature that I didn't have on my film cameras.The camera uses SmartMedia storage cards, which can be bought at Wal-Mart and Target.  They're not very expensive.  The camera came with the 8mb SmartMedia card, which holds 36 images when the pictures are stored at the default size (about twice the size that I like to send in emails).  It also only comes with the serial port connector.  Many people feel that this is too slow, but I have no problems with it.  It probably takes 5-10 minutes to download 36 images from the camera.  You can purchase a SmartMedia card reader that connects via a USB port.  That is supposed to be faster, but I haven't found it necessary.I have bought a few extra components for the camera.  It does not come with a case, but it fits normal 35mm camera cases fine.  I bought a 32mb SmartMedia storage card (holds about 144 images in default size) as well as a four-pack of NiMH batteries and a recharger.  The camera came with batteries that lasted quite a long time, but when they went out, it was nice to have the rechargeables.  The rechargeable batteries will last me about a weekend of picture-taking before requiring a night in the recharger.  The camera will use regular AA batteries, but you will have to change them at least once a day.I have been very happy with this camera and I strongly urge others to purchase one as well.  I have found the software and the LCD control panel to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.","Date":"October 11, 2001"}

This is my first attempt at digital photography, and I wanted a camera that would take pictures of excellent quality, but wasn't too complicated to use.  (I don't know much about manual settings for different situations and lighting, etc.)  I love the way you have a choice as to whether to just point and shoot, or to adjust things first.  The settings are so easy to understand and the menu so intuitive that even I can change the settings manually if need be.  I did purchase immediately the following accessories:  a USB reader, a 64 MB SmartMedia card, a battery charger and two sets of rechargeable batteries, and a case.  I considered these items \"must haves\" for the sake of speed and convenience.  I would recommend this camera without reservation to novices and experienced digital photographers alike.  The picture quality is amazing, and I've already had some prints made by Ofoto.com from pictures I've taken on this camera.  You would never guess that they weren't made from conventional film.

It have 3 different quality settings as well as film speed options.  The 8mb card is good if you're not taking over 200 photos a day.

Having an iMac with only USB ports was a concern, but an Entrega USB-to-Serial converter works just fine.  Downloads are a bit slow to the computer.  The battery life is amazing in these cameras, as long as you don't use the viewing screen much (normally it is off when you're taking photos using the manual viewfinder).  I've had this camera for over a month with the same set of orginal batteries.  At 122 photos in standard quality, I've taking hundreds of photos on one set.  I have purchased a AA battery charger and a few spare sets of NiMH AA batteries (from Batteries Plus).The photo quality is amazing.  I've had some problems with the MACRO mode-- the image seems to want to be much higher than what I'm pointing at, but other than that, the camera is great.Night photos only work with a tripod... and photos of bright objects at night (such as the Moon) really do not turn out well.  So this is pretty much a daylight or flash camera.I'm not sure  you can even purchase this camera any more, but I prefer the optics to some of the newer models.It also has a cord to  hook up to your TV-- we have watched some of my photo shoots on big screen TV's.. which is just great.

The pictures are first rate.  For a \"lower\" priced camera, it is full of all of the bells and whistles you could ask for.  The  Panorama feature is my favorite.  If you're not into gizmos, just point and  shoot.  It's very simple.  I've never used one before and I was e-mailing  pictures to my family within 30 minutes after the UPS driver handed it to  me.Only two minor complaints.  The attached lens cover (which is great)  has to be closed part way until the lens retracts back into the camera.  This has to be done gingerly as it is too easy to jam it against the side  of the lens by accident.  Also, on the top of the camera is a small  electronic control panel that tells you how many pictures you have left,  picture quality etc.  The symbols across the top row are very hard to see  as they are too close to the camera body.  A slight shadow covers them  unless you have plenty of light.All things considered, I'd buy it again  in a second.","Date":"June 21, 2000"}

It has all the features and functions necessary to take quality pictures and enjoy them in digital fashion.  The camera is sturdy, lightweight, and easy to use.I'm still working with the supplied software.  All in all it was easy to install and use, although I am puzzled by its inability to allow you to edit out things like red-eye.  I'm using another piece of software for that.A couple of peeves:  Although its nice not to worry about a lense cap, the motorized sliding cover seems to inviting trouble in the long term.  Also, the LCD screen is excruciatingly slow when scrolling through previous pictures.  I haven't found a way to randomly access them on the camera, so you have to go through them one by one, which, when you have 30 or 40 stored up, is very tedious.Overall, you could spend more and get some 'extra' features, but I doubt its worth it.

Decent quality, decent zoom, at a good value.  Today, I'd recommend spending the extra bucks to get something with a better optical zoom (you can't rely on the digital zoom for quality) and higher megapixels.  But as far as delivering what this camera advertises, it is right on.Based on my experience, I plan to buy another model from Olympus when I upgrade.  The durability factor alone makes them worth it.The Olympus cammedia software that comes for downloading your pictures does leave something to be desired.  It's a very slow interface.

Though I disliked the switchto the cheaper plastic housing with this model, the increased ease of use when navigating the menus more than makes up for it. Like the previous camera, you still get high-quality digital pictures with a number of features including red-eye removing flash, television display of pictures, 3x optical (lens) and 2x digital (computer) zoom, and a host of other features which make this camera one of the best in it's class. But since the earlier releases in this line, digital camera technology has increased while price has decreased (thanks in a large part to earlier models in this line, which took the market by storm). You can now get cameras with a higher level of megapixels and resolution for about the same price as the D-460Z such as Nikon's Coolpix 800 and the Kodak DC280. You should go to your local. . . consumer electronics store and look at ALL of your choices before deciding on which model to purchase (and then purchase it on-line because it is cheaper ;). Even though the D-460Z is no longer \"cutting edge,\" I still believe it has enough features and stunning quality to let it surpass many of the other choices in its class. Accessories: Expect to spend a few hundred dollars in additional accessories for this camera. I recommend at least 8 NiMH rechargable batteries for power (which you can buy on-line or at your local supermarket), a USB Smartmedia reader if your computer supports USB (this greatly decreases SLOW picture transfer times from the camera to the computer), and a \"soft\" protective case for the camera (the Olympus soft leather case is nice but over-priced unless you get it on sale). As well, 2 additional 32 meg or a 64 meg SmartMedia card is useful, and will allow you to take a vacation's worth of pictures without have to delete any (at least at the rate I take pictures). The camera lets you take a little more than 2x the SmartCard's megs in super-high quality, compressed images. You can buy these on-line at places like amazon.com... but the Olympus-brand accessories tend to go out of stock quickly.  Note: the SmartMedia cards will eventually wear out, though you'll be able to take tens of thousand (or even hundreds of thousands) of pictures before this happens if you buy a decent-quality card.","Date":"May 19, 2000"}

Thanks to a few helpful people in the ... community I was able to fix the problem, ( I'll repeat the tip I got which was to deactivate any Palm synchronization routines - really easy to do)I have been using the camera constantly since then. It was especially useful when our baby was born recently. We live in New York and have no familly here so I took a lot of pictures that were emailed to family and friends around the world. We received many compliments on the quality of the pictures.So I am now very very happy with the camera and rate it 5 stars plus. It is simple to use and easy to pop into a small bag and carry around with you. In the past few months it has travelled with me constantly. Although I bought this camera for my wife I found that I also used it a lot...so I bought another one! My poor Nikon SLR system hasn't seen the light of day for months!A great camera!","Date":"July 17, 2001"}

It has held up beautifully despite my lack of carrying case and my tendency to just throw it in the car, in a backpack, etc.  The exterior is scratched due to my carelessness, but the camera still takes terrific quality photos.  I have had momentary pangs of jealousy when I see the sleek, pretty little cameras that are on the market now, but I have no reason to replace my Olympus, as it works so well.  It's like the watch in those old commercials- it takes a lickin, but keeps on tickin!  FABULOUS value and you won't be disappointed if you buy this model.Update: January 2010.  Local retailers have replaced photo printing machines and the new ones do not have slots for this camera's smart card.  DH has pointed out that we can transfer photos onto a usb stick and bring that to the store, but this involves an extra step that I really don't need.  Maybe it is time to invest in a newer model.","Date":"December 3, 2008"}

Boeck \"Java Mama\"","ReviewID":"RD8E816YU2UBS","Overall":"good","Content":"I got this camera several years ago, when it first came out.I also paid over twice what it is going for now.  I tried ita few times and thought that it was too difficult to printmy own photos (I take lots!)  I put it away, and went backto my Olympus film camera.  A few weeks ago, 20 minutes intomy niece's wedding shower, my 35mm camera stopped working! No time to run around hoping the nearest store had a battery.Panic set in.  Then I remembered my digital.  I called someoneto bring it to the party.  I barely remembered how to use it . .but the pictures turned out very well.  I've managed to losethe manual, so some things are a mystery to me - I'll justhave to practice with it.  But I am pleased with the picturequality.  So pleased, in fact, that I just ordered the OlympusC5500. The 460-d will be my \"back-up\".  Now that you can go andprint pictures for pennies, I'm going to give digital photographyanother try. I think that this would be a good camera for youngadults and for the infrequent photographer.  Those who arethe \"family photographer\" at parties, or who take pictures oftheir small children, or enjoy outdoor sceneic photography arebetter off spending $75 more for a more advanced camera.As for Olympus quality . . .I have always gone back to themwhen purchasing my cameras.  I upgrade every 2 1/2 - 3 years.Olympus ought to be sending me commissions . . . I'verecommended them to everyone who has asked, \"What kind ofcamera do you use?\"  I know that at least 25 people havepurchased Olympus cameras because I have recommended them.My only complaint: NO NECK STRAP!  They only use wrist straps.Any parent who is trying to wrangle a toddler, a bored 10 yearold and a puppy for a portrait knows that a wrist strap isnot practical.  Most events where you take pictures are hectic:fairs, parties, sporting events.  You are more likely to putdown your camera if there is only a wrist strap . . .youneed your hands for other things, like holding onto your5 year old niece, paying for your beer or clutching ontoyour ticket.  I recommend getting a small, practical camerabag that you can attach to a belt loop or has a neckstrap -something that you can access easily.","Date":"August 3, 2005"}

This takes terrific pictures (you see the results right away), and if you're not happy with the result, just erase and take another picture!  This camera is lightweight, and easily fits in a pocket or a fanny pack.  It does use a lot of battery power, so buy some rechargeable batteries with your purchase.  I have an old HP color Deskjet printer, and the photos I print are good enough to put in my albums at 5x7\" size, 8x11\" pictures print kind of grainy- but I don't use the high resolution setting on the camera.The instruction manual is easy to navigate and simple to follow, I carry it with me on vacations to review how to take panoramic photos (these print beautifully!), or how to set the red-eye reduction.One word of caution, always use the wrist-strap when handling the camera.  I dropped my camera once on vacation, photos taken after that were too dark to see.  I sent the camera back for service to Olympus, and they were fantastic!  I had the camera returned within 3 weeks, and I could track the progress of my repair online at the Olympus website.

The zoom capability is great and the pictures are really sharp.I was really concerned about battery life because I had heard that batteries get drained really quickly with digital cameras.  I've taken over 100 pictures using Rayovac rechargeable batteries and the battery meter is still on full.  I only use the LCD screen to display pictures I've taken.  I use the viewfinder when taking pictures.The only negatives are that you have to manually lift the flash when taking flash pictures and that the camera does not use USB.

My 35mm SLR (Minolta SRT201)skills transfer well to this digital for takeoff photos of aircraft.  Ignore the \"digital zoom\" rating for all cameras, as the quality comes with the optical qualities.  A couple of professional photographers in 1978 rated Minolta optics a close second to Nikon's first for SLRs, and I would place Olympus third.  In coastal Alaska, durability is the thing, as humidity rarely drops below 75%.  My D-460Z resides in a LowePro case with enough room for a spare set of NiMH AAs and SmartMedia cards.  At the time, Olympus had a special deal for a free Zio USB card reader with purchase, and I have since upgraded to an HP printer with integral card reader.  CAUTION: Do not delete photos from the card unless the card is in the camera as other card readers may corrupt the format, rendering the card worthless, until you locate the program (try google search) to reformat the card.","Date":"November 30, 2005"}

The supplied \"Camedia\" software allows for a little more than just basic editing and is similiarily easy to use. I find the fold up flash inconvenient. I sometimes forget to place it in its armed position and miss an opportunity. The switch behind the sliding cover which retracts the lens and protects the camera would be better positioned to operate a bit sooner so you would not have to be so careful to avoid hitting the lens when closing the case.The light weight and smooth compact design of the camera are real high points. When closed, it fits in a pocket or pouch without ever snagging on anything and is well protected.

Picture quality is very nice, and the camera itself is easy to use.My only gripe is the battery cover.  Because of where it is and the direction it slides (and the fact that the batteries are literally spring-loaded projectiles), it's really easy to bump or grab the camera so that the battery compartment springs open, spilling the batteries and requiring you to re-enter the time and date (if you do).  Many times I've pulled the camera out, only to fumble with getting the batteries back into it.Other than that, I love it!  Oh, and I'd recommend getting a USB reader for the memory.  I didn't think that waiting for the serial download would be that big of a deal, but it gets irksome.  A larger memory card would be a long wait.","Date":"October 8, 2001"}

It is my first digital camera. So far Its seems to be a good unit. I have found only two things to complain about; 1> - the included batteries can cause some confusion, if you follow the instruction manual, to load them. The battery polarity indicator diagram ,on the bottom of the camera, just doesn't match the polarity label on the included Olympus batteries (i.e. it looks like they load with polarity reversed..not a good thing). The manual has diagrams for loading individual AA batteries with polarity clearly indicated (which matches the diagram on the camera) but the diagram that illustrates loading the included battery packs has no polarity indicated!?!? The battery packs are 'Keyed' so you can only insert them one way. After arguing with myself over the conflicting info , I inserted the batteries, and the camera came up and works fine. Now I have to resolve this problem again when I use rechargeable individual NiMh batteries. Olympus really needs to rethink the instructions. I bet more than a few people have tried to use individual AA batteries , loaded them backwards and fried the camera. Tsk. Tsk. Major Oversight Olympus. I understand that the Olympus batteries are very expensive, perhaps Olympus concluded that a little dis-information could equal increased profits?? The Technically impaired may well resort to using only the Olympus brand in order to avoid problems??.  Compliaint #2 >It sure could use a USB port,but hey .... I guess you can't have everything.

I have tried repeatedly to get Olympus to stand behind their camera and repair it, they refuse, it is almost impossible to get ANY kind of response from their Customer Service people, if you don't believe me, check out other websites where complaints against Olympus are rampant.Save your money and get a camera with a good company name and customer service department behind it.","Date":"February 6, 2003"}

Then the tiny Canon digital camera came out.. so I sold the D-340 and bought the Canon digital camera. While it was nice and small, it didn't take the quality of pictures that the Olympus did, nor did it fit the hand right.  I sold the Canon digital camera and bought this one in January of 2001.  I also bought some rechargeable 2AA batteries at the same time and finally had to use them.  The batteries that come with the camera (lithium, I believe) JUST died this January (2002)!  I have taken hundreds of pictures with this camera! (Maybe thousands!)  Anyhow, the camera is designed to fit your hand. The size is about what a normal camera might be. If I had a bigger purse, it would probably fit.  I just bought a small digital camera bag for it. I can toss in the battery charger, etc. I like the quality of the zoom. The only thing that I don't care for is that the flash has to be flipped up in order to use it.  I guess this is good and bad.  Good because if you DON'T want to use flash for a picture, just don't flip it up (less having to do with settings, etc.). Bad, though, in case you forget to flip it up when you need the flash.

Ultimately after the camera broke I searched for a replacement, but unfortunately Olympus never followed up with anything as good. Since then I moved on to Canon, Panasonic and Nikon cameras.

It was up and running with no problem, very easy to use, great pictures.  One thing:  I did not find the flash very user friendly.  The first few times I could not remember how to use it.  You must physically pop it up, which is hard to remember after other cameras that have the flash ready to go at any time.  But surprise, it took good pictures, even without the flash, and after several tries I finally remembered I had to pop it up.  I love this camera, and look for any excuse to take a picture.

Each pack consists of two batteries sealed together in a plastic casing. Both casings fit in the camera in only one direction. At first glance it appears the polarity marks printed on the battery casings are incorrect and do not match polarity instructions inside the camera. Solution:  Print all four polarities (rather than two) on each battery pack to eliminate the confusion. Also, the battery compartment door requires TLC to close which concerns me because it's plastic.Initial comments with regard to camera options and photo quality are very favorable......and still learning.","Date":"November 3, 2000"}

The cammera does it all, but when you want to control the exposure or the WB or even the sensitivity you'll have some problems. You can't DO a White Balance, instead you have some Pre asigned items to choose, and you just have 3 different sensitivities to choose. The other problem is that you can't control the focus or the diaphragm or the shutter speed.  My mother bought this camera in the US 1 year ago and I've been taking pictures of everything I see in the street. It haves a good image quality (maybe you'll see the lights a lil bit strange when checking your pictures) and even you can shot 166 pics with the worst quality (in an 8 mb card).  I discovered that when you connect it to the Videorecorder you can record what you are seeing. So if you have the old \"porta pack\" equipment you can use it even as a CAMCODER! (forget about the sound).  The worst part of the camera is the battery consumption. I got tired of wasting lots of $ buying more and more batteries. It needs 4 AA batteries and if you use the LCD they'll last 15 minutter or something. Maybe you woun't take this to serious when you buy an item....","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

The quality of prints I get are fantastic for a 1.2 megapixel camera. I am able to get prints up to 5x7 with good color tones if the correct setting is chosen. I like that the flash is manual (it doesn't automatically pop up when it detects there isn't enough light) because it gives me a little more control. I have never had a problem with the lens cover hitting the lens when closing it. The lens cover basically is a \"two click\" close; one to activate the lens to swivel down into the base and then the next to complete the closing of the cover. The only thing I would improve this camera with is for Olympus to add more accessories in the kit. I had to go buy batteries, battery charger, larger memory card and a camera bag, which added up very quickly.","Date":"February 15, 2002"}

{"Title":"One camera that does it all","Author":"\"wavshrdr\"","ReviewID":"R3GQPNKDBPE5G","Overall":"good","Content":"I had the predecessor to this camera the 2020Z.  Great camera but I wanted audio capability.  Everything I liked about the 2020Z is here and more.  Its still compact (fits in pockets better than most), EASY on batteries,  excellent colors, fast lens (2020Z is faster), fast shot recovery, wireless  remote and very light weight.  The 3030Z expands on the 2020Z with one  lever zoom for both optical and digital modes, higher resolution (won't  gain you much on average size pictures), more control over power off and on  settings.  Some things that I do miss about the 2020Z are it's faster lens  and the ability to shot 30 frames per second in low resolution movie mode.  You do have a large memory buffer on the 3030Z so you can shoot 5 frames in  best resolution mode in a little over a second!  While no camera can yet do  it all this one comes very close.  I currently have an Olympus 2500L, 500L,  2020Z and Nikon Coolpix 950 and this is my favorite by far.  The only  things I would change on the 3030Z are: an incredibly close macro mode like  the 950/990 Nikon, standard NiMH batteries and charger like my 2020Z,  faster lens of the 2020Z (one of the fastest on a digital), 30 fps in all  movie modes as well as optical instead of digital zoom with movies and the  nifty little exposure histogram like on the high-end Nikons.  Those minor  quibbles aside it is an outstanding camera.  It doesn't eat batteries,  takes great pictures (not just great digital pictures) and is very fast  between shots and from the time your press the shutter to the shot is  actually taken.  If you have used a Kodak 280 or 290 you know how  aggravating it is to press the shutter and wait...wait... wait... until you  finally lose the once in a lifetime shot you actually wanted to take.It  is tough to go wrong if you buy this camera.  It is not cheap but it is an  excellent value.  The \"boot up\" time of the camera is really quick too. If  you are willing to trade off a slightly smaller memory buffer for burst  mode and slightly less recording time in movies as well the Olympus 3000Z  is a good choice and you will save about $200.  One big plus often  overlooked is the software that comes bundled with the camera.  The  software included with the Nikon's is basic at best.  If you buy the 3030Z  you get Adobe Photoshop 5 LE which is an outstanding program that gives you  a lot of control over editing your images.  It may be the \"light\" version  of Photoshop but it is still incredibly powerful. This does NOT come with  the 3000Z though!  I think that is part of the pricing difference between  the two.  One other big plus about the Olmpus \"C\" series in general is that  you rarely get \"red eye\" when using the built in flash.  I can't seem to  avoid it on my Nikon 950 and my friend has the same problem on his Nikon  990.  The 3030Z does a great job in low light conditions without the flash  too.  Buy one, it's a great camera!","Date":"June 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"IMPRESSED!","Author":"Andre L. Aragon","ReviewID":"R2NQEAVINA1H02","Overall":"good","Content":"Being a tech geek, I did a bit of research on the various websites and narrowed my choices between the Olympus 3030 and Nikon 9090.  It seemed to be a toss up depending on which features you valued most.  I chose the Olympus for a variety of reasons and haven't regretted my decision.  First of all, the picture quality exceeded my expectations from the very first picture.  I've taken a variety of shots from the different settings and even with the \"avereage\" quality setting of images, the detail the camera picked up is unbelievable.  I've even zoomed in on the images with various photo editing programs and still can't detect any distortion.  Secondly, the installation of the provided software was a easy.  A nice bonus to the software was the supplying of Adobe Photoshop 5.0 LE, a slimmed down version of the very popular photo editing program that sets the industry standard for professional photo editing.  Third, Olympus provided a USB cable for downloading images from the camera to the PC, which speeds up the process tremendously when comparing it to a Serial transfer.  The few complaints I have concern more of the decisions of Olympus for what they provided instead of the overall quality of the camera.  First, why in the heck didn't they provide a charger and rechargable batteries?  Sure, they upgraded to Lithium batteries but this camera eats a lot of juice when using the LCD monitor.  And how about providing an AC adaptor for those times we want to download all our images or use the camera indoors.  Second, I had to go out and purchase a little lens cap strap since the cap isn't connected to the camera.  Having to place the cap in and out of my pocket when I want to take pictures is asking for the cap to be lost (especially when making the family trips to Disneyland).Finally, the Olympus also uses the Smartmedia data storage and provides you with a 16MB card.  This isn't bad depending on what setting you have your camera on (the higher the quality, the less pictures you can take) but I would consider purchasing an additional memory card with a higher capacity.  As of this date, I believe the highest amount of MB that Smartmedia makes is 64Mb.  I know the Nikon uses the Compact Flash system and can go a as high as 128MB.  That's a feature to consider (well, the cost for a 128MB Compact Flash card runs on average is about $300).","Date":"December 8, 2000"}

I agree with Jim DuLaney on the  shutter delay of digital cameras.  I am use to the release on my Canon F-1 and A-1.  However, you can shoot again while the camera is still recording the image to the SmartMedia Card.PLEASE NOTE:  \"Slopedirk\" (see his review) must not have used the owner's manual.  You most certainly can set your own default settings, such as your preferred resolution; whether you want flash or no flash; shutter priority or aperture priority, and the preferred setting; etc.The menu selections are fairly simple once you play with the camera awhile.  As for the problem of taking the lens cap off before turning on the power - buy the extender tube (an Olympus accessory).  This tube is needed if you attach accessory lenses.  I find it very useful because it allows me to use a filter (Haze, UV, Skylight, etc.).  I leave it on at all times!A good companion book for any digital camera: Digital Photography For Dummies, by Julie Adair(find it at [amazon])...

In the end, I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature. (I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family.) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures. Family picture takers will like this camera. It takes great pictures, easy to transfer using USB, and comes bundled with great software. The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible. It is relatively easy to use, but I have not mastered making quick changes yet. A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor. Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes. You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features. They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user...If you are buying this camera, you should also get extra memory and batteries. You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter. I haven't tried rechargeables yet, but that may be my next purchase.","Date":"December 10, 2000"}

I can override the  shutter speed, the aperture or both and get the same effects as with my old  manual Nikon -- and do it in color, sepia, or black and white.  What's  more, the flash is versitile and easy to switch off for ambient light work  -- and even the fully automatic settings turn out some fine exposures.  It self corrects for florescent, tungsten, shade or sun -- it zooms  tight for close ups without requiring lots of extra lens purchases up front  -- it gives me enough flexibility in dpi / resolution that I can shoot 40  or 300 frames on a single disk -- and it's easy to download into my little  Mac iBook thanks to the included software -- it does everything I would  have on my wish list if I were making up this camera myself....No  problems.

Windows 95 users will need to purchase a floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to a PC. A Serial Port Cable also works with Windows95. I had a Sony FD-91 Mavaca Digital before I bought this Olympus and the C-3030 has the Mavaca beat hands down.

It allows for many pixel  compressions of jpeg files, all of which are fine quality.  In the 1st 3  weeks, I have taken over 1,000 photos of nature, travel, people, and  objects.  It uses smartcards which are smaller than a matchbook cover and  the 32 meg smartcard allows 330 photos on the SQ2 down to 40 on the HQ  compression. I print on a Hewlett-Packard Office Jet 60R and the quality is  very close to 35mm enlargements from a color lab. I recommend using the  rechargeable batteries since they last many hours then take a quick  recharge. I intend to use this camera to photograph mushrooms in our  forests this August and have total confidence in it. The macro button  allows the lens to be within inches of the subject, and with both manual  and digital zoom enabled, the subject fills the view.  The lens is fast  enough to use in dim light, but the flash is there when you need it.  The  accompanying software is easy to install, easy to use.Caveats: it is  very complex and the accompanying manual is essential. I refer to the  manual daily.  Also, I find it hard to get accustomed to the shutter delay  of a digital cameras after using a Canon A-1 SLR for all these years.  I  should mention that  the 1 1/2 inch LCD monitor cannot be seen when in  direct sunlight, although is perfectly visible when in shadows.  The  biggest flaw is the lens cap which MUST be removed before power is turned  on, and CANNOT be in place while power is on, a very odd flaw, Olympus.","Date":"August 1, 2000"}

With it, I've taken great shots of daily scenes in and around Miami, FL.  Having it makes street photography fun and easy.As for the C3030's image quality, no other digital camera, in its price range, outdoes it. I went from a One Megapixel camera straight to the C3030.  Needless to say, the difference was astounding.  The large number of resolutions from which to choose really allow the photographer to shoot for any purpose--from email attachments, to Web pages, to professionally output hi-res images.  Usually, simply using the default resolution with the built in picture taking modes is right for any situation not requiring super hi-res output.  And it's easy.I coupled my Olympus with an HP DeskJet 1220C.  Using the camera's default resolution, the printed output is guite good.  I can tell I haven't used the higher resolutions.  But my friends, who see the framed photos, usually think they came from a lab.Of course I use Photoshop to help tweak the images until they look just as I want them to look.  But I really don't need to.All in all, the C3030 is an excellent Camera.  The number of settings and menus is, at first, a bit daunting.

{"Title":"Serious photographers will love this camera!","Author":"Tool Connoisseur","ReviewID":"R3KLJOVBOCQWV9","Overall":"good","Content":"This is an outstanding camera.  I have been a casual photographer for many years and finally took the digital plunge - the C3030 outstrips the performance of my 35 mm SLR, and after much research, I concluded it outperforms most digital cameras as well.  I also read some of the previous reviews, and most of the negative \"problems\" people listed either weren't problems of the camera or were because the person didn't know how to use the camera. When it comes right down to it, picture quality is what makes or breaks a digital camera.  The C3030 sweeps the field.  Color quality and sharpness exceeds my 35 mm.  I took a face portrait of my son and blew it up to just his eyeball - you could count the tiny veins in his eye.  You can easily blow up pictures beyond 8 x 10 and still have sharp pictures.  It does a better job reproducing sharp, realistic colors than most Kodak film.  Low light capability is very good (even better with the new C3040 with its 1.8 lens).  The menu is easily navigated (although it will take a little study of the manual; the camera has a lot of capability) and the controls are, for the most part, very easy to use.  The camera is nicely programmable for those who want to venture there.  The memory-buffered multi-picture capability (like a fast motor drive in an SLR) is very handy for action shots.  The camera is extremely compact considering its capability and can be carried easily.  When taking pictures, it is very comfortable and natural to hold, unlike many other digital cameras. The USB transfer rate is much better than a serial cable but I took it a step further and bought an inexpensive Smart Media PC card adaptor.  I pop the card out of the camera and into the PC slot and it is a near instant download of 128 MB of pictures! (I purchased the 128 MB card and it holds a huge number of pictures). It uses up batteries, but no more than other digital cameras.  I purchased 1400mah NiMH batteries and travel charger for only $38 - it works great and lasts a reasonable amount of time; hasn't been a problem. I have taken many hundreds of pictures, perhaps thousands, without a single glitch.  One of my few complaints is the flash performance, but the camera takes such great pictures without the flash, especially with a tripod, I mostly don't use it.  Again, the new C3040 may take this even one step further.  I also wish the Macro performance was better (closer) but it has been acceptable for most applications.  My next purchase will be the telephoto lens to expand the camera's capabilities. Bottom line is you will love this camera.","Date":"March 22, 2001"}

It takes good pictures in a variety of lighting situations. It has two problems; the first is that darn lens cap gets lost easily, the second is that the view through the viewfinder (not the LCD display) doesn't accurately represent the frame. Both can be solved (one with an elastic cord glued to the camera and one with practice) but they detract from an otherwise excellent product. I also like the ability to record a short audio segment on each picture, this is enough to describe the scene so that I can remember it later (try to remember everyone at your wedding for example!)","Date":"October 28, 2000"}

If your an expert photographer and  are looking for a high-end digital camera that you can manipulate the  shutter speed, film speed or aperature as well as a wide variety of special  effects, this is your camera.The 3030 has a very easy to use menu for  selecting all of your options, and you don't need a masters degree to  understand and operate it.  The camera is also very good on batteries!  I  personally use rechargable AA batteries and I have never had a problem.  another nice feature is the USB port, you can download your photos  ultra-fast from your camera to your computer.  The manual is very easy to  understand, I had no problems interpreting the instructions.  My only  complaint about the camera is the lens cap.  It can be easily lost as it  has no retention straps.  Also the lens zooms out upon turning on the  power, and you have better removed the lens cap first or risk stripping out  the gears in the lens.  But this is a minor issue. This camera also comes  with a 16meg memory card (most cameras come with 8meg) but I would  recommend the 32meg card, nothing worse than running out of memory!If  you are looking for a high-end camera and don't mind shelling out about  $800, I would really consider this camera.","Date":"July 14, 2000"}

But I went ahead and bought it, only to discover that the problems didn't exist.It is extremely easy to turn off the flash (just a touch of the obvious button with a flash sign on it), and the Ni-MH batteries that come with the accessory package work just swell.  I was also astonished at how long the batteries that came with the camera lasted and lasted and lasted.  Not a single problem transferring the pics to the puter, either.  I agree that more f-stops could come in handy, but the speed of the lens has worked terrific for me.  Shooting at 2.4 covers a lot of territory, and a lens like that for my Canon would cost me a fortune.  Come to think of it, it has cost me a fortune.  I find myself opting to underexpose shots (when the choice has to be made) because I can always recover a good deal of the \"lost info\" through Photoshop.  But once it's blow out, it's out.  I have to say that going back and reading some of these reviews, now that I have the camera, I'm wondering if I have the same camera as some of these other people:-)All of the good points about this camera have pretty much been covered, so I won't spend time going over them.  I just want to put in my rave about how small it is, the angles available on the lens, and the mind-blowing prints that come out of my Epson 1270 printer.  The tonal range of the colors is so broad (much broader than I've been able to capture on silver halide) that I sometimes put a file through Adobe first, just to bring it down to what is usually expected.  I was very nervous when I bought this camera, thinking that the time for me to own a digital really hadn't come yet, but I was delightfully wrong about that.  Even if I weren't relying on this for professional reasons, I'd want it just for keeping family memories.  It is such a delight to be in a \"junk in, junk out\" photo enviornment, and not biting my nails until I'm in the darkroom to see if I caught what I thought I was catching.","Date":"February 6, 2001"}

There are only someminors things you should be aware off: 1. As pointed out below, thelens cap does seem to have a precarious life without a strap, but youcan get one... at any camera store.  2. The 16MB smartcard that comeswith it, will only last you for 20 high resolution pictures, so Idefinitely recommend you invest in a 64MB card as soon as you purchasethe camera . 3.  The viewfinder displays about 20% less of the pictureof what you will actually take, depending on the zoom value, which canbe annoying when you want to make good framing. But I think this isendemic in non SLR cameras.4. My camera for some reason refused toturn on after a week of using it.

The first one was putting bright speckles on all its pictures, so I quickly exchanged it for another one. Thie second one worked fine (only one bright speckle, always in the same place) for a few hundred pictures, but now it refuses to erase or reformat its Smartmedia cards. I have three cards, with only a few images on each one at the moment, and the camera will neither erase nor reformat any of them any more. Nor will it take any more pictures on any card--it squeals and displays \"Card Full!\" on its LCD. I've tried different sets of batteries, leaving the batteries out for awhile (hoping it will reset itself, or something), and everything else I can think of. The troubleshooting section of the manual says nothing of this problem. So I don't know what to do now, except to send the camera back for warranty repairs. The pictures this camera takes are excellent when it works, excluding the little speckles, but I'm pretty disappointed in it otherwise. For a thousand dollars, it should be more reliable than this.","Date":"November 14, 2000"}

The FD-91 is good but the C-3030 is the best by far when it comes to photo print quality. You can hardly tell the difference between a print from this camera or a good 35mm slr camera. Although the camera is complicated to operate, once you read the very large operating manual it gets easier to operate. Be aware that this camera is only USB compatable when you have Windows98 and not the upgrade. If you have Windows95 you will have to buy the floppy disc adapter for the smart media card in order to download pictures to your PC. A serial port cable also works with Windows95. An optional 32MB media card is also a plus. If you have a good ink jet printer and want some excellent photos, then the Olympus C-3030 is worth the premium price you will pay for this feature loaded camera.","Date":"October 23, 2000"}

I researched extensively the cameras available and found that the C3030 is certainly one of the best for the bucks. The only negative thing about the camera is it's time delay between clicking the button and it taking the picture. So if you do a ton of action shots you may want to do some more research. My former Mavicas were instantaneous. Otherwise a great camera. The only negatives I have aren't the camera as much as Olympus... A. Camera lens cover comes off when you look at it wrong. I lost mine in the first week and still have'nt been able to find a relplacement. Get a $2.00 lens cord and you'll be spared this problem. B. Buy more than the 16mb flash card. Unless you shoot just a few pictures and download religiously, you'll want more memory. C. Don't use the LCD panel display unless you own stock in Duracell. Use the SLR through the lens viewer and save a ton on batteries. D. Forget the packaged software provided. Buy a Viking flash reader or just download on to your computer and use a real photo editing program...and if you use Windows 2000 don't even try to load the software.Overall a great camera with great quality images.","Date":"April 29, 2001"}

With both cameras, many indoor shots had be be \"doctored\" in Adobe Photoshop.  Levels need to be adjusted and then the photos are just great. Outdoor shots are great.  I did notice that battery life with the 3030 was considerably more than that of the 460. Rechargeable batteries are essential with any digital camera!  I really like the \"movie with sound\" function of the 3030.  Smart media reader buyers - beware if you have an AMD processor.  After much research I have found that a Pentium processor is essential and your reader may not work with an AMD. Camera appearance very professional looking.  For the true photographer, this camera is a must.  For the amateur the 460 works quite nicely.","Date":"October 16, 2000"}

One person commented that it took him 15 minutes  to figure out the camera battery flap which he ended up breaking.  Without  reading the manual it took me no time at all to install 4 AA batteries and  I had the camera up and running immediately without a hitch - or breaking  anything.  There was nothing wrong with my remote control or the battery,  and camera view finder works as it should.  The one very minor flaw is that  if you power up the camera with the lens cap over the lens, the zoom lens  tries to push outward causing the a grinding sound.  Its happend to me a  couple times but didn't cause any damage and I'm more careful now to take  the lens cap off before powering up the camera.  This camera is awesome!

Much of my photography is done with a tripod and a hand held light meter and this camera allows me manual exposure control.  This and manual focus allows me to control the depth of field.  The only real drag is that there isn't a way to preview the depth of field.  I also purchased this camera because you can use an off-camera flash, but unfortunately, unlike the earlier models (c-2000 and c-2020) that used a regular pc socket, this camera has a special socket for use with a very expensive Olympus flash.

I have noticed that I take many more pictures than I used to and have the ability to immediatly share them with family and friends via e-mail.  If you are in the market for a digital camera there are a couple of things you should look for: 2 megapixal or higher, pick a camera from a company that makes good optics (Nikon, Olympus, minolta, etc.),durability and ease of use.  This camera excels in all of those catagories.  The instruction book that came with the camera fully explained all of the features.  This camera also will let you control the shutter and aperature settings, this is a must for creating some special effects.  During this past year I have no complaints or problems with the camera.  Now that a year has passed I ask myself would I still buy this camera. Answer:no.  I found that I really could use a zoom, this camera only has a 3 power zoom.  The Olympus C-2100 has a 10 power zoom.  My friend bought one last month and I noticed how much more they got out of their camera.  So if you think you will need a zoom for that special wildlife photo take a look at the Olympus C-2100.  To sumerize: this camera is a very well built and reliable.

This means you can take color corrected pictures in a Gym, out doors, when clouds come out and indoors with incadencent lights.  It even does moview with sound.  Has many features my 35mm had too so I can take custom pictures.  Buy this camera, it is fun, easy to hold, and carry.  To make this work well I recommend buying these with it at the time of purchase: The olympus 64 meg scan disk not any other manuf.  You can do panormic only with oly.  Buy 8 Rechardable Energizer batteris high energy nic-net-hydride and charger, The olypus CLA1 41mm to 43mm conversion lens adapter, at 24.95 and the step uup ring 43 mm to 55mm , then get a 55mm UV haze filter and 55mm lens cap.

A knob would be a  much better way to handle this and some other settings.  I also personally  am a retro guy and would lose the motorized stuff, a nice lever would  suffice and save the batteries.  Same thing for flash, it goes off unless  you turn it off via a menu, and that can ruin a natual light picture if you  forget.  Too much automatic stuff for me to really feel \"as one\"  with this thing, but it does take outstanding pictures.The pictures are  very good with this camera.  Software good, and with a big memory chip it  holds tons of pictures.

It works well with the Viking 128MB chip (other than inability to do panorama, not much of a drawback for me) and right out of the box I was able to quickly be pointing and shooting. This is my second digital camera, and I am very impressed with it. The LCD menus are a little tricky to navigate at first, but I am quickly learning where things are. I have experimented with taking pictures at different resolutions and qualities, and also shot some movie clips. I downloaded the results to my computer with little trouble, although I think I would recommend buying either a reader or a PCMCIA adapter for the memory chip, downloading from the camera over it's USB port to the hard drive is a little cumbersome. It takes very nice photos in average lighting without the need for the flash, and I find it very easy to quickly snap a picture, especially of quickly moving subjects like children. It took me a little reading of the manual to discover that the remote only works when the timer is enabled, however once I mastered it I like the 3 second delay so you can hide the remote. I like the ergonomic placement of the controls, I can both hold the camera and work its major functions with a single hand. I didn't see any mention in the manual of the fact that the lens cap has to be removed prior to turning it since the first thing it tries to do is extend the lens barrel. Perhaps the lens cap should snap onto the extensible barrel and not the external housing? These are not major drawbacks but things to bear in mind while learning to use this camera. As a prior user of a digital camera, I think Olympus has done a good job addressing some of the shortcomings of early digital cameras, plus creating a digital camera that looks and feels like the film cameras I have used for years. The touch of the shutter button, picture resolution and recording speed are vastly superior to what I am used to in a digital camera, and compare with a good SLR. All the additional features are there if I want them, but the solid performance of the basic function is a key ingredient. I like to tinker, and having numerous overrides is great, but sometimes I am glad to not to bother with them and just click away, knowing the automatic program is making the right choices for me.","Date":"June 21, 2001"}

I'm amazed by the quality of the pictures that this camera takes.  Even in extremely low light circumstances, I can turn of the flash and get beautiful natural light pictures.  I can only imagine what the F 1.8 lens on the new 3040 model would do!  The menu is easy to use and the camera is delighlfully small.  Manual settings are easy to adjust, but the auto setting mode is dead-on except for difficult shots like those with backlighting.  The video mode also works great and captures both video and sound for short periods (200 seconds on a 64 mb card at HQ resolution).  This is a great camera and the price is also great.

This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it. ... My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter. ... The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those free.  The lens cleaning kit is handy.","Date":"May 26, 2001"}

If all digital cameras produce images of this quality, I don't see why everyone is waiting to get their first digital camera.The problems that I have with this camera include:The size of the camera is much larger than many other digital cameras on the market.  It is also larger than most current consumer-targeted 35mm and APS cameras.  It is not as large as a 35mm SLR camera however.The lense cap on this camera does not have a strap.  This is a problem that is compounded by the fact that the lense cap falls off relatively easily when pressure is applied to it.  A replacement cap with a strap can be purchased from Olympus. My only other comment is that the camera delays a split-second or so after pressing the shutter button before the image is taken.  This makes the camera very impractical for shooting anything in which a lot of action is involved.  You will likely miss the shot you intended to take.  I do not regularly take these types of pictures, however, so it isn't much of an issue.Overall, I really like the camera.  My replacement cap fixes the strap issue, and I regularly travel with a backpack when I take my camera, so the size isn't a problem.

The more expensive non-rechargable Lithiums like it comes with last a very long time.  Great picts too!Customer service at Olympus however is EXTREMELY POOR!  I tried to call them regarding their recommended batteries not working (camera goes dead immediately - low batteries).  I was on hold (Daytime long distance rates!) for over an hour pushing a button every minute or so.  I finally hung up after listening to them tell me how valuable my time was.  So,I tried E-mail.  Got a great generic answer but not about my question.  So, I tried their web site.  It said Ni-MH batteries of 1300 mA or better work.  Mine are 1500 mA and don't.  So, I tried a response to their E-mail.  Yet another useless response that didn't even approach answering my question.  I tried to call them again and got the same crappy treatment again and hung up.  I tried E-mail again and got yet another useless response.The bottom line is that I'll use the $10 each lithium batteries since I get about 250 shots from them.  I won't even attempt to use their support again.  Don't waste your time.  I really like the camera and its a shame that a company that makes such great products can't get a support department that can read or staffed to handle the volume of calls they must be getting.  Its no wonder they don't have a 1-800 number for support!","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

I use it with rechargable batteries and keep it set for 2 megapixel pictures and great great battery life and it allows me to take 80 pictures on a memory card.I often use this with external lights and after a day of messing around with settings (the manual doesn't help much) found I needed to buy a special flash cabel to connect to my studio lights.  The cable allows me to override the internal flash and take very good pictures of kids.  I had to go to a professional photo store in Palo Alto to get the cable (could not find it on the Web) for about $30.I rarely use my 35 mm cameras anymore and use this one almost exclusively.

It was my replacement for the D600L from Olympus.Negatives:  not many.  My biggest pet peeve is the battery low indicator is not as accurate as I'd like.  The camera actually begins to lose functionality long before low battery is displayed.  And the camera goes downhill very quickly.  But the symptoms are more like the camera has lost some functionality and not others (inability to zoom but still able to focus).  I've just become used to replacing the battteries as soon as I start having any strange issues.Its not as small as I'd like.  The D200L was a great size for a camera.  This one is still too big for my liking.

The pictures are sometimes great and sometimes not so great, and photoshop is fairly limiting. Resolution is of course very good, I use it on lower resolution for personal pictures and high resolution for digital analysis of marine pictures (with optimas software). Any possible marine housing would be extremely expensive, and I am sometimes worried about the camera dying from wave spray or rain. If I had it to do over again I think I would spend the extra $... and get a 3040 with the new \"brighter\" lens, or a sony camera with bright pictures and cheap housing.

This has been a fantastic camera both in terms of quality, reliability and battery life.  Between some friends and myself we have just about every model in this family (C-2000 through C-3040) and we all love our cameras.Quality: I have taken hundreds of shots, mostly outdoor.  I tend to shoot at the high-quality jpeg level so I bought a 64MB smart media card.  Paired with my HP DeskJet 952 I regularly printout 4x6 prints on photo paper that are absolutely perfect.  I have printed a few 8x10 pictures and they are fantastic.  No one can believe they were taken with a digital camera.  I have to zoom in quite a ways with my photo editing software before I can see any pixels.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish it had a better macro mode.Reliability: It has been rained on, splashed by a wave, and dropped a short distance onto a rock.  Despite all this it is still going strong a year and several hundred pictures later with no negative affects.Batteries: I use the rechargeable batteries and during heavy use they last 2-3 weeks.  During light use they last 3-6 months.  Compare this to most Kodak or Nikon cameras that last a few days of heavy use.A few comments on my accessories: Forget the 16MB card that comes with it.  I keep only mine as a back up.  You will want a 64 MB smart media card.I bought the Olympus T-CON14 tele-converter lens 1.45x (152mm equivalent) and I am very happy with it.  It can retail up to $200 but I shopped around on-line.  My next purchase is the wide-angle lens.I bought the Olympus Accessory Kit (which is the same for C-2000 through C-3040 models), mostly for the UV filter, adapter tube and 43mm-55mm step-up ring, and AC adapter.  I bought it for about $95, which is close to what all those things cost separate.  The mini-tripod, software, and case that come in that kit are not overly impressive but I considered those `free'.

{"Title":"Arguably the best 3.3 megapixel camera on the market","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R14G9LYPR6UX1S","Overall":"good","Content":"If you're looking for a 3.3 megapixel camera, you'll probably end up choosing from among the Olympus C-3030Z, the Nikon Coolpix 990, Sony DSC-S70 and the Canon PowerShot S70.  All are great products.  After  extensive research, I decided on the Olympus C-3030Z.I suppose the  primary thing to look for in any camera, analog or digital, is image  quality.  In this regard, all of these cameras score very well.  People  seem to say that the Sony produces the sharpest pictures with the most  vivid -- but not necessarily most accurate -- color; the Canon's images are  good but tend to be on the \"cool\" side; and the Nikon and Olympus  are said to produce the most balanced and \"accurate\" images.  It  is hard to say which camera takes the \"best\" pictures: some  people prefer the razor-sharp look of the Sony images, while others find  the Olympus and Nikon images much more pleasing -- it's all a matter of  taste.  But basically, you are going to get superb pictures from any of  these cameras.  Personally, I thought the Olympus and Nikon produced the  most natural-looking and visually appealing images.Image quality aside,  there are basically 3 reasons I chose the Olympus.  FIRST, it has a solid,  rugged feel and its black aluminum body fits naturally into your hand.  (The Coolpix's twist body is, well, cool -- but I found it awkward to hold,  and the Olympus is more compact.)  SECOND, the Olympus uses the tiny  \"SmartMedia\" flash memory card, which I prefer, simply because I  have another device that uses the same format.  (The Sony uses its  proprietary \"Memory Stick\"; the Nikon uses CompactFlash Type I;  and the Canon takes CompactFlash Type I/II, I think.)  THIRD, the Olympus  provides a large number of image resolution storage modes -- you can choose  any combination of picture size (2048x1536, 1600x1200, 1280x960,1024x768,  640x480) and compression level (uncompressed TIFF, jpeg high quality, jpeg  normal), for a total of 15 different combinations.  This flexibility  enables you to choose the resolution/compression appropriate to your  particular intended use of the images.  (By the way, you can fit about 20  images at 2048x1536, normal jpeg compression onto the supplied 16MB  SmartMedia card.)  FOURTH, the Olympus is very fast: quick power-up, very  little shutter \"lag\", and large memory buffer that makes a  \"burst\" or sequence mode possible.  FIFTH, the camera allows you  to make short (up to 3 minutes) movies, with audio.I've had the camera  for about a week now, and I love it.  The pictures are astonishingly good,  and the camera has an intuitive menu system that makes it easy to use.  The  USB connection is a snap, although I use a SmartMedia card reader to  download pix to my computer.  A nice touch: the camera comes with an A/V  cable and a little wireless remote so you can hook it up to your TV, gather  everyone around and gawk at the pictures you just took!All in all, I  feel I made the right choice with the Olympus.  My only criticisms: Olympus  should package this camera with rechargeable NiMH batteries, not the  lithium disposables it comes with; the LCD screen has a bit of a glare  problem in the outdoors; and the optical zoom isn't integrated with the  digital zoom (i.e., the camera doesn't automatically transition to digital  zoom when optical zoom \"runs out\") -- you have to access a menu  to switch from one to the other.  But these are very minor gripes.  I  recommend the Olympus C-3030Z without hesitation!","Date":"July 12, 2000"}

Now this is something, the 135mm, nor i think the medium format can give. BTW, I used the SHQ format, which gives me abt 27 pic, on a 64 MB disk.However, MANY problems were encountered when we were trying to retrieve the pics from the disk. We had specially bought a cable for the transfer of info, but, it seems that, the disk, or the cable is not very stable.

As during the shoot, when i try to take my model in low light situations, there is NO way i could turn the flash off, as it does not come with that feature, as it is either  in Flash mode or hotshoe to the lightings flash.But overall, it gives gd results for a casual photographer.","Date":"January 8, 2001"}

From a beginner's perspective, this being my first digital camera, so far I'm not so impressed.There's a noticeable lag between when I click the \"shutter\" button, and the picture is actually taken.  With small children, that delay is somewhat irritating.Also, the USB drivers do not work with Windows 95.  Amazon's technical description, and Olympus's own web site, claim Windows 95 compatability, but that's only for the serial cable, which isn't included.  And apparently, upgrading to a newer Windows won't help - it must be Windows 98/Me originally installed by the manufacturer.  I'm currently exploring buying a USB SmartMedia card reader, since that would be alot cheaper than buying a whole new PC.","Date":"June 15, 2001"}
{"Title":"Olympus doesn't support TWAIN anymore !","Author":"M. R. Schuppenhauer \"swissmickey\"","ReviewID":"R2U7GHLN56DSXU","Overall":"good","Content":"One of the major issues around Olympus digital imaging systems is, that they keep ignoring TWAIN as a standard for digital imaging. We had the C-21 and returned it because of the lack of support for W2K and Twain (i.e. no direct picture transfer into W2K or PhotoShop). Reading the reviews this is a general problem for all Olympus cameras except the E-10. Olympus does not intend to fix this. The consequence is that you need to buy additional transfer equipment, use additional software spending extra money and time on getting things achieved. Your option is thus the Nikon and Canon (S-20).","Date":"December 30, 2000"}

It took me 15 minutes (and I know  my way around cameras) to put the lithium batteries in without breaking the  very difficult to use, very plastic, very breakable battery cover with a  plastic hinge!  I did not break it on the first day but I was certain that  it would break at very short point in the future and that I would be stuck  with a high end, expensive camera that would have to repaired (4-6 week  wait usually).

{"Title":"Overpiced low quality plastic toy.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"ROJKBQ95YJOBW","Overall":"bad","Content":"The first thing that struck me when I opened the camera box was the cheap quality of the plastic body of the camera and many of its functional components. The camera looks and feels cheap. There is a small motor inside that control the lens. It kept grinding like a McDonald's give away toy car. The second thing that one notices when tries to shoot a picture is the extremely poor optical quality of the optical viewfinder. I have seen better quality optical viewfinders in disposable film cameras. The Olympus spents quite a lot of effort to warn the buyer that the optical viewfinder is misaligned with respect to the actual picture taken but makes no mention of the optical quality problems.Reading the camera manual the new buyer will be \"thriled\" to learn directly from OLYMPUS that the camera TFT screen and the the LCD displays have \"limited life\". The note in the manual further warns the buyer to expect that the screen will eventualy start flickering and getting darker. So if your camera starts flickering after the warranty runs out be prepared for an expensive repair bill. It would have been nice if Olympus had put a longer lasting screen instead of warning of the shody quality of the components on the last pages of the operator's manual. If you plan to use this camera for more than a week in a field environment buy another camera. The operating specification limits in the manual specify operating and storing condition of the camera to 90% humidity. (Most other electronics specify 98% non condensing limits) So dont plan to take any picture on a hot humid summer in this continent. Overall I have to give this camera one star as Amazon does not allow dark holes in its rating system.","Date":"May 5, 2001"}

{"Title":"Great camera, with one major flaw....","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RIZGFA5XCPVZU","Overall":"good","Content":"My needs in a digital camera were simple, or so I thought. I take a lot of photos, 10-15 or more rolls at a time, which can get very expensive when you take into account the cost of film, developing and printing. It is also  time consuming, as I scan the best ones and print them out as 8 x 10s. Not  to mention a pain, carrying lots of film, lenses, filters, etc. around with  me. My aim was to save money and time, but I didn't want to sacrifice  quality, either.The Nikon Coolpix 990 takes excellent photos, and 8x10s  print very nicely. I added a $400 flash card and that has plenty of room  for lots of pictures (about 80 at fine quality), as poor shots can be  deleted immediately. Downloading the pictures to my laptop is a breeze with  the included usb cable (another review said that cut and paste doesn't  work, but it works fine for me). It's rather heavy on batteries, but once I  switched to rechargeable AAs there was a big improvement. One plus digital  cameras have over film is being able to adapt to current lighting  conditions - no fiddling with filters if taking photos indoors without a  flash, for example. So far, I was very pleased.The major flaw, for me,  came when I used the optional 2X lens (bought at the same time as the  camera). Nowhere in the literature I read before I bought the camera did it  mention that attaching the lens disables the flash. You can't even use an  external flash with it. I take many shots in poor light and at a distance,  and this renders the camera unusable in those circumstances as I am often  also unable to use a tripod. I was more than a little annoyed to find that  after spending close to $2000 total, I still had to take my 35mm camera  with me. I don't know if this is peculiar to the Nikon or common among  digital cameras, but I didn't see it mentioned anywhere.Despite this, I  am pleased with the camera, and would recommend it, especially if most of  your photos are taken outdoors or in bright indoor lighting. On my last  trip I shot only two rolls of 35mm film. At this rate the camera will have  paid for itself within the year in film and film developing savings, and  it's worth its weight in gold for the time I save on scanning and  retouching photos.","Date":"June 3, 2000"}
{"Title":"My unbiased opinion on this camera","Author":"Bobbity","ReviewID":"R1RIW454S3GQWC","Overall":"good","Content":"First off, let me say that this camera is incredible, and worth every penny.  I've owned mine for about a week, and I've taken some incredible photos that look like they came out of a magazine (and I'm an amateur at best).Now, let's get realistic about the camera.  I want to provide enough factual information to allow people to make their decisions about whether or not this is the right camera for them.  TheCoolpix 990 has tons of great points.  Most notably, it's 3.34 megapixels (3.24 effective), and thus produces top-quality images with incredible sharpness.  Another thing that was had me sold was the fact that you can go into full manual mode with this camera.  You can choose either shutter priority, aperture priority, or full manual (including fully manual focus).  This aspect of the camera should appeal to the professional or \"artsy\" photographer who wishes to customize the camera to get the exact effect they want.After you upgrade the firmware to v1.1, the speed of certain camera operations are a bit faster, but the camera is already originally very fast.  Reviewing photographs in \"Play\" mode is a breeze, and there's not much delay when paging through them.Buy rechargeable NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries and a charger before your camera ships.  The alkaline batteries that ship with the camera will die within hours,guaranteed.  Also, grab the amazing Maha C204F charger.  It allows you to leave the charger plugged in with batteries in it indefinitely, without ruining the batteries at all.  The charger will save you several hundred dollars in batteries.A few drawbacks about the 990 (yes, they do exist): BSS (best shot selection) feature is kind of weak.  It's supposed to let you take 10 shots and it chooses the best (\"the one with the most detail\" I believe the manual says, whatever that means).  On some occasions it has actually chosen blurry photos over the sharp ones.  I've no clue how this works, but Nikon needs to reevaluate this function.  And a warning: don't rely on this camera for good long-exposure shots.  Shutter times of 4 seconds and longer in a dark setting will sometimes show a lot of noise in the photograph.  This is a very noisy camera (audibly and graphically), so try to limit your exposure times.  Also, please note that you will NOT be able to access the \"info.txt\" file that people in other reviews have mentioned.  Yes, the camera saves all photo details (shutter speed, ISO, flash, aperture, etc.) to a file called \"info.txt\", but you CANNOT access the file unless you're using a card reader.  The NikonView software will only let you pull photos from the camera, nothing else.I'll conclude this here because I could rant on for a while on other great points.  The camera is truly amazing, buy it now.  Yes, it has drawbacks, but no camera is perfect--and this one comes pretty close to perfection.  This camera is comparable to the Olympus C3030, so check that out as well.  The features of the C3030 are similar, and in some ways the camera is a little better (the movie mode actually records audio!), and a little worse (uses SmartMedia only).","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

(Gadget junkies can safely ignore this post.)Let me start by saying that this is a great camera.  For my  purposes the 3M pixel resolution is as good as film.  But if you are just  moving over from a 35mm for the first time you are in a for a few rude  surprises.  Some which are endemic to all digital cameras, some Nikon 990  flaws.1. The built in flash is worse than useless for indoor portraits.  The redeye problem is horrendous and unsolvable with the built-in flash.  You'll find yourself buying an external flash (~$150)and bracket (~$50).  Why they didn't put a hotshoe on the camera is beyond me.2. If you  bought the camera for it's 3m pixel resolution you will find the 16M card  supplied as useful as a 16M Windows machine.  You need at least one 128M  card (~$250) which holds ~80 pictures (unless you plan to tether yourself  to a computer.)3. The LCD display and autofocus eat Alkaline batteries  for lunch.  You'll go through a set every 1.5 hours. At minimum you need  rechargable NiCad's.  If you're going to be outdoors for awhile consider a  rechargable external Nicad pack (~$50)4. Shutter lag time seem a lot  longer (worse) than 35mm cameras. About 1 1/2 seconds from when you push  the shutter to when the camera goes \"click\" in auto mode.  Ouch.5. If you are used to \"motor drive\" on your 35mm this  camera will drive you crazy.  There is a 1.5 second delay between photos  for the first two photos and 7 (yes seven!) seconds for the following one.  You simply cannot shoot a series of \"action\" pictures at high  res.6. Oh, hope you didn't expect a carrying case when you bought your  camera.  It's ok because once you buy the external flash and bracket you  need a larger one anyway.7. Getting pictures into your PC via the  compact flash cards are a no brainer if you have either a) USB or b) PCMCIA  adapter for a portable.  In either case you need an compact flash adapter  (~$50 for the PC ~$10 for a portable computer).  Of course you can connect  your camera directly to the computer, but trust me, get an adapter. Make  sure your USB port works before buying the camera.8. Hope you bought an  Epson 1270 or a printer with equivalent quality (~$450)to print your  photos.  If not, get a cheaper (less resolution) camera.9. Get familar  with Shutterfly.com to send photos to your relatives.Summary: Great  camera.  If you're happy taking pictures of the family on a 35mm the  resolution of this camera won't disappoint or embarass you.  However, the  amount of work and manual reading may.  Plan on spending another $500+ for  peripherals.  Learn battery management skills.  Learn how to make every  shot count.","Date":"June 13, 2000"}
{"Title":"Follow-up, 5 weeks later..","Author":"CJinJax \"CJ\"","ReviewID":"R38D7QRLZH3Q10","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera now for 5 weeks and like it even better than when I first got it. In my first review (here)I sent my camera out for service, well it only took 8 days from out the door to back in. Nikon service is great and you can track progress along the way via an 800 #.  All the review treads here are pretty accurate for this camera, so I'll keep this basic. The Coolpix 990 is an awesome machine. The pictures are beautiful!  The camera has a swivel joint that allows you to point the lens assembly in one direction and swivel the LCD so you can see it, allowing for holding the camera overhead and focusing in on your subject over crowds. It allows for very creative pictures. I bought extra memory cards and 4 sets of rechargeable nimh batteries that last forever. I get 120+- pics per set of nimh vs 60+- with regular alkali bats, and all I have to do is recharge them to go again, BIG savings.. There are tons of add-on accys. for this camera; zoom lens, filters, external flashes, panorama brackets, you name it. I'm adding lenses and flashes myself. There is a photo book written for the 990 that details the manual settings, with examples, that allows you to take abvantage of the powerful control options built in to this camera.  Your possibilities are enormus. Or you can switch into Auto mode and, point & shoot. There are BB forums dedicated to this camera that have lots information for accy. combos, shooting advice, or knowledge sharing. Before I bought this, I read all the reviews and visited camera stores to physically check all the options available. The 990 has a great feel to it; very solid, an easy menu to navigate, and the control buttons are laid out for a comfortable, quality, feel. Competing cameras are too small for my hands and/or don't take as good a picture. I download my digital pics to on-line developers who mail photo prints back to me. No more bad pictires, and you can't tell the difference between digital vs 35mm film. However, i find that printing the photos on my printer with good paper yields photos that (when framed) rival photo finishing from a developer. This technology is truly amazing. I now find mysely going on lots of picture taking hikes experimenting with the different settings on the camera. I can see the results immediatly in the LCD, learn from my mistakes, delete the bad, make adjustments, and take more good pics -vs- taking a roll of film, getting it developed, spending lots of $ for film and processing, forgetting what settings I did in the first place, and having lots of bad pics. THe savings will pay for the camera and accessories! Oh, and in the 5 weeks I had this camera, I took almost 2000 pictures. Do the math and save the money! (2000 pics / 24 pics per roll = 83 rolls. $15 (film & developing costs) per roll and I would of spent $1,250. and had lots of bad pics to boot over the last 5 weeks. This is Really cool stuff. I don't know what else to say, Great camera, great support from Nikon, and endless resources to improve on your camera skills. You'll never be sorry you got this camera. Once you step into the digital world, you'll never go back to film. Try it, you'll like it.","Date":"October 22, 2000"}
{"Title":"Excellent Camera if you want control over your images","Author":"P. Buchan","ReviewID":"R20UVXP76IJ460","Overall":"good","Content":"I received my 990 about 2 weeks ago, and I take it everywhere with me.  I share the view of many of the reviewers -- you NEED rechargable NiMh batteries (in the first 3 days I went through 3 sets of alkelines) and a bigger memory card (one reviewer says that you can take only 10 pictures at the best quality on the enclosed 16 Mb card -- in fact, ONE picture at the top quality takes about 9 Mb, so you have to download one before you can get another on.)  These petty complaints notwithstanding, the quality of this camera and the control you get are remarkable.  One excellent aspect of the camera is that it's a wonderful camera to learn photographic technique on.  Every photo taken generates a 5 page data file that records the settings of the camera.  Take 4 pictures of a subject at different settings and you can instantly check to see which is the best, and then check what settings you were using -- f. 4.0 at 1/60th of a second, using spot metering, etc.  If I wanted to do this comparison on my 35 mm I would have to take notes of every setting, then shoot a whole roll of film and have it developed, before I could view the pictures side-by-side.  Now I can take pictures and immediately compare them.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

I was hesitant to delve into the digital realm.  Here are the pros and cons of this camera with respect to 35mm SLRs.Pros: No film to deal with.  You can view the results of your photos immediately.  This is great for playing with framing or bracketing (over/underexposing), or other creative things: you can delete the shots that just did not work.  The others you can save for printing or for use on the computer.  This feature is great for any picture you take.  You can see how it turned out.  You will know if so-and-so had their eyes closed or if things were moving too fast for the shutter speed.  I can not stress how convenient this is.  You can delete and then retake bad shots!The lens on this camera tilts every which way.  I use a tripod frequently: I do not have to adjust the tilt angle of the tripod with this camera--I just tilt the camera lens.  The LCD display frees your eye from being stuck to the viewfinder.  This is incredibly convenient.  You can hold the camera at arms-length and still see what's in the viewfinder.Compact size.  The Coolpix is smaller than most SLRs and the memory cards are so much smaller than film.Ability to control \"white balance\".  No more yellow indoor shots.  Cons:  Lack of lens flexibility.  With a SLR you click-and-twist one lens off and click-and-twist a different one on, period.  You have limited screw-on choices with this camera.  Also you have to change the camera's computer settings to use these lenses.  It takes about 30 seconds (or more if you have to drag out the manual) to make a lens change with the Coolpix.  Aperatures are more limited on this camera.  This is especially troublesome for portraits or other photos where a very wide aperature/shallow depth-of-field is often desirable.Color print quality is subject to the quality of your PC printer.  And yes, you can have professional printing done--it's just an extra hassle.  If you have a poor quality printer you may need to buy a NEW printer to get the results you want.I don't know how to explain it, but Coolpix digital pictures are just not the same as film pictures.  Some aspects are better, some seem worse.Battery issues and other issues as mentioned by other reviewers.Conclusion:I WILL NOT get rid of my 35mm SLRs--they cannot be completely replaced by the Coolpix for all situations. I WILL use my Coolpix 990 for many, many snapshots and many kinds of \"creative\" pictures, as well.","Date":"October 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"NIKON's CoolPix 990 is VERY-VERY Cool.  More than Cool!","Author":"James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"","ReviewID":"RXEBR2DMZ0I3P","Overall":"good","Content":"As a semi-professional commercial photographer, I know what quality is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line for starters, the Nikon-990 makes great  color shots with very (not so suprising) High-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos; as a very picky guy, NIKON is telling the  truth. The 5x7 prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. Since not  many prints are not made larger than 5x7, the superlative colors in this  print size will likely give the Film Camera buffs a challange. This camera  is easy to use & small, however has an exhaustive number of features.  My wife and our 13 year old, carry it on all vacation locations; And when I  don't want to carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly  shocked at the excellent picture quality of the NIKON 990 which also  includes great software, so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily  connect to the yellow video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show  of the days activities. I would recommend purchasing two (2) 80MB memory  card with the camera purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture  opportunities (an 80MB card has room for 50 shots per card at max its  resolution) without having to worry about running out of memory. So for a  day's shooting two 80MB cards will give the equivalent of four (25-shot)  rolls of film.  Since you can erase shots that you don't like, take MANY,  MANY shots and then pick the best ones you like to save, and for printing  or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the evening, I can  copy the photo-files to the lap-top's hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, so there's room for another 50 photos available in preparation  for the next days photo activities. NIKON provides serial, USB cables, and  software to accomplish this simply. Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera  with less than 2,000,000 pixels. (The older models, presently having good  sale prices, are technology of 3 years ago, and you'll wish you spent the  extra money for a higher resolution camera). Since NIKON has been the  camera business for many, many years, its no surprise that they have  created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip) with EXCELLENT Color quality  and detail. This is must have, you'll not be dissappointed. If you're on a  tighter budget check out the KODAK-280 at less than $500 which takes  excellent photos for a 2,000,000 pixel camera. If you have another few  hundred dollars, check out the SONY or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers,  which produce actual photo quality continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes;  These printers are not dot-matrix's with all the little dots. The camera  and the printer makes for a great combo family gift for under $1,500, that  anyone in the family can use without having to even turn on a computer, as  the printer prints directly off the camera memory card. Don't make yourself  craze, since DIGITAL Cameras are slightly different than a typical film  point-and-shoot cameras, be sure to read the instruciton booklet, before  pushing all the buttons. The documentation NIKON provides is very easy to  understand. So take it slow when you open the Box for the first time. It's  intuitive to use, after the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going  back to the booklets. My wife and 13 year old son love this camera (as do  I)and they have no trouble dealing with the camera's features, which are  exhaustive.  This 3.340,000 pixel camera is one of the best I've tested  yet. ONE more point, the camera can twist at its middle (permitting the  lens to point up or down, with the LCD Pannel staying directly in-line with  your eyes) which is an amazing engineering idea which gives the  photographer a whole new perspective for taking pictures without having to  have the camera pressed against your face. The LCD screen is bright even  out doors.  JLW/2000/08/25.","Date":"August 25, 2000"}

I used the photos for on-screen presentations, as well as 8x10\" printouts. The camera takes just incredible photographs, with accurate colors, and very sharp definition. Here are some other points I saw:*autofocus was fairly quick during the day, but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light* flash: powerful, but nothing you do can get rid of red-eye in virtually any shot (red-eye reduction mode is useless)*camera can store photos in separate folders, which is useful for multiple occasions*no support for Microdrive is a fatal flaw*metering system is extremely accurate; found virtually no need to use the spot meter*macro ability is second to none*for dentistry, takes wonderful intraoral photos, utilizing the chair light and the built-in flash; not terribly good, though, if you want to focus on ONE tooth, since the flash will wash things out.

{"Title":"A change of heart, nothing finer than the 990.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RM96GJETJ2LX9","Overall":"good","Content":"Keeping this short and sweet (well shorter than most I hope), I just wanted to share with any person interested in this camera some valuable information to consider while shopping for a digital camera. About 4-5 months ago I gave my Nikon 950 to my better half itching to jump on the 3.3 Mp bandwagon. Right off the bat there were only 2 cameras to consider (the Sony DSC-S70 and the Nikon 990), all other 3.3's were just not up to par with these two. After a month of research I decided that the S70 would be the better of the 2 because of the sleek point and click design and sony's proprietary memory stick. Both camera's are true 3 megapixel cameras unlike the predecessor DSC-505V, both cameras have viewfinders (a must-have for day photography), and both cameras deliver exceptional pictures. But with the far stylish look of the S70 at $200 less the S70 was my choice at the time. I then spent the next 2 months trying to locate the camera in stock and at a good price, fortunately Amazon began to sell DCs which allowed me to start pricing cameras again. However, the Sonys were all backordered, which ended up to be a blessing in disguise. A few weeks later a relative purchased the 990 and allowed me to tinker with it. Still a believer on the S70 I was reluctant in accepting the bulkier design of the camera, but after a few hours I found the 990 to be the true champ of the 3.3's. During my tinkering I found a couple facts to consider for both cameras: 1. Both cameras come with an inadequate amount of storage, so getting extra memory is a MUST. 2. 1 battery (or 4 for the Nikon) will not do the job while you are on a trip. 3. Zoom on both are extremely low, so they will never truly replace a 35mm. Taking those into consideration along with the offer Amazon had on the 990, it was hands down the better of the two for these reasons: 1. The 990 uses CF cards which are a standard in several cameras unlike the proprietary Memory Stick, also you get 16mb with the 990 compared to the 8mb with the S70. 2. A 64mb stick costs as much as a 96mb CF card. 3. The S70's memory write times were significantly slower than the 990 (due to the memory stick again). 4. The 990 uses AA batts which can be found anywhere. 5. The Manual Options for the 990 gives the photographer so much control over their photo conditions. 6. The 990s swivel design is fabulous, something totally impossible on the S70 unless your workaround happens to be your \"swivel-neck\". Now does this make the 990 a great point&click? Probably not (dont get me wrong, the 990 is an unbelievable on its \"Auto\" mode) you will thoroughly enjoy the camera more because of the configurable nature of the camera, if you plan to truly take digital photography seriously then this is your camera. Also, a few quirks you need to adjust to with the camera (all DCs have them, but these I found were actually minor since you can find workarounds for them): 1. Batteries, the 990 inhales them... get a set of at least 4 to a recommended 8 rechargables, they cost a lot, but you will need them, the NiMH rechargers work great. 2. Get at least 32-64mb of memory, 16mb = 1 picture at the 990's absolute highest setting. 3. Upgrade the firmware to 1.1 when you get the chance, the autofocus upgrade is noticable.. quite noticable. 4. The software with the camera is weak, very weak (basic app to download pictures), get a picture editing package. 5. Built-in flash not the best for distant shots, which can be compensated with an external flash. 6. Red-eye is there and red-eye suppression doesn't do the trick most of the time, but get a red-eye removing pen at your local camera shop, they work wonders. Like I said, every camera has quirks, but if I listed the quirks I discovered about the S70, I would never end this review. Finally, I assume that you can guess which camera I finally purchased off Amazon. I've been messing with it for this past week and I am now a Nikon believer (was one with the 950, but more so with this camera). I'm so eager to take pictures with it these holidays and hope that if you purchased the 990, that you find what I wrote true to your experiences as well.

Heiser","ReviewID":"RHPM27504TOKY","Overall":"good","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.  All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution & quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely. The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.  It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Zrich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.  I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low....  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.  It's a winner!","Date":"December 17, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Digital Camera!","Author":"David Richardson \"Oakport\"","ReviewID":"R2CUBPE3RZHIL3","Overall":"good","Content":"I have read, with interest, most of the reviews of this product. This is my third Coolpix Digital Camera. (Coolpix 900 and Coolpix 950.) Each generation has been a significant improvement over the previous generation, and, from my perspective, well worth the upgrade. I agree with much of the other reviewers comments:1. Definitely purchase NIMH rechargeable batteries. They last much longer than anything else. I keep 3 extra sets with my camera at all times.2. It was necessary for me to not only have a larger CompactFlash Card (64MB and 96MB) but to have two or three extras. It is an issue like carrying a couple of extra rolls of film. However, since the CompactFlash Cards are almost infinitely reusable, the more pictures you take, the quicker you recover your costs.3. Whereas the 990 takes great pictures by itself, you can improve them significantly by using a photo editing program such as Photoshop. I have found this to be true for both print film and slides. You get a much better picture when scanned and edited in your computer.4. If the quality of the final prints is important, some form of dye sublimation printing process is essential to avoid the pixelation inherent in (particularly older) inkjet technology. Epson's Photo printers seem to have solved the problem, but I prefer the dry media printers. I use an Alps MD 5000, which unfortunately is no longer available in the USA.When it comes to the drawbacks noted by several of the other reviewers, I believe familiarity with the camera and the digital system of photography will alleviate most of them. One of the reviewers seemed to have had a defective product, rather than anything inherently wrong with the 990.The only real complaint I have about the 990 (and I believe it is a problem with any digital camera that depends on an LCD view screen) is that it is very difficult to see the images in bright sunlight. I think Nikon should design a hood to shade the screen. I have done makeshift things without great success.Overall, I am well pleased with my 990. I rarely use my Nikon film cameras, and then usually for long lens shots. I can't recommend this camera too highly.","Date":"October 5, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great Camera - Low Quality Support","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RXD8WQRPF819X","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera just arrived from Amazon to me yesterday.Since I have used and owned several high-end consumer digital cameras I note the following should others be interested in this camera.1.  This camera is for a true  enthusiast, a person testing high end consumer digital cameras before  buying the professional line for business, or for I guess, a person who  just has the bucks to have the latest.2.  I love it since I am  constantly imaging events or children and need to have a camera that is  fast (does not take for ever for it to focus and capture the image from the  time you click the camera to the time it captures the image to put on disk.  It records to disk (memory/digital film - whatever you want to call it),  It needs to have capacity for high storage, fast downloads.3.  The  camera itself in comparison to other cameras of this style and caliber is  quite easy to use.  (The swivel feature is really nice to get those angles  that are harder to get)4. Minimal weight and size for its features.  Nice.5.  Getting the images to computer uses the drag and drop concept  of windows.  Since at the point of arrival, this camera did not have its  software ready to make upload easy like most cameras have.  Per the note  packaged in the camera, it will not be available for Win 98 users till June  2000ish.The drag and drop is not intuitive.  You should have reasonable  windows knowlege to figure out that you need to open both the Nikon viewer  and a window set on the location of where you want to put the images.  DRAG  and DROP.  Copy and paste does NOT work.But once you get the idea using  the camera with USB cable is so fast in comparison to that of serial....  this flies. 6.  Though they do now have 24/7 cs....I was on hold for 2  hours 10 minutes before the line was cut off.  Though I had them on speaker  phone, was able to have dinner and dress the kids for bed, it was  annoying.7.  So, since Nikon service is rather poor (unless you are  talking about the sales dept), I reccomend that if you buy this camera, and  are spending this kind of money on a camera, you need to have: good  digital camera knowlege/experience, very good windows and windows imaging  knowlege, wants to be able to have high quality prints made when that  \"oh so special\" image is actually captured to disk and a really  trustworthy dealer.","Date":"May 16, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 990: Sophisticated Digital Point & Shoot","Author":"Gary W. Sanders","ReviewID":"R1O0L31GWEZZPZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I have used Nikon 35mm cameras for many years.  I have also bought many point & shoot cameras.  When digital point & shoot cameras exceeded three megapixels, I learned I could get sharp 8x10 prints on my inkjet printer that came close to the quality of 35mm 8x10's.  The Coolpix 990 has many of the same features as its 35mm counterparts.  For example, it has similar metering patterns: matrix, center-weighted, and spot.  It also has selectable focusing and spot metering areas, just like the F5 and F100 35mm cameras.  It also has flash compensation, exposure compensation, fill flash, red-eye reduction, and slow sync flash, just like the 35mm \"big boys\".  If all this sounds complicated, trust your instincts.  This is a camera aimed at experienced photographers, or those who are interested in a fully adjustable point and shoot digital camera with all the bells and whistles.  A nice feature of this camera is that it also has an \"automatic\" mode, which makes most of the decisions for you.  That mode yields acceptable results, and is a nice way to get used to the camera.  I would recommend this camera to someone who is very interested in top quality digital photography.  With the automatic mode, even the more timid or inexperienced members of the family can use it and get good results.  One final bit of advice: Expect to buy additional Compact Flash storage media cards.  I carry two 128MB cards with me and can shoot all day without worries.  Good Luck!","Date":"October 20, 2000"}
{"Title":"Nikon Coolpix 990 -- Six Months and Six Thousand Pictures","Author":"Michael Gordon","ReviewID":"R2RBLNG12ICO5A","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought from Amazon.com and it has paid for itself many times over.  I have made over 6,000 photographs with it.  I carry plenty of battery and memory (two sets of NiMH AA batteries and a Digipower battery pack), two 32 mb, one 64 mb, and one 80 mb memory card.  ON a shooting trip I take about 400 pictures or more per day.  Quality is excellent; I have made full page, full bleed color brochures with it.  Most of the time I use XGA mode, high quality compression, 400 kilobyte per picture.  For pro work I use full size high quality, but still JPEG, 1 megabyte per picture.  It is exceptionally well suited to smoothly textured subjects (sky, water, glass) where the lack of grain is paramount.  It is somewhat less suited to intricate subjects (forest).  The swivel LCD screen makes formerly difficult shots easy (low or high viewing angles).  Macro focus is excellent.  Color balance and exposure control very good; you will want to edit most of your shots in a good bitmap editor (Corel Photopaint for instance) to rotate upright and equalize color.  You can also apply a \"film-like\" s-curve adjustment to make it look just like film if you wish.","Date":"January 10, 2001"}
{"Title":"Pretty darn nice camera, but.....","Author":"C J","ReviewID":"R2JX37TFSNV2XZ","Overall":"good","Content":"I just bought a Coolpix 990 last week and LOVE the camera.  Out of the box, you just put the batteries and flastcard in, turn it on and, point and shoot.  It's that easy.  USB image transfer to computer is easy, just drag and drop. But the software included isn't that great, Nikon had to send me a backordered disk and the catalog software is a hassle to figure out.  I just want to snap pictures. The camera eats batteries, about 60 shots (half with flash)per set of 4 bats, so get some rechargables, nimh are the best. And get an extra memory card too.. I edit shots in PhotoShop or MS Picture-it then print them out.  Great resolution and color.  Wonderful pictures. Bye bye 35 mm film. Now the negatives.  My camera broke today, 8 days out of the box.  I have to send it to the service center.  Tech support must be hearing a lot of the same thing, (wont shut off, zoom clicks, no menu differientation) its like the program shorted out or something. SO am I satisfied? YES!  I don't want a refund or another camera (I looked at them ALL), just the camera fixed and back in my hands.  I highly recommend the camera to all, it's a great camera, easy to use, takes great pics, and I can do a lot of advanced stuff too, but not til it's back from the shop. Happy snapping.

{"Title":"Nikon has a winner, IF you have a card reader.","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R2LJKORGDODZR","Overall":"good","Content":"Out of fairness to Nikon, I need to provide a sequel to my previous critical comments. When used with a CF card reader to communicate with your computer, this system is nothing short of astounding. This is the first digital camera I have used, and I expected to get a semi-toy that mainly  lived because of the gee-whiz digital 'film'. This is no toy. It's got most  of the features of high-end 35mm cameras, and is a legitimate professional  tool. Of course, its 3.3 megapixel resolution can't compete with properly  exposed 35mm film, but for many applications it is enough. I printed a  full-size 8 1/2 x 11 page, and the detail was pretty respectable. The range  of focus and exposure control options (including, of course, fully manual)  make this a camera that can handle many of the oddball situations where  I've had to burn lots of Polaroid film to get the setup right. It's a shame  that Amazon's catalog pages fail to indicate how limited this system can be  without the extra-cost card reader (not a lot of money, but it also burns a bunch of  time to try to figure out how to get by with the cables it's shipped with).","Date":"May 10, 2000"}
{"Title":"Superb!","Author":"R. Lade \"prophoto\"","ReviewID":"R1ZPTT8QU3NM53","Overall":"good","Content":"Having been a Nikon user for 95% of my photographic career, the 990 was a natural purchase.  This is a wonderful camera in every fashion!  It's made in true Nikon tradition--durable, dependable, and simple to use.  Does it do what my D1 will do--no it won't, but it wasn't intended to.  However, it does share many similar functions to the D1 or a well-equiped SLR.  You have the option of aperture or shutter speed priority, program (and program shift), as well as full manual control.  And if you use the LCD panel for viewing, you do have a digital SLR of sorts, so you can use filters (such as a polarizer) and others.  So you do have a very capable and creative tool with this camera.  My main purpose for buying this camera was to have a digital \"point-and -shoot\" that wasn't as cumbersome as the D1 or an SLR and didn't require carrying around an array of lenses but still gave me some of the SLR tools that would be useful.  In other words, this camera allows me to do digital imaging and keep it simple.My only bone of contention with the 990 is the flash.  Expect to remove red-eye from 90 percent of your people-pictures.  And the red-eye reduction feature doesn't help much.  The flash is just too close to the lens--period!  I bought the flash bracket so I can use my Nikon SB-28 flash and that proved to be a flawless combination.  The only problem with that arrangement is that it sort of defeats the point-and-shoot purpose to a small extent.  The only other issue would be seeing the LCD panel in bright light outdoors, but I imagine that's probably a typical problem with most of these cameras.  But here's a little tip.  Take a piece of black posterboard, fashion it into a square tube the size of the LCD panel, put some narrow strips of velcro on it and around the LCD panel and voila--a viewing hood that works like a charm!  Also, as is probably also typical for these cameras, don't expect long battery life if you use the LCD panel all the time.  Get some rechargeable metal hydroxide batteries.  The life span is far, far longer.  The Everyready system works very well.  Aside from that, for general shooting outdoors and indoors, I love this camera.  I have to be honest and state that I didn't do a lot of comparing.  I had (and still have) the Coolpix 800 and loved it as well, and again, being a Nikon freak, there wasn't any indecision here.  I simply wanted a \"point-and-shoot\" digital that had more capabilities than the 800 had.  If I'm doing some really serious shooting for publication or exibition, then it's time for the D1 or the old faithful SLR and slide film.Don't think twice if you're considering this camera.  It's top-notch all the way!","Date":"February 8, 2001"}
{"Title":"Simply the best compact 3.3 Mpixel digital camera","Author":"Toralf Sandker \"toralfsan\"","ReviewID":"R1OHSRX67O6XTE","Overall":"good","Content":"I tried it, I borrowed it, so I had to buy it after using it for free a week. The only thing I miss is a pentaprism SLR viewfinder, being able to use my Nikkor lenses and just a little faster action. But, that's begging for a Nikon D1 at 5x the price and 3x the weight (without a lens). The Coolpix 990 has a sharp 3x zoom lens, rendering 9 Megabyte images from moderate wide-angle to short telephoto with the choice of a quick all-auto shooting mode or a fully customizable auto/manual shooting mode. Also you can choose between previewing the image through the fast real zoom rangefinder or the near-100% digital color LCD monitor, plus you can watch the settings in the simple LCD symbol display or complete data superimposed over the color LCD image.I like to let the camera choose all settings for quick, instantly ready snapshots, or use any of the multiple features to get the best possible semi-automatic or manual exposure when time and needs are suitable.Images look great on a 8x10 \" ink jet print, I have even sold a picture for a graphics trade magazine cover, and it was a wide-format original which had to be cropped.The main point, with Nikon Coolpix 990, you always have the choice. Plus, it is well built, compact, rugged, quick, and allows you to choose from a wide range of add-ons to build a system that is ... anything but a D1.","Date":"October 9, 2000"}

I tried the 950 and was very impressed, but the CoolPix 990s improved resolution, refinements, flexibility and ease of connectivity to my PC (plug & play using the USB cable supplied with the camera) make this a hand's down winner in all respects. I've purchased separately a larger capacity memory card since the 16MB capacity memory card supplied was inadequate for a day's worth of photos (approximately 20 normal shots). Notwithstanding the inherent demanding power requirements of a digital camera (keep a spare quad of AAs with you at all times), the CoolPix 990 is a must for any serious digital shutterbug.","Date":"May 15, 2000"}
{"Title":"This is a great digital camera with few drawbacks","Author":"\"vdschee\"","ReviewID":"RMPII0NCO8RWY","Overall":"good","Content":"While I have followed the emergence of digital cameras with interest over the last few years, I have to admit that one concern/requirement ultimately convinced me that the purchase of a digital camera made sense:  the availability of 3 MegaPixel resolution cameras. The resolution of pictures taken with a Nikon Coolpix 990 is indeed extremely high.  This camera has three \"resolution levels.\"  I usually use the middle level: the \"Normal\" mode.  The resolution of pictures taken in this mode is very, very good.  I would not hesitate to make 8\" by 6\" prints of such pictures.  Rarely do I use the \"Fine\" mode (there is really no reason to use it in my view). In the \"Normal\" mode, I believe that I get about 20-25 pictures on my memory card.  For my purposes that is adequate. Of course, my initial approach has proven too simplistic:  there are other factors (other than resolution alone) that you should consider before buying a digital camera! If are thinking of buying a digital camera to photograph subjects that move quickly and erratically (such as a young child), you will soon realize that taking digital pictures is not ideal.  While I understand that the Nikon is relatively quick compared to other digital cameras, it still takes a fraction of a second to actually \"take\" the picture after pressing the button.  So you end up with a lot failed pictures that would have been great if taken with a conventional camera.  The menu (for deleting pictures and other functions) is very intuitive and I believe it allows even those of us who don't read the owners manual cover-to-cover (like me) to get a lot out of the camera. I have one problem with the camera that is of a more serious nature:  often I take a picture that will cause the camera to \"crash\" when downloaded or viewed on the display (I often use the useful \"slide show\" feature).  It generates an error message and so far hasn't affected the other pictures on the memory card (but I have not been able to recover the subject picture).  I don't know if this is a problem with the memory card or with the camera - but it is annoying.  Without this problem, I would have given this camera a 5 star rating... I like the ergonomics of this camera and it feels like it's solidly constructed.  Rechargeable batteries (AA) are the way to go (they last surprisingly long).  Knowing this camera's features and limitations, I would still buy this camera again...","Date":"January 4, 2001"}

I'd like to think that I understand photography better than most folks.  When I first bought the camera I had a bit of buyers remorse.  I'll admit it was a bit expensive toy purchase for me.  After using it for 3 mos I am blown away with the images I capture. I've taken pictures with it that have been published.  I would repeat the purchase in an instant.  Everyone writes the same stuff in their reviews so this is about what to get and not get with the camera.This camera has a lot of features and the documentation is just OK so get the Nikon Digital Photography book.  You may actually understand what you are doing then.  GET 2 sets of NiMH rechargable Batteries!  This camera eats regular batteries for lunch.  The NiMH batteries last longer than regular batteries. Get a bigger memory card. 80M will give you about 100 pictures in medium resolution.  Get a fast card 8X or better. Don't be cheap here.  The faster cards will cut down your cycle time between photos.  Something to think about as you are missing shots waiting for the camera to load the image you shot. In theory these things last forever, so buy the best. Get a card reader with your camera.  It will dowmload in a fraction of the time camera direct will download. Get the 24mm wide angle adapter lens.  I promise you will love it and use it all the time. I have two cases for my camera.  One that holds just the camera and my 24mm lens. I take it with me when I want to grab some quick shots.  The other case holds my battery charger and other lenses in addition to the camera.  It's overkill but it works for me.  Whatever you do PROTECT your camera! I don't think I'd buy the 3X extender again.  I don't use it that often and it was expensive.  \"Wider is better\" If you are in low light you will want to get a tripod and have your subject stand still.

{"Title":"There's Simply No Comparison!","Author":"cinemagirl","ReviewID":"R36Q5MKIHSI5GT","Overall":"good","Content":"I started researching digital cameras nearly a year ago, as I had decided a while back that I wanted a digital camera. As an amateur photographer, I was looking for something reliable that produced excellent photographs. There were a plethora of websites containing opinions on which camera to purchase; I even took a few compatibility tests, and most of the results named the Nikon Coolpix 990 as my best bet. After asking others for their opinions, I received an overwhelmingly positive response to this camera. There were  a few people who deemed the Coolpix 990 too pricey and convoluted, and I did consider getting some other less expensive cameras (like Fuji and Kodak), but my propensity for top-of-the-line items ultimately won. I purchased the 990 here on Amazon, and it arrived in a couple of days (thanks for the speedy service, Amazon!). There were several fears, however. A few people have said that such a high-end camera was not exactly necessary, that a cheaper camera would do the job. Initially, I had only planned to use this camera to post photos on websites, but I then realised that if Im going to spend a few hundred dollars on a big toy, I might as well have it do everything (namely 8 x 10 prints).Having just returned from a short vacation in London, England, I can now accurately attest to the 990s excellence. I took this camera everywhere, and I soon abandoned my camera bag and I hung it around my neck for easy access. The tube, Parliament, Tower Bridge, pubs, restaurants, streets, shopping centres....I went to many places and took several photographs along the way. Before this trip I had really only used this camera for a few photos around my town, but now that Id taken it on vacation, I have a more lucid perception. This camera is phenomenal, and although I cannot ramble on in technical terms, I can articulate the ease with which I took photos, the terrific quality of the prints, and the sheer professionalism of it. Some specific points:* The LCD is nicely-sized and clear, although I would stock up on NiHM batteries. I played around with the menu settings for such a few minutes, and the batteries completely drained. During my trip I shut off the screen to conserve the batteries. * The swivel lens is convenient and affords a lot of versatility. Some people consider it odd, but I thought it was a nice touch.* 16 MB memory card included in the box. Instead of buying more cards, however, I purchased the IOMEGA Pocketzip (formerly Clik! Drive) in order to dump my photos onto it during my trip. Highly recommended procedure!* Some red-eye when you use the flash, but I've stopped using it altogether, as I prefer the soft effect of photos without it. In conclusion, I am extremely satisfied with this marvelous camera. I take it everywhere now, and I cant imagine being as happy with anything else (until the next model comes out, of course). Albeit expensive, it is worth every penny. The photographs are amazing, the settings numerous so that you can customize it to your needs, and the convenience priceless!","Date":"December 17, 2000"}

{"Title":"An excellent product for digital imaging","Author":"Rich Brown","ReviewID":"R3NRTXCJ69F128","Overall":"good","Content":"I'd have to say that until this camera came out I'd been banking my imaging needs on 35mm that'd been scanned.  With the 990 I feel the days of film development are long gone for this product serves my needs above and  beyond what's necessary or even expected.I am running this product in a  professional environment and it is performing exceedingly well.  Some of my  work has been in macro (e-mail me for a sample macro pic) and general  studio work.  The generous number of features makes this camera rival some  high-end 35mm SLR's.  If you photograph for the web (As I do) this product  surely will not disappoint.The down side is that it came with only a  16mb Flash Card and a USB to plug into the camera.  I will likely buy a USB  card reader so that I can plug my cards in to my PC for uploading pics.","Date":"May 14, 2000"}
{"Title":"Great pics, some quirks","Author":"Chessninja \"Mig Greengard\"","ReviewID":"R2CO37IT77ROVF","Overall":"good","Content":"Photo quality is remarkable, including excellent colors and detail. Of course these are the most important aspects of a digital camera. Aside from that, other nice tricks include being able to swivel the lens and take mpeg movies. Some complaints you should be aware of:- Not having a case seems chintzy when you're paying over $800 for a camera. - Bad red-eye even with that mode turned on. Lens is probably too close to the flash on the body. - Settings are not for the amateur. You need to spend a lot of time with the manual before using the complicated menus. I've used the \"restore settings\" button more than once. Don't pay for settings you don't use! - Flash seems weak, or I haven't found the right exposure+flash balance for taking shots in imperfect light from more than 12 feet. - Get a large flash card or don't bother. With \"normal\" photos in 3.3 megapixel cameras weighing in at 750K+, you should have at least a 32MB card. Over 100MB cards are really where digicams come into their own. - Flash card readers are also nice. The Coolpix USB is fine, but if you have 50 pictures it can still take a while. (Have to download new software for Win2000, a little annoying.) - The mpeg movies it produces are 40-second silent films, no sound! (Unless I've really gotten screwed up by the settings...) - The AC adapter is definitely worth it if you use the camera frequently, and you will.","Date":"November 24, 2000"}

This is a general follow-up on my two earlier reviews, Sept 26, 00 CJ, and Oct 22,00 CJinPa. I'm updating this review because of the enjoyment I get from this camera and all the support I recieved from other \"posters\" as I researched prior to my purchase. If you consider this product, you'll LOVE your purchase.I snapped a lot of pics with this thing and print out the good shots on my printer for framing. Believe me, I've taken lots of shots, but only a few \"really good\" ones. BUT, my technique gets better all the time. This \"learning curve\" would of sent me to the poor house if I used my 35mm Nikon and had to develop all those rolls of film.  Digital is \"free\" after you make your initial investment in the gear.  I bought a pile of add-on lenses and flash assys. for the camera to get the most out of it.There is a great E-Book by Peter iNova \"Mastering Nikon Digital Cameras\" ($50)that is a detailed 990 camera; instruction manual - photo techniques - editing & printing tutorial that is the PERFECT companion to your 990 purchase. The E-Book is interactive and will help you MASTER the 990 to its potential. Get this if you get the camera, i believe this is a MANDATORY purchase. If this was out when I bought the camera, I'd of saved 3 months off my learning curve.Well, not many more good things to say that haven't been said before. Excellent quality pictures, great quality camera, and ample support from Nikon (if ever needed). This camera is a great buy that will leave you happy with your investment 4,500 pictures later. Enjoy your new purchase.","Date":"January 29, 2001"}

My wife and I debated a long time what kind of camera to get, a regular nikon or a digital one. We decided on the digital because we liked the idea of printing photos at home, and sharing photos with family on the internet. And with a relatively inexpensive photoprinter (HP Photosmart P1000) we print photos as good as I've ever gotten back from dropping them off to be developed. Also, with a little photo-editing you can turn almost any picture into a winner.  This lets you to turn pictures that would otherwise end up at the bottom of a shoebox, into family treasures. We have two children and this camera has allowed us to produce the best pictures we have ever taken of our children.","Date":"March 3, 2001"}

The layout of the camera is improved and the joypad on the back  makes navigating the menus quick and easy.  The programable function keys  let you have the features you need under your fingers when you shoot one  handed.  The only way it could be better would be if it was waterproof.","Date":"May 9, 2000"}

I now have a furniture store which both my wife and I own.  We also have a crew that builds custom furniture. For our web site we needed good photos.  We have designated an area in the store mainly for photography. We chose the Nikon 990 coolpix digital camera because of the 3.34 megapixels and the reputation of the Nikon name. We purchased the camera when it first became available,I have had it since sometime in July 2000.  It took me  several weeks to learn the camera.  The documentation is very difficult to follow.  However I feel that I know the camera well enough now to use it to its fullest extent, we are getting incredible results. The Express photo program that comes with the camera is very good. I am able to correct the flower pot shape from looking down on the subject and crop for the desired results. In one previous ratings red eye was mentioned, and I also found that no matter what you do you get some serious red eye problems. In another program (Adobi Photo Shop) I zoom in on an eye so that the eye fills the entire monitor screen then I take all the red squares and turn them into the color I want, with amazing results.  If anyone wants to know more detail of how I do it please feel free to email me.","Date":"December 2, 2000"}

I agree with others that the 990's menu system takes some time to master if you really want to maximize the potential of this camera.  You can use the auto mode to take great pictures right out of the box though.  This camera, just like the 950 is a hog for batteries.  I like the fact that I can carry regular AA batteries as an emergency backup, but better yet, get two sets of rechargeables.  I use the camera to take \"crude\" pictures of radiographs and intraoperative pictures. The ability to select for light source makes this much easier.  It does a very good job for the radiographs and takes excellent surgical pictures (great color accuracy).  The flash unit is fairly weak so consider trying to get the elusive external flash adapter (hard to find in stock).  That's my only complaint with these Nikon digital cameras.  The accessories are sometimes very hard to get.","Date":"December 23, 2000"}

McEachen","ReviewID":"R2XNHYVX3G33TV","Overall":"good","Content":"Boy - when this camera can get a good focus lock, there's enough lighting, the planets are in alignment, and angels sing, the pictures that come out of this camera are OUTSTANDING.The only problem, though, are those pesky angels and planets. They just don't cooperate.I've used an Olympus  C2000-Z for the past year. I found the pictures to be of somewhat  consistent quality - some better than others - maybe 3-5 out of a  \"roll\" (16MB smartcard) to be worth sharing with my family.I bought the Nikon 950  before I got the Oly - and had to return it out of frustration with the  user interface and the inability of the camera to obtain a focus lock - and  take the picture.And that's if the camera didn't lock up. Heck - it's  not Windows. You shouldn't need to \"reboot\" your camera. In a  week, the 990 locked up (requiring me to take the batteries out) five or  six times. The 950 was just as bad.I found a better UI with the 990 -  but similar frustrations with focus. In low light situations, you better be  on a tripod, and have a flashlight handy to let the camera get a focus  lock. From what I understand, there are cameras coming out (Fuji has one)  that have what SLR owners are used to - a low light focus assist  illumination lamp. This camera desparately needs one.If you need to take  a picture of something moving - get a focus lock BEFORE your subject gets  into view - or the camera becomes very confused, and you're left staring at  the viewfinder's blinking green \"I'm not ready to take a picture - I  can't focus\" light. And your subjects look at you, smiling politely...  \"Did you get it?\"\"No.\"\"Boy, that camera is  slow, huh? I thought the box said 'superhigh performance'?\"\"Ha  ha. Very funny. Where's my old Oly? I want this shot.\"Anyway - make  sure you buy it at some place that has a 30 day money back guarantee. You  may need to exercise that guarantee. (Besides the bad focus  and system hangs, I also found Nikon's Windows software to be buggy. You'll  want to get a standalone USB card reader. And why didn't Nikon embrace  SmartCard Type II?

{"Title":"great camera, a few small flaws.","Author":"Charlie Wallace","ReviewID":"R3F4E9CR7Q523M","Overall":"good","Content":"overall i've been pleased with the 990, the only drawbacks are(1) disappointed in the manufacturers claims about standard AA battery life, usually 15mins is average, not the hour and half claimed. NiMHs are a must, I use 1600maH which usually lasts 12 hours at least. Get real nikon, ship at least nicads, sure its a cost issue, but its very environmentally wasteful and poor customer relations to ship batteries that last for 15 mins or less. (2) The manual is weak, but is typical of translated manuals. 3) accessories are hard to get hold of, and the remote release is expensive (although its feature loaded) an IR or RF based remote would be nice, most other camera makers offer them. (4) suffers from red eye a lot. (5) low quality software on the PC, even lower on the MAC, crashes often on win2k, even after the update to camera firmware and PC software, crashes on first time use everytime. (6) menu access is slow, camera could do with a faster cpu, latest software release helps things somewhat but it could be better. (7) one very small thing that would only affect a few people, is the inbuilt IR filter for the lens, which means you can't do the near IR style photography thats popular with other digicams.other than those small quibbles, its generally an excellent camera, its a lot of fun to use.  Once you are setup with NiMHs and a decent sized CF card its easy sailing, we've had it for about two months and are still finding new things about it. Pictures taken are great, the jpg compression levels work well,the low is very low quality suitable for web pictures, but the high end is good, and the highest setting, with no compression is excellent.","Date":"January 22, 2001"}

Pandolfo \"jpandolfo\"","ReviewID":"R61EOPCPARUQD","Overall":"good","Content":"I picked up this camera used to do some assignment work for an online publication.  I specifically wanted full manual control and the ability to use an external flash (the internal flash is almost useless). The large handgrip is a welcomed change from most other digicams out there.  It feels nice and solid in your hand while the no-slip surface does its job admirably.  The shutter release button is solid and the mode jog dial is placed perfectly.  The user interface could benefit from minor usability improvements, but for the most part is easy to use and learn in seconds without consulting the manual.  And to echo what everyone else mentions, battery life lasts me about 40 shots with the monitor and flash turned off.  I take along a spare set of AA batteries for short outings.  For longer outings, I mount a DigiPower DPS9000 external battery pack into the tripod mountOverall picture quality is good, but not to the level of my 35mm film cameras under moderate scrutiny.  For web content, picture quality is awesome, though.  Resolution and sharpness are perfectly acceptable for 4x6 prints.  Nice to have the 3:2 ratio to let you print uncropped 4x6 images.  Macro capabilities are great.Since I prefer to print my personal images, I feel the Coolpix's weakness is in its color reproduction.  Photos printed on a Fuji Frontier 370 system seem to lack a certain saturation or 'punch' in various colors - things seem to be on the dull or compressed side and not very vibrant, even if the original scene was.  This is especially noticeable when you hold a digital print next to a film print when both have used the same exposure and focal length and have been printed on the same machine.Sure, I can spend time in PhotoShop adjusting curves and levels, but that's more time consuming than it's worth if you ask me.  For a few photos, no big deal.  But if I just shot 50+ images that are keepers, I'm not going to spend countless hours tweaking each one.  I found that a semi-decent shortcut is to get the ICC profile for my target printer and batch up all the images in PhotoShop to have the profile applied automatically.  I then spend $0.29/print at my local camera shop getting them printed.  Inexpensive, fast, sharp, and durable -there's no way I can print at home at that price or time savings, and I doubt anyone else can.PROS:Sharp images (provided you keep the sharpness setting on Auto)Easy user interfaceInexpensive on the used marketDecent build qualityCONS:Condensed color rangeSlow to focus and fire shutter (2-3 sec.)Supplied software is almost uselessViewfinder shows too little of actual image (85%?)","Date":"June 5, 2003"}

I've previously been using a JVC digital camcorder (which flaked out on us - if you ever get one, be sure to get a good extended warranty to cover complete equipment failure), so I find myself comparing the Coolpix  to the camcorder.  Picture quality on the Coolpix is excellent, although it  seems to not perform too well under low lighting (at least, not without  using the flash).  The optical zoom isn't that spectacular, either (only  3x).  Daylight pix are great though, sharp and clear, and there are none of  those JPEG \"artifacts\" you see from cheaper cameras.  I found  the Coolpix to be quite usable right out of the box.  It comes with 4 AA  batteries, which don't seem as short-lived as I'd been fearing. Then again,  I'm more used to the camcorder whose battery only lasted 15-20 minutes, so  the Coolpix seems far superior there already.  I did, nonetheless, order a  set of NiMH batteries + charger.  Save your money on the extras, though  - if you're only taking photos for the web, you probably don't need a  bigger compact flash card - the 16Mb card included with the camera will  hold 40 \"basic\" quality images, which are 2048x1536 pixels.  And  forget about buying an expensive card reader. ...  Or you could just buy an a/c adapter for your camera and run off  electric while you download images from the camera.","Date":"July 19, 2000"}

They're very easy to load into Premiere to add special effects.  This camera has options and features designed to work in all environments.  Make sure you have V1.1 software, though.  With V1.0, I was DYING while waiting for the camera to store all the pictures I took while in continuous mode.  This is one of my favorite modes, especially with soccer games.  But, with V1.1, as soon as you let go of the shutter release, the camera is ready to take more pictures.  This fix makes the camera as near perfect as can be!  I purchased the 2X telephoto lens...OH MY GOODNESS.  This lens is incredible.  I think the pictures are even SHARPER with this lens on.  It amazes me.  The 3X telephoto lens is now available and I have no doubt that it will exceed my expectations.  I also purchased the remote shutter release which adds more features to the camera like time lapse photography!  Cool for sunsets/sunrises.

This camera is very popular for this use as the quality of the macro photographs is excellent.  All of the positives and most of the negatives have already been stated about this camera.  I want to add an irritating design flaw that to my knowledge cannot be fixed.  After careful, but frequent use for 3 years, the plastic 'nub' that the battery compartment door latches to has first bent and then broken off.  The plastic piece is part of a large casting and cannot be replaced.  This has happened to 4 Nikon 990s used at our school.  I complained about this defect at a recent meeting and found that multiple colleagues at other institutions have experienced the identical defect.Using adhesive tape to wrap the battery compartment shut has offered a temporary solution, but this unit uses batteries too quickly for taping to be more than a temporary stop gap until we buy new cameras..Nikon 990s are still readily available on the web.

{"Title":"Great camera","Author":"M. Warren","ReviewID":"RRU08KTMGKC2A","Overall":"good","Content":"I was hesitatant about buying a digital camera, especially at the price. But after seeing many web sites with images from the camera, I took the plunge. Shooting digitally is a bit different from traditional photography. I tend to use the LCD screen to set up shots, and you can't really fire shots off as quickly with a digital camera, it has to autofocus, etc. But, I, and others who've seen my photos, love the quality. I print them out on a HP Deskject 1220, which when using photo quality paper makes brilliant prints.I took this camera to France. I shot over 1,500 images. I took 4 flash cards with me, since I had no way to upload the images while I was there. The images I got from that trip were worth the price of the camera alone. I now have a bound book of images I printed on my HP. There will always be arguments over film and digital cameras. I own both. I love each for what they can do. The Nikon CP990 delivers great quality, a lot of flexibility in use, which takes some time to learn. You can shoot macro, adjust contrast, adjust the EV value, shoot in black and white and even capture 30 seconds of video.I bought the Nikon wide angle 28 lens. The standard lens just doesn't capture as much as I liked.All in all, this has been a great tool to have. I shoot almost daily with it.

I still give it 4 stars, though my reasons are a little different.What's good about it: The photos. The quality is amazing. Combined with my Epson photo printer, I get stunning results. Far better than going to a photo lab. The cost. Yes, the camera and accessories are initially expensive to buy, but (as I predicted) I have saved a small fortune in film and developing costs. Ease of use. This camera is as easy to use as you want it to be. There are lots of options, but I find I take most photos using the automatic settings. Also, it's small enough to just throw in a bag without the need for extra lenses, etc. I bought a telephoto lens, but find I rarely use it.The main problem is batteries. The camera devours batteries like you wouldn't believe. Be prepared to either spend a small fortune on them (and get weighed down carrying around lots of them), or to buy several sets of rechargeables. Other things to think about: Last time I complained that adding lenses disabled the flash. While this is still true, I have found it not to be as big a problem as I expected. There are many occasions when I might have used a flash with a 35mm camera but don't need it with this one. It is still a problem in many indoor situations, however. Getting the photos into a computer can also be a problem. I have no problems with my laptop, the enclosed usb cable/software works very well. On a recent trip I had to use my husband's laptop instead and couldn't get the software to run properly, despite it supposedly being compatible with Windows 2000. I bought a cheap card reader and this solved the problem. All in all, I am extremely happy with the camera and still recommend it.

{"Title":"Great Camera!","Author":"\"karenjr\"","ReviewID":"REWRBCVPNB5Q3","Overall":"good","Content":"This camera is great.  For those of you who are new to photography, it operates as a point-and-shoot.  If you are looking to advance your skills, it offers manual ability (apeture, shutter speed and focus).  This camera has all the features of a Nikon SLR.  This camera takes sharp and clear pictures, and is definately worth the price!The only downfall to the camera is that is is prone for causing redeye due the close proximity of the lens and the flash.  Nikon just introduced the Nikon Coolpix 995 that is essentialy the same as the 990 but with a pop-up flash.  That should eliminate the red eye.I would expect the 995 to drive down the price of the 990.  If the price between the two camerasis incidental, go for the pop-up flash to elimate the red eye.  If the price difference is alot, stick with the 990 - you won't be disappointed, and editing software makes it super easy to remove redeye.I upload my images to photoworks.com.  Their software allow you to edit the picture before you send it - their red eye reduction is a snap.  The quality of the pictures is tremendous - noone ever knows the image is digital!Good luck with the camera - you are guarenteed to love it!","Date":"June 18, 2001"}

Rush","ReviewID":"R2VJE99SR1RPVV","Overall":"good","Content":"I have had one or 6 of these excellent cameras with various faults over the years,some with broken lenses and some with broken battery doors - as previously mentioned they knock the spots off most 5 MP current cameras - more megapixels = more noise. They are a simple design and also very easy to dismantle and repair.The battery door problem can easily be repaired by drilling 2 small holes next to where the tabs have broken off ( through the metal front) and screwing 2 appropriately sized black self tapping screws long enough to catch onto the metal lugs of the door. No need to strip the camera down and it will last as long as the rest of the camera.Phil","Date":"August 4, 2006"}

I use the Nikon coolpix 990 nearly every day of my working week.  There are several features that make this product particularly good.  The macro facility allows me to take pictures of small features (e.g. fingertips and even down the operating microscope) in enormous detail.  The large buffer means that there is no delay between pressing the shutter release and acquiring a picture. The colour reproduction is excellent and (importantly) very realistic. Battery consumption is also good when using Ni-metal hydride batteries.  I need a change of batteries every 10-14 days despite daily use (20-40 Mb of photographs at basic resolution) with the flash on for nearly all pictures.  The only drawback is the built-in flash which works under most circumstances but may occasionally pose a problem when taking pictures at short range because of the asymmetric position. Overall, the camera is so good that it has rapidly become the 'standard' issue for nearly all plastic surgery residents in London.","Date":"June 2, 2001"}

It's flexible, automatic or manual operation and the quality is approching top end 35mm boxes (I've used a Canon SLX for about 30 years) for the majority of one's use. The 3.+MP is the key when shooting images for 8x10 displays. It is necessary to upgrade the memory amount to a minimum of 64MB(~ [$]) and use the 1,500mahr batteries w/ a charger, a set of 4 batteries will cost about [$](with charger, about [$]).  I shoot in 35mm mode at high resolution and get about 5-6 hours of battery life & ~ 60 images per 64MB of RAM & use the USB download to my laptop.  If most of your work is indoors, get the optional AC adapter ~ [$] I have 2 other digcams, the image quality of those are ok for small displayed images up to about 4 x 5's, but the 990 is top shelf for the price!

You may be able to get a good deal on a used model.  I use it as camera that is shared by many departments where I work, so it gets heavy use.The quality of photos taken in bright light on the \"fine\" setting is stunning and prints well as 8 x 10s (you can even get away with larger sizes, if you don't mind a little pixelation).  The camera's auotmatic mode is adequate for most shots, but you can adjust the shutter speed and other customizable features.  The pivoting lens body is also handy to get into tight spaces.  The LCD screen is bright, but can be hard to read outdoors.Battery life is 40+ photos with rechargables.  I don't recommend using Alkalines with this camera, but they work in a pinch.The biggest drawback with this camera is the flash.  The proximity of the lens to the flash means you'll be correcting lots of \"red eye\" on your PC or Mac.  The flash is also very weak in low to medium light situations, and you can't add an external flash to the camera.This camera sometimes fails to start when turning it on, or shuts off after a few seconds on, but turning it off and on again seems to help.  I attribute these glitches to age and abuse due to heavy use rather than poor manufacturing.","Date":"April 25, 2003"}

{"Title":"Almost mature technology","Author":"Ken Zirkel \"Kickstand\"","ReviewID":"R3K8HQQNFG7T4M","Overall":"good","Content":"The Nikon Coolpix 990 represents the point-and-shoot digital technology ALMOST mature. The shutter delay is hardly noticeable, and most images get written to the drive fairly quickly. Batteries almost last a reasonable amount of time. However, the Quicktime movie capability is a little awkward -- no sound -- and the color of the images seems to always be a problem. However, if you're looking to buy a digital point-and-shoot today, this is the camera to buy. The independent, rotational-lens design is brilliant. You can point the thing at yourself and view your self-portrait as you take it, which by itself makes this camera  a standout in my book. Add to that the top-quality optics and dazzling array of features, and this model is the one to beat.Given all that, for the time being I'll stick to my (film-based) Olympus Stylus Epic for most of my shooting on-the-go. The Nikon is too big, too slow, too energy-hungry, and waaay too expensive to go everywhere the way the Olympus does.","Date":"May 15, 2001"}
{"Title":"Battery compartment replacement ... repair at your own risk!","Author":"R. Clark","ReviewID":"R36JFVCZP4UG7X","Overall":"good","Content":"Suffice it to say, the cp990 battery door and battery compartment issues have been established. For me, it was one of the little plastic catches on the battery compartment that failed (broke).  Once the integrity of the tiny plastic catch has been compromised it's either tape-the-door-shut or replace-the-compartment.  I was quoted $120 and $150 for the repair at two respectable camera shops.  In 2006 this camera can/could be had used at approx $200  or less - I would/did NOT pay to have it repaired.  I guess the 'not repairing it' logic would also point to why the cost is so high -- if a camera shop hoses the job, then they'd most likely have to replace the camera.  Luckily I found the 'battery compartment' piece on the big auction site and ordered it, cost approx $29 plus shipping. In reality, what would I have lost if I messed the camera up further?  For the repair all that was required is a good desk lamp, precision screwdrivers, and patience. I won't turn this rating into a tutorial, I like the camera and it was worth the effort to fix it.  Outside the redeye issues, and the toy like battery compartment, this camera beats most 5mp ps cameras hands down.Repair at your own risk - I did!","Date":"March 19, 2006"}
{"Title":"Great in *most* situations, poor in others","Author":"Steve Parrott","ReviewID":"R3HS26Y10VNWXO","Overall":"good","Content":"In daylight, you can get excellant quality photos, but in dim light, it is impossible to get sharp shots without a tripod.  Raising the ISO to anything over 100 will result in lots of ugly noise in the photo.  The built in flash is horrible.  It is good to use as a fill flash in outdoor shadows, but will give poor results as a stand alone flash indoors.  For good indoor shots, I have found the best results using a tripod and the \"slow sync\" flash mode. The shutter speed will be very slow, so any movement of the subject will result in blur.  Again, dim light is this camera's biggest fault.  It will ALWAYS set a SLOW shutter speed, making it impossible to hand hold the camera.  Manually setting a faster speed such as 1/30 will not work, because the camera cannot set a large enough f-stop to allow a proper exposure.  So, in the right conditions, the 990 can take perfect photos, but in night or indoor situations, you will have to really make some carefull settings and use a tripod to get good results.  The macro mode is FANTASTIC. It will take stunning close up shots. I really think that is this camera's greatest asset. The rotating head makes taking close ups in ackward positions a breeze.  Another couple negatives though, the monitor is impossible to see in bright sunlight, turn it off to save power and use the viewfinder.  This brings up the second negative, if you have an accessory lens attached to the head, it will block out your view through the viewfinder.  It looks like Nikon has addressed lots of these problems with the new Cool Pix 5700.  I suggest you spend just a little more money and get the 5700, (with lots more zoom and over 5 megapixels), instead of the 990 / 995.","Date":"July 18, 2002"}

I routinely use the second or third highest resolution setting and I am able to take pictures that have excellent detail and color.

I've used this camera at night to get some good city-scapes (especially considering that I don't have a tripod) and for shots ranging from dreary days in Ireland to sunny mornings in Santa Fe and the camera is great.I picked the brains of camera-philes before purchasing my digicam and Nikon was repeatedly recommended as one of the best cameras in the price range, regardless of extra features (Sony) and higher pixel concentrations (Olympus, HP, Epson).

I've long relied on the quality of Nikon lenses, in business, and am still, after three years,  surprised that the glass in the E990 is no whit inferior,  notwithstanding that it's meant for e consumer marke.The swivel body is to die for. I can't imagine why Nikon discontinued it. It gives both waist-level and eye-level capability.  You can shoot from ground/floor level without lying down, and, to do macro photography without impossible contortions, this is a very useful, innovative feature.I do a lot of macro photography, also photography of small objects indoors, where I use the AC adapter instead of rechargeable batteries.  Outdoors, the very, very long cord of the battery pack is a nuisance, and the NiMH batteries seem to have lost rather a lot of their charge while just lying idle.  So I have two sets.  These batteries are not made by Nikon, of course. On the other hand, I don't know where to assign blame for the fact that the plugs between camera and battery cord and between cord and batteries tend to lose contact; I have to frequently twist then a bit to restore power, and of course the settings are lost and have to be re-made.  This has been true of three different cords and battery packs.All in all, though, I just *like* the E990.  It feels good, works well, gives excellent results. I rather prefer it to my Nikon D70 (eye-level SLR with professional lenses), although each has its advantages and disadvantages - you need both, if you're serious.","Date":"December 7, 2005"}

The built-in speedlight right next to the lens guarantees harsh lighting, big shadows, and red-eye (the 995 isn't much better); and the fact that a thousand-dollar camera doesn't come with a hot shoe is scandalous.But the options are there, not only from Nikon but places like EagleEye; and the number of CoolPix 990 user groups on the Internet guarantee a large group of friends you can call on for help.Once you get through the menu learning curve, the ease of use and quality of the image simply can't be beat.

However, fixing red-eye on your computer is easy, so it's a tolerable defect.2)  Although the camera body rotates, it's not quite as user-friendly as the flip screen that rotates in any direction on the Canon G-2.3)  Resolution.  I always shoot on \"fine\", but still end up with some photos that I'm not crazy about the resolution.  Pictures with lots of detail turn out great, but where there is less detail, you end up seeing the little dots.  Although people say a 3.0 megapixel camera approaches film quality, I disagree. I see the pixelation even on 4X6 prints.Conclusion:  I'll continue to use (and love) my Nikon 990 until I save enough to replace with a 4-5 megapixel camera like the Canon G-3 or Nikon 5000.","Date":"December 11, 2002"}

I've taken about a thousand shots in this time, remarkable since my film camera still has undeveloped rolls from 4 years ago (just too lazy to get it developed). My 3x5 printouts came out surprisingly good, both for baby pix as well as for my office brochure. After extensive research online (including reading all these Amazon reviews) I decided to step up to a multi-megapixel camera, and the 990 has not disappointed. Certainly this is not a point and shoot like my old digital camera. However, it has a nice automatic as well as manual setting; it behaves like a point and shoot if you want it to (and takes amazing shots on this setting). After spending a few days reading the comprehensive manual, I am amazed at the finesse you can now apply to photographs if you have the time and inclination; 8 second exposures, grey scale photos, rapid-fire mode (I get up to 10 shots at 1.5 exposures a second), a macro feature allowing shots as close as 1 inch...it goes on. The size of my photos has jumped from a 72k jpeg to 700+k jpeg for an average shot, and now my hard drive needs upgrading, but thats a different story. I haven't been able to tell the difference between FINE and NORMAL setting at 2048x1056, and hence my 128M Lexar compact flash that I bought gets me about 160 photos per outing.

{"Title":"Among the elite digital cameras in the market right now.","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R204R6QP655TL","Overall":"good","Content":"After a long month of researching cameras, I finally decided to buy this one. If you are seriously considering this camera, look around for prices, as they vary greatly from one place to the other. First of all, while this isn't a true 4.3MP camera, I think it outperforms 3.3 and 3.1MP hands down. THe resolution, color warmths, color accuracy and sharpness is amazing for a camera of this size...or for any digital camera any size. I have had this camera for a month now and I have never been so proud of an electronics purchase...of course I love my Mac too! Here is a list of PROS and CONS:Pros - The retraction of the lens which gets covered by a metal door is excellent. - The flash works surprisingly well. I used the camera in Times Square in New York (for those who don't know where Times Square is), and the faces came out with a good amount of light, while the backround lights of Times Square came out very nicely also. This camera takes VERY impressive night shots. I think it does better when it is set to AUTO than when it is set to NIGHT mode, although you can create some pretty funky shutter delay shots and play with lights and colors. - The Movie mode is great! Sure, it is not broadcast quality, but what did you expect. I think it takes better movies than the Sony Mavicas. - The USB connection is great. The smart media compartment works well too. - YES! You can set a timer to take pics..up to five seconds I think. - Looks like it came from the Matrix - Want flash? Pop it up. Don't want flash, pop it down. It is the easy.No buttons to press, no setting to set. - Many ISO to choose from, as well as Macro - TOP .JPG resolution is great. Don't be fooled that it doesn't save in .tif formats, the pictures are great! And saves space! - Comes with 16MB card, not 8MB like most of the other guys.CONS - The LCD display is difficult to see in bright sunlight, but at least you can use the viewfinder, unlike the Sony Mavica. - The camera KILLS alkalines, even the ultra alkalines. Don't be stupid. Use the NiHM, 4 are included with the camera, but I suggest going to Radio Shack and buying a quick charge charger. It'll same you lots of money and time, as the included charger takes 12 hours, and only holds 2 batteries. - I would've liked to see Fuji use the IBM Microdrive in this unit. With soo many memory hungry applications in this camera (movie capture with sound, high resolution images), even the 64MB card which I bought wasn't enough for a weekend with buddies in NYC.Conclusion: I showed the images of the trip to my boss, who is a hardcore Sony maniac. He was soo stunned by the quality and features, and price and size of the camera that he bought one for himself! You can't go wrong with this camera. I love it! And so do the editor's of Popular Photography magazine, who recently gave this model its highest review about it's color accuracy.","Date":"December 5, 2000"}

The controls are logical and easy to use.  Common  adjustments don't require powering up the LCD * The camera is light and  small enough for a shirt pocket, yet feels very solidly made with its  aluminum magnesium case. * The camera is very fast - no noticable delays  after turn on or after a shot before you can snap the next picture. * No  special expensive batteries needed - just 2 rechargable AA NiMH, NiCd, or  in a pinch standard alkalines * Motion JPEG (Quicktime or with the right  codec AVI) movies - you can shoot about 1 1/2 minutes of 230x240 video and  sound with the included 16MB smart media card (6 mins with the 64MB).  Perfect for sending to grandparents. * very fast and easy picture transfer  and management with USBI'm very pleased with the quality of pictures.  There are a couple of more expensive 2.4 MegaPixel class cameras that have  better lenses, but they have poorer colors than the Fuji.

{"Title":"A Good, Basic Camera","Author":"A Customer","ReviewID":"R269CHU73VELG8","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this after using a Sony Mavica for about six months.  I loved the Mavica, but wanted better quality images.  This camera has filled that bill very well.Is it perfect?  No, I believe Fuji could have done some things better.  I get error messages from my PC when I use the USB port to  transfer images to my computer, but the images do seem to come across  without error.  When I use the viewfinder, I see only about 75% of the  image that's photographed.  That is, the viewfinder trims off a pretty good  sized border.  Some have referred to this as a 4.7 meg camera.  Perhaps so,  but the quality is about the same as a 2.5 meg camera.The camera is  small.  For someone with big hands, such as me, this took some adjusting  to.  Once I adapted, the controls became easy to use.Photos are stored  in jpeg format, so there's some loss of quality in the image, but I take  all my shots in fine mode, and haven't noticed any problems.  I've not seen  any of the jaggies that I'd occasionally see in the Mavica images.All  images are taken and stored in color.  I wish the camera had a B&W  mode, just to save on disk space when I'm working on that kind of  image.Even so, it does quite a good job, in my opinion. This  is a basic camera.  You won't be able to connect lenses or filters to it.  About the only thing that you'll wish to buy afterward is some additional  memory and perhaps a carrying case.  I suspect that, for most buyers, this  camera will take care of all of their needs.  Others may use it for a  while, and then decide to go on to bigger and better things.  I sold my  Mavica FD-83 when I bought this camera.  I'll probably keep this one when I  move on to a bigger and better product.","Date":"July 6, 2000"}
{"Title":"Tiny camera performs like a champ!","Author":"Sean Kelly \"Consultant\"","ReviewID":"R3BOA4LOXSU7PJ","Overall":"good","Content":"It's hard to imagine that such a tiny little camera can take brilliant 2400 by 1800 full color digital images, yet it does so extremely well!I bought my Fujifilm FinePix 4700 mostly for my impending baby.  As a simple,  point-and-shoot digital camera, it fits the bill perfectly.  A fully  automatic mode with a preview screen lets you compose great-looking shots  quickly.  Despite the camera's size, its zoom lens pops out to a 108mm (3x)  view.  (And you can digital zoom at lower resolutions.)  There's even a  popup flash on top.If you want a more controlled shot than the fully  automatic mode or the preprogrammed portrait, night scene, or scenery  modes, you can go to a fully manual mode, enabling you to adjust ISO  \"film\" sensitivity, metering, exposure value, white balance,  macro mode, and even manual focus.Depending on how much memory you've  put in (it uses Compact Flash cards), you can even take a minute long or so  JPEG movie, complete with sound.  A tiny built-in speaker lets you watch  and hear the movie you just took on the camera itself.By plugging a  computer's USB cable into the camera, you can transfer pictures and movies  out of it at high speed.  The camera includes Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home  edition for editing.  Or you can view your masterworks on a TV screen using  the A/V output port and cable that comes in the box.What really  impresses me is how Fujifilm fit all these features into such a small  package.  The camera's light and fits into the palm of my hand just right.  Holding the camera takes a little getting used to, and you do have to be  careful not to cover the autofocus transducer-thingamajig.  But it's not  uncomfortable at all.When turning the camera off, the lens retreats into  the body of the unit and a metal cover slides into place, protecting it  quite effectively.The only major drawback is the battery usage.  It's  quite easy to burn through its two AA-sized rechargeable NiMH batteries  before you've even filled up a 32MB flash card.  Leaving the LCD display  screen off and using the viewfinder instead definitely helps prolong  battery life.  The box luckily includes four such batteries (plus a  charger), so you can carry a spare set with you, or recharge two batteries  while using the other two.Overall, I'm blown away at how far  miniaturization technology has progressed.  The features and performance of  the camera are great---but to have all that in such a tiny box is  absolutely amazing.","Date":"June 21, 2000"}

{"Title":"Digital photography is really here now!","Author":"J. Fraser","ReviewID":"R28JV5CCD02AGO","Overall":"good","Content":"If you are looking for a quality digital camera that can replace replace a 35MM at less the $1000.00, you found it. The picture quality is just fantastic, it is very easy to use, is loaded with features and the USB and  smartmedia storage disks make it painless for photo storage and transfer. I  was looking for a 2+ mega pixel camera (this unit is 4.7!) that was small  in size (about 1 1/4in think and could fit in my pocket), had USB and  smartmedia disk storage, a 2\" LCD screen, a optical view finder, an optical  zoom lens for less then $1000.00.  This is one impressive camera. I have  been experimenting with it for about a week now and have tested all its  many modes. The ONLY weakness where a high end 35mm can out shine this unit  is in very high-speed action. I was not able to adjust the shutter speed to  freeze the blades of a spinning fan, I could do this w/ my 35mm. BUT IN  EVERY OTHER CATEGORY I think this unit is easier to use and produces as  good if not better then most 35mm. I am not kidding.  A few notes:  Batteries last a lot longer then other dig cameras I have seen due to power  saving features,  The optical zoom is nice (3:1) It has a night mode that  takes great night shots. It has a nice macro mode (for close up photgraphy)  A portrait mode that has great skintones. A landscape mode that config's  the unit to take great outdoor very sharp images of scenery.  Built in  flash autotimer and alot more! Short movie capability w/sound! It is a  small AVI format movie (only 320X200) but it is great for a short clip to  email to a friend. It very easy to use. It has easy to use software for  your PC.2 LCD panels, a 2\" one for photo viewing and a circular one  for camera operation.Modes of operation. There are 3, fine normal and  basic. Use normal for just about everything, except a special shot that you  know you plan to blow up then go to fine. The normal mode is nearly as  clear and sharp as the fine except when enlarged. In a 4X6 test series I  took no one could tell the difference between the 3 pictures. The Default  is set at 2400X1800 \"file size\" (2400x1800, 1280X960, and 640X480 are the  choices (IMO use 2400x1800) and quality set to normal. This is the best  choice IMO (normal w 2400X1800 file size) for most if not all shots. In  this mode you can store 77 photos on a 64MB disk! (19 on the 16 MB) (In  basic mode from 180-996 images on a 64mb disk) Transfering the photos to  your computer is a snap. When you plug in the USB cable to you camera the  software fires up and you see the pics. Click and drag to where you want  them. I also bought the Snadisk smartmeadia reader so I don't have to use  the camera to transfer them. (Looks like a mouse with a 2 in slit in it)  These smart media storage cards are the way to go..the y are about the size  of a large postage stamp and about that thick too and hold 64 MB. I can't  say how pleased I am with this product. I think this is the first real step  in consumer digital cameras that will rival any 35mm out there.  To date I  have been printing them on my HpR80 office jet (an ink jet) w/ suprisingly  good results. My next purchace will be a dedicated dye sub photo printer.  But the inkjet does a great job. Viewing the photos on the computer screen  or on a big screen TV is a blast.  Go digital, it is the way to go... it  really is quite good now and reasonably priced.Good luck to you.

{"Title":"Fuji FinePix 4700 vs. Canon Elph","Author":"Erwin Grellmann","ReviewID":"R23DRC7VRH0UCI","Overall":"good","Content":"The FujiFilm FinePix 4700 zoom is my second FujiFilm digital camera.  I took a close look at the new small and cute Canon Elph.  But the Elph gives up some important features for the same price.  Make no mistake, this is a fine camera and I am awed by the flexible features packed into such a small size.  Here are some features that I have have found invaluable:PROS o The Photograph Mode Dial feature is one step up from a fully auto point and shoot camera.  I am very impressed by the Portrait, Landscape and especially the Night Scene modes.  They are optimized settings and take exceptional pictures under those conditions. I found it easy to twist the dial, shoot, then compare results taken in different modes.  Dramatic.  For me this is the single most useful feature of this camera, its implementation is easy and effective.o Generally, for film speeds of ISO 100 you have to keep the camera very still for sharp pictures.  So a faster film speed as this FinePix camera has is a big advantage. This camera has a base film speed of ISO 200 and settable up to ISO 800. (Canon is ISO 100)o Get as large a LCD display as possible.  This one has a 2 inch screen (vs. 1.5 for Canon).  If you use the LCD for framing a shot or to review a shot taken, a nice large screen is worth the extra size in a the camera.o Stay away from unique batteries.  More than once I have wanted to take that \"must have picture\" only to have forgotten my spare batteries in the car, or to find that they were dead.  AA size batteries can be found anywhere, even if you have to take a flashlight appart to get that important shot.  These NiH batteries are 1/10 the cost of Canon's Li batteries.I have owned the FinePix 4700 for one month now.  The FinePix is much more efficient in battery use compared to the older FujiFilm DX-10.  FinPix uses 2 batteries vs. the 4 in the DX-10, and lasts just as long.  This makes it possible for the camera to be lighter by 2 batteries.o The 3X zoom is very nice.  Canon has only 2x (although in Japan I have now seen an Elph with 3x zoom).oSmartMedia seems to be more available and prices are coming down.  If you haven't already discovered, SmartMedia with a PCMCIA adapter is the perfect replacement for floppy discs, especially if you own a notebook computer.CONS oThe viewfinder is small, especially if you wear glasses.  Using the veiwfinder does save on battery power, so hopefully FujiFilm will address this in the next model.  Then I will give it 5 stars.o After one month of heavy use, the Auto Focus does not work and the camera is broken.  I have been unable to get through the busy phone lines at Fuji Film in Edison NJ.  At the moment I have given up trying to get through.  Fortuantely, I live in Japan where service is still first class and the local Fuji dealer accepted my camera for warranty repair.  It will take a month ;-(  Take notice Fuji Photo Film America!  Answer your phone lines and voice messages!","Date":"May 19, 2001"}

{"Title":"A Few Problems","Author":"Benjamin Fenster","ReviewID":"R3MYOZ1S0EN1LO","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had a few problems (some more important than others) after purchasing this camera, which lead me to eventually return it.  CONS* I had trouble getting the auto-focus to work properly.  Since nobody else has mentioned this, it could have been a problem with my specific unit, or even user error.  Still, only one in five pictuers I took came out clear.* The overall controls seem awkward.  The zoom control (up and down arrows) is difficult to use while looking through the viewfinder.  To grip the camera properly, I found my fingers occasionally in the way of the lens.  * The USB software did not function as well as some others.  The contents of the camera's SmartMedia card are represented as a removable disk (with a letter) under Windows.  However, it denies any modification access.  You can view your pictures, but you can only delete them from the camera itself.* Interpolated images.  I was disappointed to learn, even before I bought the camera, that the high advertised resolution is NOT the real resolution of the pictures.  The resolution is still fairly high, but don't use the advertised numbers as your guide to making the purchase.PROSThe reasons I chose this camera originally withstand the points against it.* The LCD screen can easily be switched on and off with a single button to save battery life.* AA NiMH batteries.  No super-expensive unique battery that can only be bought from the manufactuer.  Regular alkeline AA batteries will work (though they die VERY quickly), and NiMH AAs are cheap.* Very compact.  This camera fits easily into a jacket pocket. Once the lens retracts, and the cover flips shut (which is fun if nothing else), the body has no obstructions and the lens is out of harm's way.* Overall ease of use.  While the bells and whistles may be lacking (no Black & White mode, etc), they aren't necessary anyway -- those things can always be done with software later.  This lack of superfluous options makes the menus easy to navigate, and adjustments easy to make.* No games with the flash.  Turning off the flash on some cameras means hitting a button to cycle through ten different settings before \"Off\" finally appears.  Here, it's much more obvious.  If the flash is open, it's on.  If it's closed, it's not.","Date":"March 18, 2001"}

The weaknesses are: 1) It eats batteries. The first accessory I bought was a MAHA MH-C204F home/car charge and two sets of 1600mAh batteries. The second was the AC adapter for use while dumping the pix to the computer. 2) There is significant barrel distortion on wide angle shots. This is widely reported, but should not be considered a show stopper. 3)The AVI files generated in movie mode appear to be non-standard. After installing the Fuji S/W to my machine, Windows Media Player handled these just fine. When sent to relatives (who didn't have the Fuji software), WMP could not play the video and provided only sound.

My biggest concern was support under NT 2000.  None of the product info or reviews mentioned support for the NT OS, but it works like a champ.  NT2000 usb drivers were even included in on the cdrom!  I had the camera up and running in <5min and was transferring outstanding pictures to my NT2000 laptop in <10min.  A brief reading of the manual unlocked all of the camera's secrets.  The camera provides for control over both pixel count (640x480 to 2400x1800) and image quality (basic-normal-fine).  With the included 16MB chip you get ~49 images at 1200x960 using normal quality -which look great!  However, image count drops to 8 at highest settings.  Definitely thinking about a 32 or 64 MB chip.  Red-eye reduction flash is a little sketchy, still some residual effect.  Only real disappointment is poor battery life when using alkaline batteries -REALLY BAD.. I barely was able to run the set up and have enough power for 4 or 5 flash pictures.  Good thing they included 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries (80-230 shots depending on flash and LCD usage).

The camera comes with two sets of rechargeable batteries and the recharger.  Very nice.  But for me, other than the quality of the pictures, I love the size.  I bought the camera for the family, and I don't want to lug a bulky Nikon, so this fits the bill.The only problems that I have experienced are due to the size.  The optical viewfinder is small.  The flash needs to be popped up manually even in auto mode.  That really annoys me since my wife continues to forget to pop up the flash and we get dark pictures.  Hey Fuji, auto should mean auto on the flash too.  Also, you got to watch how your right hand grabs the camera so that you don't cover the auto focus or light reader eye.Obviously, with five stars I am very happy with the camera.  If your not getting good pictures don't blame the camera.","Date":"October 13, 2000"}

{"Title":"Great camera","Author":"Jeff","ReviewID":"R324IBBAWOGZ36","Overall":"good","Content":"I did alot of research before buying this camera. I was looking for a camera that had three specific qualities. 1)Easy to use for the beginner. 2) Produce quality 8' x 10\" photos. 3) Movie mode. This little Fuji fits the bill in all three categories and on top of that the price is very reasonable compared to other cameras and I definitely like its distinct, compact look. To me, it has an oldtime European look to it. This camera produces very high quality photos using its highest setting. I would prefer a stronger flash for indoor shots but for outdoor shots its perfect. The colors on outdoor shots are just amazing. This little camera only uses (2) AA batteries instead of the typical 4. The batteries do last surprisingly long. I was able to click off 36 high resolution shots with flash and LCD screen on and power lasted over an hour. The batteries that come with it are excellent at 1600 mah. I also picked up some rechargeable Monster Cable AA's from 800.com, they are 1800mah and are very long lasting. NOTE: I couldnt wait to for the batteries to charge when i got the camera so I used some duracells. I went through a 4 pack in 10 minutes. Only use these batteries in dire emergency situations. They are not meant to be used for digital camera no matter how much they claim to be. At first the controls on this camera seem complex, but once you actually get into using it you find out how logical the placement of the controls are. Just spend one hour with the manual and camera and you will be an expert on this camera. Also, you can hook this camera up to your TV and play the movie back and do a slide show of all the pictures. I did this for family members at a get together, took orders of who wanted which picture and then printed them out so they would have instant photos of only the ones they wanted. Big WOW factor there! I am sure there are better digital cameras out there, but if you are looking for the criteria that I listed and want get it at a great price this is the one.","Date":"September 19, 2001"}

Can't take panorama pics.  Quite a pity because the wider angle is especially useful for interior shots.  And the Panorama would also be great to have - more zoom would be useful - a little more closeup would be useful in macro shots.Other points: - don't get fooled by the so-called 4.7mil pixels - this is an extrapolation and represents no real increase in resolution over the approx. 2.3 mil pixels available.  A less deceiving name for the camera would be FinePix 2300. - the leather pouch would be greatly improved if it had a little space to comfortable accept 2 extra batteries, since an extra set should always be on hand when travelling.-  get the larger sized memory card and get an extra one too (fits in the leather pouch nicely).I use my FinePix 4700 to document my work.  It sees almost daily use.  I am very satisfied with the product.  When travelling I have 2 memory cards and can take up to about 50 high resolution photos (which I rarely use), about 300 or so medium resolution photos (which I usually use) and something like 1000 or so low resolution photos (which I rarely use since they are VERY low resolution)  If they could get a wider angle and panorama then it would suit my purposes exactly.  As it is I am nevertheless quite satisfied with my purchase.","Date":"May 19, 2001"}

My wife has been ambivalent about digitals because she wanted quality shots like she gets from her 35 milimeter camera.  The quality I get from this camera (and I am a picture taking amateur) is at least as good as she gets with her quality 35.  The batteries do a good job compared to my other digital camera.  I would suggest the 64 mg memory card.  With it, you get 38 highest res pictures at a time.  Also, the usb transfer is so much similar that what I had with my old digital.  My son bought the high end Sony (the fd95) and this Fuji takes as good pictures, the difference is that he gets 10x zoom.

{"Title":"Great pick","Author":"ARuslan \"mdljukka\"","ReviewID":"R3KY3JUVAAK2ZC","Overall":"good","Content":"I purchased this camera about two weeks ago. It's an awesome camera.  The picture quality is very, very good.  A friend of mine had this camera for about a year, and he recomended it to me.  I've been taking pictures with it around the city and at some clubs, it's great. The movie option is very cool, you can capture up to 80 seconds of the movie.  The nightscene feature is also very cool.  I took some pictures at a club, where the lighting was very low, and if there's light's in the background, or moving light, the picture comes out with a cool trail effect. It also has a manual mode.  The only thing about this camera is that the batteries run out kind of fast, but what can you do it's a high powered device.  So if I was going to go out I'd take an extra set of batteries with me.  This camera takes 2 1450 mah, or 2 1600 mah NI-MH rechargable batteries, it also takes NI-CD batteries.  Monster Cable makes 1800 Mah batteries, but when I called Fuji, they said that those weren't recomended to use with this camera.  You can get a charger set with 4 batteries ...  Also in the manual and on the box it says that this camera accepts up to 64Mb SmartMedia Card, but on here in the accesories it says that you can go up to 128mb, and Viking support center said the same thing. I purchased the 128mb card and it works just fine. At 1280x960 resolution with fine quality I can take 204 pictures, which is more then enought.  I would also recomend getting a SmartMedia Card reader which conects through the USB port.  That way you don't drain the batteries when you're transfering pictures from the card to your computer, and it also works faster.  For the price I'd say that this is the best choice.","Date":"April 6, 2002"}
{"Title":"I have had no regrets about buying this camera","Author":"\"isaacforman\"","ReviewID":"R38MEHZM9YCE2A","Overall":"good","Content":"I shopped around for my first digital camera (also looking at Canon and Olympus models) with the following primary criteria: ease of portability, quality of images, and ease of use.Firstly, this camera is a great size, making it easy to carry wherever you go. I wanted the freedom to take photos without processing delays and costs, and also the freedom to carry a camera wherever and whenever, and it has certainly been possible with the 4700z. The zoom lens retracts and is automatically covered when you turn off the camera, making a lens cap and/or strap completely unnecessary. The flash also pops down when not in use.The quality of the photos produced by the 4700z is exceptional. You will immediately notice (especially on a nice day outside) the vibrant colours and clarity. I have had success with the macro mode and the optical zoom also (remember not to factor digital zoom into your purchasing decision with *any* camera).The camera is also very easy to use. You can hand the camera to someone, point out a few buttons (mostly zoom and save/discard), and they'll have no problem in taking a great photo.Buy an extra storage card or two (I have 2 32's and the 16 which came with the camera), and take both sets of batteries when you go out for the day. When taking photos at sporting events, try to get closer to the action rather than relying on the zoom - when you zoom, you accentuate player movement, and also your own movement. Also, try using it with a tripod - I've taken some good photos during the day or at night with a tripod.Finally, the two problems I've discovered in 6 months with the camera have done nothing to put me off it. I would happily make the purchase again if given the opportunity. The two problems have been: left-most button around the secondary LCD requires more force to push than the others; and the flash often needs a nudge to pop it up. Both pretty minor issues.","Date":"July 17, 2001"}

Both the Fuji and the Leica models had an internally chargeable battery which lasted well and was very convenient. The 4700 requires AA batteries-if you use the screen, they will not last long. I've also found frequent and vexing problems with the camera not wanting to accept smartmedia cards it previously used. This is intermitent but annoying enough to warrant testing a card before you rely on it. The camera is a nice weight and produces great pictures but I am not sure that it's a quantum leap over its predecessor.","Date":"December 19, 2000"}

I shoot about 50 rolls of film per year and my regular equipment includes top of the line Nikon's and Canon's cameras and lenses.  So my expectations of picture quality from a digital camera were pretty high before I bought the Fuji 4700.  My decision to buy Fuji was based on high resolution spec of 4.3 Megapixels. I was very pleasantly surprised with Fuji 4700.  Everything I was looking for in terms of camera's feature and capabilities is there and more.  The greatest surprise came however when I printed my first photos.  I have a relatively inexpensive Canon Photo Printer BJC-8200.  Unless you look real close (like 10 inches or closer) the quality of 8x10 prints is virtually indistinguishable from analogs.  I found out that the key to great picture quality is to use high quality glossy paper -- I use the same paper that came with the Canon printer (I think it is made or marketed by Canon).  I had mixed results with other brands although I am sure there must be some brands that are equaly good or even better.  Bottom line, I love Fuji 4700.  It is fun to use and gives great results. If I had to improve one thing it would be the curved handle on the front of the camera--it does not feel 100% comfortable but given everythinhg else, it is a minor inconvenience. I guess Fuji recognized that and fixed it in the 4800 model.","Date":"June 14, 2001"}

This is certainly not a true 4MP camera... look at it as a 3MP camera that makes bigger files.I needed to find the manual, since I was borrowing the camera from a friend. I went to fujifilm.com, and was really disappointed with the offering -- I couldn't even find a _mention_ of this camera, let alone drivers/software/manuals!

Any photos taken above the 1280x960 (1.2 Megapixels) resolution are extremely grainy and pixilated.  Also, the shutter speed is extremely slow, and if the speed is increased grainy pixilation becomes even more apparent.  The camera drains batteries quickly when the LCD is not used, but when it is on the batteries do not even last an hour.  I have had this camera for a little over two years and it is now almost completely unusable.  Bright colored dots appear throughout the pictures, and the camera shuts off randomly during use.  Granted, these problems did not exist when the camera was new, but the camera should still be reliable after two years of light use.Though it takes terrible pictures and drains the life out of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries rapidly, the camera is well built and has a beautiful LCD.  The metal case feels strong, sturdy, and expensive.  The LCD produces vibrant, colorful images and is among the best I have seen.  The camera's menus are also fairly intuitive.Overall, much better deals can be found in the market than the 4700.","Date":"April 14, 2003"}

I used it for about a year, and it quit. I must admit that I had dropped it hard once, and it had just gone through a mountain approach during a high wind advisory (I take it in my light plane). So, I really can't fault the camera. Turned out it needed a new flash board. Took 5 weeks and [amt] after sending it to Fuji NJ. I don't consider that bad service, and something you should think about before buying an off-brand asian wonder. I doubt any corner camera shop is doing to do much to a digital beyond cleaning.2400x1800 is great for digital zooming later. Or, for printing, but it is impolite for sharing photographs due to the upload time. It has 9 resolution settings. Three for # of pixels and within them three compression settings. I set it on 1280x960 and average compression. This gives me 99 pics on the supplied 32meg card, about 250k per pic, and great picture quality. The only criticism I can think of is that the flash stinks. I like a bounce flash, and this doesn't have the option. Red eye galore. You have to edit it out later.

The box for this camera states that it needs Windows 98, (not supported for Windows 95).  The USB drivers that come with the software won't work on Windows 95 (tried it with on an HP pavillion computer). Ended up buying a smartmedia card adapter that allows the card to be read from the floppy drive which works great....Also the camera is a little akward to hold, its not in the shape of a normal camera. and the lens zoom button is not the easiest to use either (it is on the back of the camera). The microphone for the AVI recording is on the left side of the camera, and its pretty easy to accidentally put your hand over it if holding the camera with both hands.The batteries also take a long time to recharge - 13 hours. Fortunately it came with two sets.The initial AVI clips we made didn't look that good when  viewed in quicktime 4.0, but when they played in the windows media player, it looked a lot better.  I didn't have time to figure out why.This camera was chosen for the better low light sensitivity (ISO 800) and the 3x optical zoom.

I sent it back to Fuji when it was under warranty because it had a hard time recognizing the SmartMedia card. They fixed it promptly.

Now it is acting up again.Now I love the results I get from the camera, but I wish it would work when I want it to instead of when it wants to.I'm about to send it in for repair under the warranty from the previous repair.

I got it as a gift couple of months after it was showcased.  I will rate this camera according to when it was bought and according to the present time 2004.When Bought:  Great picture quality, has many different settings from basic to fine and also different options of resolutions from 640 to 2400. The manual mode is good, it allows you to control white balance, allows for manual zoom, and changing the ISO up to 800.  I mostly take pictures in this mode since the color is more true once you have adjusted these settings.  I think all settings stay saved for the exception of the manual focus which you would have to reactivate everytime you turn the camera on.  The video mode is great in full light yet it gives very low quality vidios if the indoor lighting is not bright.At the Present:I believe there are better cameras out there, yet this camera at its present price might still be attractive. The issue of focus error starting happening to me only after the camera slipped off of my hands once and landed on the ground. Eversince them I get this message everyonce in a while. The biggest disadvantage of this camera in my opinion is the speed of the shutter. It is quite slow.","Date":"December 15, 2004"}

The intangible qualities are what make this camera an excellent choice for anyone simply wanting great quality pictures from a camera that operates like a film camera, but has all the advantages of a digital camera.- The pictures are excellent (especially the color), although low-light pictures are a little grainier than I would like.- The flash is VERY powerful considering the camera's small size.- Stainless steel body seems very durable, feels solid in your hand- Camera operates very fast: turning on/off, menu navigation, shutter/autofocus delay, flash recharge, switching modes. In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of any digital camera, and most don't have it!- Battery life is excellent! Only 2 AA's easily last for a day of normal use. I usually get at least 2 days out of them. Fuji has really shown their excellence in this area... the power saving features have obviously made a huge difference.Conclusion: If you want a: 3X optical zoom, pocket-sized camera, for everyday use, that works like a film camera (i.e. very easy to use, and fast), feels like a high-quality product (not a cheap plastic toy), you MUST get this camera. You WON'T be dissapointed.WARNING: If you want extensive manual control, DO NOT get this camera. You WILL be dissapointed....","Date":"May 2, 2002"}

It is easy to use for a beginner but has enough advanced features that I don't anticipate that the average home / business user would outgrow it quickly.The menus are easy to navigate, even for someone not particularly adept at with the conventional functionalities of a digital camera.  In spite of its small size, it is sturdy and seems pretty durable.Definitely upgrade to a 64MB SmartMedia card and order extra batteries as well.  Battery life is acceptable but they do have a tendency to run down rather quickly (especially if the LCD screen is used a lot.)  The batteries are relatively inexpensive and it's nice that in a pinch, Alkaline AA batteries could be used.To date, I've taken over 200 photographs with the camera.  The performance is good and the cyle times between photographs and for power up are above average for a camera in this price range.  Printed photographs are excellent, even with a relatively low-end color inkjet printer utilizing photo paper.Besides the quality, it is just plain fun to use and generally gets a \"wow.. cool camera\" comment from others.If you are considering a digital camera, this one should be on your short list, especially at the current price.","Date":"June 20, 2001"}
{"Title":"Just another review","Author":"mitek","ReviewID":"R11SD95T4J67MG","Overall":"good","Content":"I did an extensive research on this camera, and had a chance to experiment with it for quite a while. The final impression is fairly positive, the good sides clearly outweight the weaker ones.Here is the summary.POSITIVE =================================================== * Very small and compact size, small weight (~300 gramm with batteries) * Excellent color representation. Colors are warm and natural. Probably, best color representation of any compact digital camera on the market. * Fast and 100% painless transition of images to computer; there is absolutely no need to by any additional accessories to that end. Camera mounts itself as a removable drive in Windows Explorer as soon as you plug it in, and you just copy the jpeg files. * Flash does not pop up by itself; no need to play \"outsmart the flash\" game. If you need to disable it, just close it up. * Uses smartmedia cards, which is the most compact media to date (less than 1mm thick) * All small features are extremely well thought-out, as always the case with Japanese companies; and yes, it does have a self-timer and tripod mounting screw.NEGATIVE ==================================================== * The main problem of this camera (and I have not seen this in any prior reviews here) is not the lower-than-advertized resolution (which is huge even as it is, at least equivalent to 2.5+ megapixels), but a so-called \"barrel distortion\". This effect is only present when the camera is set at the widest angle (that is, no zoom). Put simply, this means that if you're looking at a vertical wall at the widest angle, and this wall happens to be at the very side of a viewfinder, it will appear as somewhat swallen outside of the picture. All digital cameras are said to have this effect, but when I looked to check it on this camera, I was able to notice it clearly. If you zoom in, it disappears. Again, I was fully aware of this when I bought the camera, yet that did not affect my choice. * Picture quality is somewhat lower than it could be for this pixel count; it is certainly lower than advertised 4.3 megapixels. * no \"black & white\" mode; * monitor drains power quickly. however, keep in mind that it uses only 2 AA batteries instead of 4, as most of other digital cameras do, and maybe that's why this drain is more pronounced.CONCLUSION ================================================== Seems to be one of the best compact cameras on the market to-date. However, if I were a professional photographer, I'd get Fuji professional camera, Fuji Finepix S1 Pro for ... For everything other than professional photography, this camera is excellent.","Date":"November 21, 2000"}

{"Title":"This camera has made me into a photo junkie","Author":"Brad Larson","ReviewID":"R2ILCPE62S3NX","Overall":"good","Content":"Before I saw this family of cameras in action, I didn't have an interest in digital photography.  The company I worked for bought a C-3030 and I was called over to set it up.  As I worked with it, I became more and more impressed.  The USB connection is blazingly fast (assuming you're using Win95/98/2000), the LCD is sharp and bright, and the processing of the pictures themselves is very fast.  Then I actually looked at a picture taken at 2048x1536 and my jaw dropped.  Using just the defaults for white balance, ISO, shutter, etc., the picture it took of a hedge of flowers was amazing.  Both the C-3030 and C-3000 have outstanding picture quality due to the well-designed Olympus optics and let you manually set just about everything for that perfect picture. I searched around and bought a C-3000 because the greater onboard memory buffer of the C-3030 wasn't all that important to me, I didn't need Photoshop LE, and I was going to buy a 64 MB card for it anyway.  The $200 you save, in my opinion, makes this a much better buy than the C-3030. One photography magazine labeled the C-3030 \"the camera for nerds\" due to all the options you can set.  If you're into it, this camera will let you explore photography as an art form.  I'm still learning what I can do with it, but it's already produced some beautiful photos. One recommendation I have is to buy a CD burner.  Photo albums on CD save a mess of hard drive space and are a great way to permanently store pictures and then show them off to friends. Finally, there is one feature that I don't see mentioned much elsewhere.  In the panorama mode, if you take pictures in a complete 360, the Camedia software lets you create Quicktime VR movies out of them.  This lets you truly express the feeling of being at a place.  I did one at Lambeau Field and you do feel like you're in the crowd when viewing it.","Date":"October 8, 2000"}

{"Title":"Terrific camera!  Perfect for the advanced amateur","Author":"P. Hoegel \"average joe\"","ReviewID":"R2PNPRT56ZTWAJ","Overall":"good","Content":"I was in the process of researching digital cameras, when I very unexpectedly got this one for Christmas.  I haven't been disappointed--it is a terrific camera!The controls are wonderfully logical, and are not plagued by cryptic ideographs.  The range of creative control will impress anyone with even a modest background in photography.  The C-3000 lets you go from no-brainer point-and-shoot mode to complete exposure, metering, focus and flash control and back to dummy mode in seconds.  Even better, you can customize the default settings, letting you have the exact baseline settings you want immediately following power on.But the real gems are the Olympus optics and CCD.  I have made dozens of absolutely gorgeous 8x10 and even a few 11x14 prints that are nearly indistinguishable from high quality 35mm prints. Why only four stars?  Because my only serious gripe is the batteries, specifically if you're forced to use anything other than lithums.  I've tried both nickel metal hydride rechargeable and standard alkalines, and it drains them both very quickly.  However, you will conserve a lot of power if you make your default flash setting \"off\", so that you're not charging the flash every time you power on.  Additionally, the Olympus lithium battery packs are very hard to find, but I've found that Energizer AA photo lithiums work just as well, and are often cheaper.As someone with a serious amateur interest in photography for nearly 20 years, I realized recently that the C-3000 has become my primary camera for everything from quick party snaps to that once-in-a-lifetime shot of sunrise on Mt. Fuji.  Meanwhile, both my 35mm P&S; and my Nikon SLR rig are collecting dust.  This camera is an excellent value:  beautiful pictures, easy to use, excellent creative control, and very rugged aluminum construction, a big plus over other manufacturers like Sony.Bottom line:  this is a great camera, and the C-3000 is the best value in the C-30X0 product line.  The only camera I'd recommend instead is the C-4040, which gets you the 4 megapixel CCD, but if you rarely make prints bigger than 8x10.","Date":"August 15, 2001"}

It is a great piece of gem as an upgrade replacement to my older point-and-shoot digital camera that I bought years ago and now I always carry it around with my SLR. Many good things about this camera have been said here and so I try to be concise.For less than $..., you get:1. Great optics and resolution: 8 elements in 6 groups, aspherical lens equivalent to 32-96mm zoom lens on 35mm camera, f2.8-11; 3.3 megapixel CCD producing image resolution up to 2048 x 1536 (Olympus always has excellent optics and image reproduction)2. 1.8\" LCD display and optical viewfinder3. Macro mode for close-up shooting, minimum range: 0.8\"4. Supports Panoramic feature (w/ Olympus SmartMedia only)5. Supports full program, aperature priority and shutter priority auto exposure as well as manual exposure; auto exposure bracketing; spot metering; exposure compensation6. Allows manual focusing7. Able to capture QuickTime movie (15fps) with sound8. IR remote control9. aluminum casting!A few features that I wish it had:1. a faster lens ... like f2.0 in the C-2040 or the f1.8 in C-30402. a larger memory buffer to allow a faster shooting sequence and a longer movie capture time3. a bigger memory card! the 8MB card that it comes with is nowhere near sufficient!4. a more standard lens diameter ... the 43mm threaded lens mount (w/ the CLA-1 adapter) is such an odd size! and you can't put a filter right on the CLA-1 adapter because the lens tube will hit the filter when the camera is powered up!5. a better design: the extended lens with a step-up ring and filter will obstruct the object from the viewfinder!","Date":"October 5, 2001"}

I did extensive research comparing the top cameras, read countless reviews on photo websites, consumer reviews, etc.  The other cameras that I was seriously considering was the coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70.  I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a bargain.  If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography, the C3000 has almost as much as the 990.  It has manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual focus, and exposure bracketing to name a few.  But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well.  You get a rapid fire mode, which, though not blazingly fast, is still respectable and even increases quite a bit with focus set to manual.  Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio clip, kind of an audio labeling.  There other cameras out there, notably the Cannon Powershot G1, which has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable for taking candid shots.  But the G1 has image problems(Chromatic Aberations and noise), as does the 990(redeye).  All these cameras have plusses and minuses, but with one of the top-rated images and top-rated feature-set with a price that's a couple hundred lower than most of the top cameras, the C3000 really stands out!","Date":"December 14, 2000"}

Well, obviously I chose the C-3000 and I could not have made a better decision.  All of the features and extras are just the beginning of this cameras greatness.  I was absolutely stunned by the incredible quality of the pictures that this camera produces.  With a good printer and some photo paper, you won't even notice the difference between homemade pictures and professionally developed film pictures.  Even large 8 X 10 pictures are crystal clear with this cam.  When you first use this cam, you may be confused by the many options you have, but after a day or two of playing around and reading the instruction book, you will be able to make the most out of every photo.  If you are one of those people who absolutely hate auto focus, don't worry.  It has it.  It also allows you to control aperture and shutter speed, allowing you to leave the shutter open for a full 16 seconds, allowing you to create amazing effects.  By the second night I had the cam, I produced a neat looking picture of a car with the appearance of the lights tailing behind it thanks to the control you have of shutter speed and flashing.  If you just want simplicity, the C-3000 can do that too.  If you are not into being in control of your photos, just point and click.  If you do not like your photo, you can immediately view and delete it to avoid wasted space.  I can't even estimate how much film I have lost because of bad pictures that I wish I could take back.  If scenery is your thing, then you will love the panoramic feature.  With the aid of a tripod, you can make full 360 degree panoramics.  You take each part of the panoramic individually with the aid of the veiwfinder, and the computer software will combine the pictures allowing you to create a true panoramic, not the fake kind found in Advanced Photo System cameras.  If taking a panoramic seems to complicated for you, then just switch it over to movie mode.  Depending on the memory you have, you can record anywhere from 30 second to 10 minute video clips, all with sound.  If I were to continue listing all of the features, my hands would fall off from typing too much.  Whether you are an avid photographer looking for complete control of every shot or a person looking for a simple digital cam that takes great pictures, this cam is perfect for you.  There is one question about this camera that I do not feel that I could answer.  What can't the C-3000 do???","Date":"February 10, 2001"}
{"Title":"Remarkable achievement","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R18J5E534CA68L","Overall":"good","Content":"Incredibly versatile with superb pictures and excellent controls for real photo bugs who want to do manual overrides using aperture or speed prioritization.  USB transfer is very fast.Only two criticisms: The lens cap is very easily dislodged.  I have spent an inordinate amount of time looking for it with several close calls!  Also you can't put a filter directly on the lens to protect it.  This is the most expensive camera I've ever bought and the only one I can't protect with a filter.There is an answer:  Olympus makes a kit that contains a lens cap retainer and filter + adapter.  It also contains a number of other things I had already bought (very good rechargeable batteries, a case, AC adapter).  It costs $200.  You can't buy the lens cap retainer or filter/holder separately!","Date":"October 7, 2000"}
{"Title":"Can't do much better than this","Author":"Stephen M Van Pelt","ReviewID":"R2Z027K7W2AXLP","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had the C3000 for a month now and couldn't be happier (unless they supplied a useful size memory card). You need to get at least 32 meg of memory if you can't have a computer around all the time. Important note:  the panarama feature is really great but only works with olympus memory. Go  figure. It takes great ambient light photos and the flash is easy to  control, allowing you to moderate the amount of flash. The only drawback I  can think of is it cannot focus much closer than eight inches. The Nikon  990 has it beat there. The takes pictures faster than most cameras that I  tried and boots up pretty quickly.The lens cap knocks off easily so get  one of those lens cap tethers. This camera is super easy and takes an  outstanding picture in the default mode but do yourself a favor and read  the manual. This is one powerful pup. Also rechargable LiMH batteries are a  must. You can fill a 32 meg card easily on one charge. If the price of the  3030 had been as low as it is now I would have sprung for the difference.  Hey, don't waste you time with low res cameras. I recommend this one. You  can't go wrong.","Date":"July 25, 2000"}

After filling a 64 megabyte chip with vacation pictures, was very apprehensive when downloading to my computer since I had not tried my camera before the trip (which could have been disasterous!).  All that worrying in vain!  Each picture looked better than the last.  The resolution is so good I was able to zoom in to the smallest part of a picture and clearly see as well as if I had used a high power lens.  Second most important to the high quality pictures is how easy the camera is to use.  One read through the manual and I was on my way--with absolutely no problems!  And, it is so small, I am able to pack it in a little case and slip into my purse. 5 Stars is not enough!","Date":"October 24, 2000"}

The pictures we have taken with look great, both on printed photos (local printer and through online service) and on screen.

{"Title":"Great Pics !!!! Excellent Camera !","Author":"\"twister4533\"","ReviewID":"R3HCZR9TU3ZF4R","Overall":"good","Content":"The Olympus C-3000 (now priced ...) is a wonderful buy. In its league it is by far the best digital camera. Its  got a resolution of 3.34 MP. Other camera's with the same resolution cost a lot more. This camera is easy to use, and prints wonderful pictures. I had an HP C315 xi and I was disappointed because the pictures looked grainy but  not in this one, the pics in this one are better than a  film camera. This camera also does MPEG movies with sound. I love that feature. It has pretty decent LCD. Watch out though, though ! If you buy this camera from not a reputed store, you might find a couple of dead pixels on your LCD screen. Buy it from a reputed store such as AMAZON or (...)so that you get value for your money. This camera comes with the cables that let you connect it to your television and view a slide show of all the pictures. It does not come with a carrying case. It comes with a remote control that allows you to be part of all the pictures you are taking (which is a good thing !). You can connect this camera to your USB port of your computer (make sure you've got a USB port in your pc and you've got Windows 95 b, otherwise this may not work for you.It comes with the Camedia Software which although not the best, will do okay. I recommend buying a memory card of atleast 64 MB. (Try (website) for a cheap card). This helps a lot. The card that comes with the computer is only 8 MB. You'll run out of this easily. There are other cameras which are very expensive and I do not recommend those. I think this camera is simply wonderful. One more thing, you will definitely need rechargeable NiMH batteries and a recharger, the batteries provided run out sooooooo easily.","Date":"June 10, 2001"}
{"Title":"Unbelievable picture quality and ease of use","Author":"Tim Foecke","ReviewID":"R2JQYC3WG6Q4DT","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought this one from Ritz camera...just before a 2 week trip to the UK.  I also invested in a larger (64 MB) memory card and a PCMCIA card reader adapter so I could download to my PC.  Great picture quality!  Unbelievable depth of field.  Movie feature is cute, but obviously no substitute for a video camera.I would have given this 5 stars but for a few small, nagging things that were troublesome during running around the UK:-  the stock memory card (8 MB) is stupidly small.  16MB is the absolute minimum that should be offered.  My new 64 MB card held 80 pictures at the HQ setting, and these pictures turned out very nice.-  though the camera is small when looking at it from the front, it is pudgy in the thickness direction.  This makes taking it out of your pocket and/or the carry case difficult and frustrating.-  as with others, I found the lens cap to be plain dumb.  A little plastic, clip-on thing that gets knocked off really easily when removing the camera from the case, and gets lost in your pocket between pictures.  Some sort of a built-in cap would be SO much nicer.-  if you forget to take the cap off before you turn it on, even to download pictures, the telescoping lens gets trapped and probably grinds and slips gears.  I did this a couple of times, and I hope I didn't damage the mechanism-  the LCD on the back of the camera is nice, but gets scratched when the camera swings back and forth when you have it slung around your neck.  The plastic covering the LCD is so soft that the plastic buttons on my shirt left little scratches!Don't get me wrong, I love this camera and would buy it again.  But the above items seem easy to improve and make this a 5 star device.","Date":"April 16, 2001"}

It is small and compact and all the buttons are laid out in a manner that one can understand. I place my photos on the internet and find that with the included 8 mb card it will take 24 beautiful photographs in the \"SQ1\" opton in jpeg format. In the \"SQ2\" mode, it will take 81 photos in jpeg format with your 8 mb card. The photos are as sharp and clear of any I have ever seen. If you use the C3000 for prints, you will need a minimum of a 64 to a 128 mg card because of the needed space. The camera now comes with a nice \"Olympus\" lens cap. One should use chargeable batteries and a battery charger for this camera. The C3000 does not come with a carrying case but the photos you get will more than make up for the small investment required in a case. In short, I highly recommend this wonderful camera.","Date":"August 4, 2001"}

It wasn't in the driver list, so I contacted Olympus.This was my response (read - \"doesn't work - we're not doing anything abount it\")\"\"My answer for Windows ME Users:  DO NOT ATTACH THE CAMERA TO THE USB PORT UNTIL YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE.

Aside from the fact that it got great reviews, I have to honestly say this camera takes fantastic photos and is easy to use especially for a dummy like me.  A few minor quirks.  Lens cap will not stay on and easy to get lost.  8meg smartcard comes with the camera and is a total waste of time.  I would recommend no less that 32megs and I bought a 64 and it will hold 84 photos in the HQ mode.  The LED viewer on the back of the camera has no cover and can be stratched quite easily.

I love the size of it and the textured grip, it really feels secure in your hand.  The huge variety of resolution modes is more than you will ever need but is a great assest.  The only way this camera could be improved is if it was a SLR and lose the digital zoom (it only causes distortion anyway, something I hated about the Kodaks I tried).  You may find the cameras that take the 3 1/2\" floppy disks convenient but when it comes to quality you better get the olympus!

{"Title":"Great Camera, Hate the Lens Cap","Author":"Fred A.","ReviewID":"R4H8UI079PS2Q","Overall":"good","Content":"I've had this camera for about a week now. It takes great pictures and is very easy to use -  even the menus which you will get familiar with upon regular use. Get an extra Smartmedia card because they only give you an 8mb card with the camera. Also, get a battery recharger (Rayovac's 1-hour recharger works great with their 1600NiMH batteries and for me, they have charged in less than an hour!). The reason I gave this great camera four-stars is because of the lens cap. If you forget to remove the lens-cap when you turn the camera on, you will hear an ugly noise that reminds you to take it off and you HAVE TO remove the lens cap. Also, the lens cap is not attached to the camera itself upon removal so you run the risk of losing it (I have misplaced mine about three times now. Luckily I have found it each time!). Aside from the lens cap issue, I think this is a fantastic camera to welcome an individual to the \"filmless\"  world. I have always wanted to take-up photography as a hobby (I am a beginner) but the cost of film and development always stopped me. With this cool camera (plus an HP Photosmart 1215 printer which I have) I have broken that barrier. Enjoy!","Date":"October 30, 2001"}

Quality when printed on 8x10 photo paper has fooled professional photographers I've shown them to without them really studying the print.  Exceptional sharpness and capable in low light situations without a flash or elapsed time shots.  Remote allows shots only when camera is facing you and only has utility if you are trying to get yourself into the photo.  30 second movies are fairly high quality, but just a bonus as few would buy the camera for that feature.  Have taken close to 10,000 images with the camera and would replace it with a similar Olympus model if it did finally crap out.  Have owned over 10 digital cameras through the last 3 years used for personal and business applications.  This camera is the same as the 3030 with half of the buffer memory, but can still fire shots nearly as quickly as you wish.

I put the setting at P for automatic and the pictures at 3.3 megapixel quality make perfect printed photos; even at 8x10 size.  I would highly recommend this great product to anyone who wants the ability to use fully automatic or programmable modes.  It even records QuickTime movies, although that's probably the only drawback to me as I've not been successful in creating any good ones. For a great value and excellent quallity, with USB capability, I'd recommend the Olympus, hands down.","Date":"December 26, 2001"}
{"Title":"Overall, a great camera for the price!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RM7D6ADHJRRU3","Overall":"good","Content":"I got my C-3000 for Xmas last year, and have been using it regularly for almost a year.Some things I like about it:-It takes very high resolution pictures.  This is especially useful if you are a novice such as myself and need to liberally crop to have a nice picture (you won't end up with a grainy mess).-It's small and easy to hold.-It has quicktime video (which I didn't think I would use, but certainly has come in handy).-It is fairly quick to recover between shots.-It takes AA rechargeable batteries, and standard memory cards- both easy to get and not overly expensive.-It has a nifty remote control.-The Camedia software is very easy to use, and I have had no problem at all uploading pictures from the camera using the usb cable included.Some things that I don't like:-It makes a horrible grinding noise if you turn it on w/o taking the lens cover off!-It is unwieldy to page through menus to control aperture/focal length settings.  Dial control of this (like on regular cameras) would be a huge bonus.-If you buy the adapter lens kit, you must remove it everytime you shut your camera off (because the fitting is on the retractable lens)  Not very convenient at all.Overall, I have been extremely happy with this camera, especially for the price.","Date":"December 12, 2001"}

I just upload to Ofoto.com and print any pictures I want professionally developed at a fraction of the cost I used to pay, as I only develop the good ones!  Also great for e-mailing!

It took all of about 10 minutes to get it up and running including installation of the software.  One caution about the software is that it won't work on an upgrade of Windows 95 to Windows 98.  It will work just fine if you upgraded to 98 SE.  I would recommend a higher capacity memory card; the 8MB is not really useable for much.  The lens cap, as many other users have reported, is a pain.  The best thing about the whole unit is that it is so user friendly.  I am truly an amateur photgrapher, and in no time, I was taking great pictures.  The menus are easy to understand, and you can quickly make adjustments.  By customizing the set-up, you can save some battery life.","Date":"November 24, 2001"}

Although I did much research, I wasn't sure if an absolute beginner like me would be able to use the camera well. After a few months with the camera, I can tell you that I could not be happier.  When set to 'point and shoot', the camera makes me look like I know what I'm doing.  The picture quality is excellent.  I'm  also starting to get into the advanced features, and the manual settings allow a great deal of flexibility.  On another note, I did have to send the camera in for repair (the problem may have even been my fault).  I was going on a trip in a couple of weeks, and desperately wanted the camera for it, but I didn't think there was any way they could get it back to me.  Well, I'm happy to say they got it back to me in less than 2 weeks, in time for my trip.  Thanks Olympus!My only quibbles are the lens cap (not attached) and the tiny 8 MB card that comes with the camera.  You will want at least a 32 MB card for seriuos photo excursions.Buy the camera. you won't be disappointed!","Date":"May 1, 2001"}
{"Title":"Still going strong","Author":"Steve Pickering \"Steve\"","ReviewID":"R3FE9BI98O7O94","Overall":"good","Content":"Having been a veteran of the SLR scene, I waited a long time to buy a digital camera. I have now had my C-3000 for 3 years and it is still performing excellently. Only 3.3 megapxels? No problem. Unless you are printing poster sized pictures, who needs more? (unless you really want to get SLR quality, which I believe is now possible). True, this was expensive when I bought it (equivalent of $1,000), but the number of photos I have taken has saved me this in processing fees. It is easy to use and if you are daring enough has enough interesting advanced features. Once I figured out how to depress the button slightly for autofocusing etc, I could do panning shots.The downside: Yes, the lens cap does tend to get lost, but my brother has a later version with string attached. The LCD panel gets scratched, but I have not noticed diminished monitor quality. Olympus tell you not to use it outside in cold weather because of condensation problems. Does this not apply to all electronics, or is it a problem with this camera?I am shortly going to purchase a 128mb card, as they are now cheap. I can't find any limitations on card size, so I hope it is OK. The CAMEDIA software is OK, but the USB connection is a little sensitive. PICASA does not pick up this camera at all-it senses otyher digitals.Overall, I think in its class this is a classic, just like the Olympus OM-1/10 was a classic SLR. If you can pick one up second-hand, do so. Just check that LCD screen.","Date":"October 1, 2004"}

It is easy to use, has wonderful picture clarity potential, an average optical and digital zoom.  With the 3x optical zoom and the 2.5x digital zoom (which there are plenty of mega-pixels to support) You have a combined 5.5 zoom capability, more than eneough for the average person. If you use a good photo-quality printer, such as the hp photo series you will be extremely well pleased with quality of your pictures.  Does have the drawback of only coming with a 8mb smartmedia card, but the prices of memory cards are dropping weekly, and you should be able to get a 128mb card for as low as 89.99.

I have other Olympic cams that this was not a problem.. the lens cap thing is a terrible ..it mounts to the housing that holds the lens tube instead of to the lens tube itself so one is bound (if they use lens caps) to leave it on and start the cam and hear horrible grinding noises as the tube exends and bumps against the cap .. I pity anyone who lives in a dusty environment that buys this... the unnecessary extensions and contractions of the exposed lens tube (every time you want to check a setting) will not make for a long life .. a cheap 3.3 ...cheaply made!

I even bought a different model but exchanged it for the C3000 due to the overwhelming reviews and first hand experience.  My first camera was a Canon AE1 so it was important to have flexibility with aperature settings, lighting, focus, etc.  The colors of my photos are vibrant and warm.  I've even shot some unbelievable b/w photos, which I printed and framed (8x10).  Friends can't believe that they were taken by a digital camera.  The only downside to this and many of the digital cameras is the shooting range is short.  SLR photographers...don't expect to get those great close-ups with this camera unless your subject is right there.  And the shutter speed is slow so you won't be taking many action shots with this camera.I use a 128 mb card and can shoot 70 shots per card with the SHQ setting.  Once the card is full, I transfer the shots to a CD, reformat the card and I'm ready to shoot again.

But the best aspect of this product is that it takes terrific pictures, even in the simplest-to-use modes.  One thing I feared about digital was the quality of the photo's composition - digital tends to have a reputation for producing a \"cold\" picture.  The results from this camera, however, were warm with a great color balance and good depth.  I have printed quality 5x7s and 8x10s.  The camera is easy to understand and simple to use.

{"Title":"Great Value ,  I love this Camera .. Dave a Pro Photographer","Author":"David Cruikshank","ReviewID":"R2Y0LUO3USD1V5","Overall":"good","Content":"I searched all over the Web, and in stores before I bought my Olympus C3000Z.  I can tell you from experience you can look everywhere, but for a great price from a reliable source, just stop here and buy from Amazon. I am a professional photographer who wanted a digital camera for last minute headshots, web use, and to become more knowledgeable about digital photography.  I knew that Olympus made excellent digital cameras, so I narrowed my search on their brand.  I also knew I wanted 3.3 Megapixles.I have hade mine for a about a month now, and I'm very pleased. Through a combination of an Olympus accesory cable ( the FLCB04 ) and some wiring of my own ( I'm a techie at heart ) I have used my C3000 with my studio strobes, and also a Nikon SB series flash, with excellent results.  I love the instant feedback, and not worrying about how much film I'm using.  I know I have only scratched the surface of this cameras capabilities.  I do suggest if you buy one that you buy the biggest Smartmedia card you can afford,  I plan on getting a 128MB, and that you also buy 2 sets of NIMH batteries and a charger.  This camera like all digital cameras will just chew through normal alkeline cells if you use the LCD display for any length of time.  When I went to the Photo East Show in NYC this past November, the Olympus rep told me that this camera would not Sync with Studio flash.  Well I can tell you Yes it does.  I will warn you, you need to use a flash with a low sync voltage or use a Radio slave to protect the sync circuits in the camera, but it does work.  For me it has been like discovering Photography all over again.  You can do things you just can't do with a normal film camera such as change the speed ( ISO ) for each frame if you want to.  Switch on the fly from color, to Sepia, to B&W;, and best of all, see right then and there if you got the shot you were after.  My only complaints are 1) the shutter lag that is part of all sub $2000 digital cameras, and the time it take to write the file to the card if you shoot in Hi-Res TIFF format.  But this is a (...) camera, next year I'll go for the E20.  In closing for the amount of money I spent, I have no regrets.","Date":"November 28, 2001"}

{"Title":"Good value and  specification","Author":"Peter Jones","ReviewID":"R25GOAUO31IMVY","Overall":"good","Content":"I bought the C3000, on the strength of having used the c2020 at work, where we've had ten cameras for about six months now with no reported faults or complaints. The C3000 was the natural choice of camera for me, mainly because of the full manual facility that it offers as well as a 9Mb TIFF option.My only gripe about the camera is that the external flash socket has been changed from the standard two pin pc connector to the dedicated 5 pin type for the Olympus dedicated flashgun ( not even the same fitting as the older T32 type) The C2020 works very well using studio flash equipment and is ideal for checking out lighting st ups for large format photography. No chance with the 3000 however.....anyway I guess that's a small price to pay, and the majority of users wouldn't want to use external flash.One point about the software, every time the panarama option was chosen on the computer, it bombed out. Full marks to Olympus, 12 hours after e-mailing them with the symptom, they sent a patch to fix the problem.To round off, a great (not so little) camera for the money, there are smaller lighter ones on the market that fit in the pocket easier, but nothing to match the options offered by the C3000....Just hope I feel the same way about it in six months!","Date":"January 11, 2002"}

Went w/the 3000zoom because [another store] had it for 10% off their everyday price ... and the PNY Smart Media 128meg cards were on sale for TWO for ...! They also threw in a PNY USB Smart Media reader for FREE! How could I refuse?On to the camera - I took about 50 pictures at the second-highest resolution (SHQ) and they were higher resolution than my laptop video card & monitor could handle because they looked oversaturated and had a cross-hatch pattern. Took out the SM card, plugged it into my USB reader, downloaded them to my desktop PC & manipulated the images w/MGI Photosuite 3. This program can resize the images, enhance the image w/a one-button click and do just about anything you want with the pictures.Love the images, but still NO 35mm comparison yet. My complaints about the camera regard the setups. Kinda time-consuming to bracket the shot and set it up properly. No where near a logical set-up. Guess I'll have the cliff-divers in Acapulco wait in mid-air while I set this ... up. Would be much more beneficial to have pre-programmed buttons to save time. Pretty funky that the extension tube sticks out for EVERYTHING, including picture review. No rechargeable batteries - How come? Even my bottom-of-the-barrel Mavica came w/a charger and NiMH. Smart Media is cheap, that's good. I'll use the 8meg included card as a back-up to my 256 megs of storage. I'll still keep my 35mm, because Olympus doesn't have it right yet.","Date":"January 19, 2002"}

I had previously written a glowing review of the camera (and complained then about the bugginess of the software), but feel totally let down by the company now, which puts it in a different category.The \"Zoombrowser\" software this product comes with is, far and away, the worst software product I have running on my computer.  It's buggy, has bad error messages, performs slowly, doesn't play well with Windows file directories.  Sometimes I spend 10-15 minutes trying to get my computer (a 6-month old Dell laptop, Windows XP, plenty of memory, processing speed, etc...we're not talking an old computer problem) to recognize the camera so that I can download my pictures from the camera to my laptop.This week, I'm in Anaheim, CA to take my family to Disneyland.  I need to take the last batch of pictures off the camera so we can take pictures at Disneyland.  I got an error message when launching the Zoombrowser program (the incredibly friendly \"The Error E_Fail occurred in the program\", with only the \"OK\" button to push.  No additional information.)I waited until the next morning when I can talk to someone in customer service.  I called in, went through 3-4 menu prompts , and got to a human in about 3 minutes, which was better than previous times.  I'm told by the technical support person that I \"need to uninstall and re-install the program, and re-load all my images.  Do you have your original Zoombrowser CD?\"  I explained that I was travelling, and that I didn't carry all the software I have with me, what were my other options?Here's the killer:  he said there weren't any!  I explained that I was connected to a high-speed Internet connection at the hotel, surely there must be a way that I could get the program.  The rep explained that they don't make the program available because they sell it to others, and others would download it.  This went on for 10 minutes.  I asked to speak to someone else who could give me some options, or explain why I couldn't download a copy of the program, and he refused to pass me along.  I asked for the address of the person who runs the photography business unit at Canon, and he said he had no idea, that person was in Japan.  No help whatsoever.This is about the fourth or fifth time the Zoombrowser software has died on me in 18 months.  It's a just a piece of junk.  I love the camera, but would actually buy another product if it's still being sold with Zoombrowser software (I have version 2.2.0.16).  Last I checked about 6 months ago, it's still what's being sold with the camera.  Run somewhere else!I'll be using one of those disposable cameras at Disneyland tomorrow.

But then not too long after I purchased this camera, I \"occasionally\" can not turn the camera off:  that is,  when I press the off button, the zoom len would not contract.  I have to use brute force to push the len in.  I also have a problem with blurred images every now and then.  After I contacted the Canon support person, they told me that the len is defective and I have to send in for repair.  BTW,  I have the camera for a grand total of six months and I have only used it for 5 occasions.Another problem with this camera is that it does not fair very well if the lighting is not sufficent, even with the built in flash.  If you use automatic mode and if you want to take outdoor night view, be prepared that you might not get what you want.One thing I can say positive about this camera, besides the obvious ultra light weight advantage, is that its software (image viewer) is fairly easy to use.

Based on this experience, when I started shopping for a higher resolution camera, I gave Kodak serious consideration. The DC4800 was the latest in the Kodak line at the time. I ended up buying this camera due to my previous experience with Kodak and a trade-in offer for my old camera. I wish I had kept my old camera! This camera does take great photos -- if you only ever take photos in bright outdoor light!! The flash is TOTALLY inadequite for the camera, if I shoot 20 pics indoors, I am lucky if 2 come out usable...the others are too blurry. The bluriness is caused by either low light conditions, or the subject being closer than 3-4 feet from the camera. ... My suggestion? Do NOT buy this camera!

What a disappointment it was when the  first of three came. Yes I had three and all three were returned due to  results mainly but poor design also enetered into the decision. First it is  to small, 2nd has a lens cap that cannot be attached to the camera even  though it has two holes in the lens cap. Batteries are expensive and don't  due any more than the AA Recharable's the 290 used. Flash is a pop up flash  which is just one other thing you have to remember to activate if needed  instead of being intergrated like the 290 was. But the real bottom line is  the results -they are not as good as the 290. I had taken a week before  with the 290 pictures of my new car. I took the same picture with the 4800  and then printed both off with the Epson 900. The 290 print was far better  than the 4800 and that is not acceptable especially with a 3.1 res. I now  own a Epson 3000Z which is built along the lines of an SLR and the results  are what I expected from the 4800. The Sierra Image software included is  great.

Most high and low numbers (f/stops and lens sizes in mm) are exaggerated.  The only thing it does well is take pictures of fruit bowls and [use] up electricity.  It has no freeze frame due to excessive high available light required by the CCD. Blurred shots at the picture element level are the norm, sharpness and pixelation are rarely seen do to the low resolution and magnification of the CCD,which likes to run hot.  The camera only takes one jpeg mega byte in ideal light. It will produce a tiff nine mega byte that is of lesser quality (saturation artifacts).  Using this logica million dollars is actually nine million, right ?Without f/1.8 your better off with one of their disposables.

Out-of-focus when pictures is  taking indoor under normal environment with or without flash. This is due  to the new design of the auto-focusing function, which uses a diode (CD) to  detect distance and exposure, unlike the previous models that were using  Infrared. The CD technology is fine as many SLRs do use diodes to assist AF  and Exposure, however, there are faults in the current design that leads to  picture taken indoor completely out-of-focus.2. The software available  to be used in the computer for picture handling has a problem with the  Delete function, which does not work properly. It works in one instance and  fail in another.

Pictures selected for printing, for example, suddenly are eliminated.When I E-Mailed Kodak about these issues, customer service said \"I suspect that you will find similar hold times if you purchase a competitors product, since we're pretty much all in the same boat.\"  It seems that Kodak is shooting for pretty low goals in providing service.The battery life is extremely short so add the price of new batteries to the purchase price.","Date":"May 6, 2001"}

However,  there are several major problems that makes DC4800 almost unuseable: 1. The  flash is so weak that you cannot really use it for good indoor result.  2.  Under a good indoor lighting environment,the camera cannot auto focus  properly when zoom in. The subjust is always out of focus and the subjusts  behind are clear.  3. When adjusting the optical zoom to the telephoto  setting, the digital zoom automatically comes on without any warning. The  zoom is very annoying to use. 4.

It was very user friendly, and the picture quality was better than I had expected. However, after less than 3 months of regular use, the camera began to read brand new AA Alkaline batteries as dead. Eventually, it failed all together, and wiped out all the pictures stored on the memory card in the camera. After numerous lengthy conversations with several Kodak representatives (most of whom insisted I must be putting dead batteries into the camera, that there couldnt be a problem with the camera itself), I was provided with a replacement camera...which failed right out of the box. The manual says the camera will operate with a \"variety of AA Batteries\", but this was not the case in my situation. I am disappointed with the camera, and the company. I thought that I was investing in a quality item with a company that would stand behind its product, but I was mistaken.

And when it was working it kept asking me to format the card. I take 5 pictures and by the way, you have to wait like 10 seconds between shots (too long), so I take the 5 shots and then the light on the camera which tells you the reader is reading the card says it MUST format the card again.

It's light, easy to use, fast, and straight forward.  The lens is protected by a sliding door.  This is kind of cool.  You open the sliding door to turn the camera on in \"capture\" mode.  When you open the sliding door, a motor extends the lens out from the body about .5 inches.  This is all great.  HOWEVER, to power off the camera and return to \"review\" mode, you slide the door part-way shut.  The problem is, if you're not extremely careful, the door jams into the extended lens, and the lens _skids_ back into the body against the door.  Once the lens is fully retracted, you can close the door completely.I gave it two stars because all the goodness of this camera will be lost when your lens motor burns out because the motorized lens was rubbing against the door.  *sigh*The Camera's great, but it's door/power switch design has much to be desired.","Date":"November 28, 2000"}

I have used the camera without problem for a long time , \"BUT\" (see below).  Note to those having problems with battery life - stop using the screen and just use the optical viewfinder except for really close up shots.  That's what eats the batteries.  I have gotten 250+ shots (more than one 128MB card's worth of pictures at high res) on a single recharge of my NiMH recharagable batteries.  Maybe 50% of the time with flash.  But avoiding the use of the screen at all costs!  Oh, I also really like the fact that the flash is manual;  newer versions are completely automatic, and I don't like that at all.Now the \"BUT\": like several other folk, my camera just stopped working after 2 years of faithful service.  I was debating sending it in, but my brother-in-law and I played with the battery compartment a little and, by holding the door partly open (but all batteries in contact) it would work.  Looks like age and plastics and tenuous connections, since, having taking it apart and prodded gently at some of the connectors, it now sometimes works.  I suspect the flex of the plastic body is too much over time.  The method of turning on the camera is just too mechanical.Since the price of \"official\" repair is a large percentage the price of a new camera, I won't go that route.  But I will open it up again and look more closely with a loop to see if there are any obvious solder cracks or other loose connections.  Hey, it's long out of warrantee.  Anyone with more experience with this problem (all three of you) holler.  The very high cost of repair and lack of DIY information on the Olympus site are why I give my otherwise awesome little camera just two stars.","Date":"April 29, 2003"}

{"Title":"Poor design, quirky operation, excellent pictures","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R11U46JWCTHXCZ","Overall":"bad","Content":"First the good news: the picture quality is excellent with this camera. Even on the middle grade mode, clarity, and color are pretty remarkable. Now the not so good news: the designers need to just plain go back to school. Here is the short list: 1. Quirky software: Camedia is poorly laid out, and does not work dependably each time. Sometimes you can download pictures, other times no go, the clock just runs forever. I've switched the software to different computers, restarted cam, restarted computers, no consistency. It ran once for half and hour with no download. Worse, the programmers weren't bright enough to put an escape function when this happens, which means you have force quit Camedia to try again. When the camera does mount on your desktop successfully, the file names are nonsensical. What is \"DCIM\" or \"IMOLYM\"? The programmers must have been in brain jail not to think of a more user friendly way to name the files on your camera. The controls for rotation, enlargement, etc. are crude but they do work, though poorly. One would think that the software engineers would adopt more user friendly conventions ala Adobe Acrobat or Photoshop, industry standard conventions at this point. 2. Shoddy construction: from top to bottom, nearly every moving part of this camera seems on the verge of breaking, when used normally. Many reviewers have mentioned the cover, so I won't repeat this comment. The battery compartment cover design is awful, you truly feel that you may damage it permanently, simply by closing it with batteries loaded. The outport cover, (this is where the output lines for connecting to a TV or PC are located) This is held on my a tiny flimsy looking rubbery hinge. Scary. However, good news: the flash mem card cover IS sturdy! 3. Ergonomics: again, the designers need to wake up and smell the coffee. Really! One control that you will find yourself using over and over is the monitor button (turns on and off the little LCD monitor in the back). This button is located in an area that is just awkward to access repeatedly. Try it, you can do it, but it's not a natural movement or location. Another button frequently used is the \"menu\" button. The designers locate this button right next to the monitor button. Same shape and almost same icon. The result, one has to be careful which button to press, they are so similar. Hey guys, how about a different shape, or color? Or a different icon. Geeez, come on! 4. The control functions on the monitor are complex, but fairly workable with practice. Still, there are many features and selections, and one wonders why it's not laid out to be more user friendly. Conclusion: I know this cam has gotten good reviews here, but I think that the reviewers are either much brighter then myself, or very easy to please. I tend to think the latter.","Date":"March 25, 2001"}

{"Title":"Inexpensive, but flash and design frustrate overall","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RHU6YEB3RX4N3","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera is relatively inexpensive, but it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Battery life, flash charging time, image processing time, and poor design all conspire to make this a frustrating item.Battery Life:  The only time this camera works as it should (i.e., flash charges in a reasonable time, LCD can be used, etc.) is when used with superior (read \"expensive\") batteries.  There are no rechargeable power options, and when sending photos to your PC, do not attempt to use any power cord but the one HP sells (for a hefty price) or else you run the very real risk of frying the camera.Design/Ergonomics:  The camera's design is very poorly executed.  It is difficult to hold the camera steadily without placing your fingers over the lens; consequently one is forced to hold the camera in an awkward way.  The viewfinder is not well aligned, and has no depth (i.e., your view out the viewfinder can change a good deal as you slide your eye from one side to the other).  Finally, the trigger button has a poor feeling--it's requires that you press down too long.Flash Charging:  As noted above, with anything but the best batteries, the flash will take a ridiculous amount of time to charge up:  upto 25 or 30 seconds.  I've missed many a photographic opportunities waiting for the flash to warm up.  Furthermore the camera's default setting upon powering on is with the flash enabled, and changing that setting takes several seconds too.Images:  This camera does produce good images in most light (although it tends to overplay reds in low light, and underplay reds outdoors).  However the time required to process an image between one snapshot and the next is sometimes somewhat slow.Price:  Price is the only real strong point for this unit.  In retrospect I would have opted up for something more, especially considering that the price of digital cameras seems to be dropping $50 or so every six months.","Date":"October 23, 2001"}

First, it eats up batteries faster then anything I've seen.  So I decided to buy rechargeable batteries for it - only to find out after taking a closer look at the manual that THIS CAMERA DOES NOT SUPPORT RECHARABLES.  It gives no real explanation as to why and HP keeps suggesting that you buy energizer e2s (the kind that shipped with the camera.)  Im a little suspicious that this may be a marketing scheme on energizers behalf. Second, It only comes with a 4mb flash card which isnt enough (it will only store 5 high quality photos)  When I bought a 32mb card for it, THE CAMERA WENT DEAD and I had to get a replacement.  HP stated to me on their forum that the camera seems to randomly do this when upgrading the card. Finally, the software that comes with the camera is so idiot-proof that it is absolutly worthless.  It has almost no editing functions and can't even resize the photo for printing. The camera design is just really bad overall.

{"Title":"A bug in the software will break the camera","Author":"Amy G. Rogers \"lomga\"","ReviewID":"R1R1WOAGRP3BJN","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera has two very bad problems.  First, it goes through batteries like they're going out of style. Several other reviews have advised using rechargeable batteries, but in fact, that's a very bad option with this model. The user manual doesn't explain why, but on page 47 it says \"do not use rechargeable batteries.\" I researched this a little - rechargeable batteries get too hot, putting the camera's innards at risk of melting.  More importantly, any use of rechargeable batteries will void the service warranty. A voided service warranty would be bad under any circumstances, but it's especially bad in this case, because this particular camera is more likely to break than many others; there is a bug in its  software.There are two ways to delete pictures from the CF card. You can use the camera itself, or you can use your PC when you have the camera connected. The bug comes into play if you use your PC to delete pictures - you run the risk of \"toasting\" the camera's firmware. \"Toasting\" sounds bad, doesn't it? It is indeed very bad - the cost of repairing a \"toasted\" camera is much greater than the original price of the camera. (Meaning greater than the price of the camera when it was sold new two years ago.)  Cameras under the service warranty are simply replaced, but if the service warranty has expired or is void, the customer must pay.This is a well-known defect; in fact, it is one of the most-discussed problems involving the HP 215 on HP's \"Support Forums.\" The original post dates back to September 19, 2001.I was fortunate; my camera was still under warranty when it broke.  I had an extremely difficult time with HP customer service, but eventually I did convince them to send a replacement.The replacement camera is adequate, but that's about it.  The on/off switch is poorly designed.  It takes a delicate touch to properly turn the camera off, and I've lost count of the number of times I've accidentally left it on and returned to find the batteries dead.The focus & shoot function is aggravating - to \"focus\" you must gently depress the button half way, and then you must wait for a signal before you can actually take the picture.Judging the camera functioning as it was designed, I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars.  With the software bug and HP's lousy customer service added in, it really doesn't deserve any stars at all!","Date":"March 9, 2004"}

Most times we wanted to use the camera, we needed to switch out batteries first. It would be cheaper to get a better camera and save the money on electricity or batteries. There is also a long delay from the time you push the button until the time the picture is taken, so you can forget about catching kids at the right moment. To make it even more difficult, what you see in the view finder is not neccessarily what is in the picture. Many heads have been cut off in pictures from this camera. I just bought a Kodak digital camera to replace this, and it is fantastic; none of these problems. I don't have anything good to say about this camera. I got it when it first came out a few years ago, so it wasn't even cheap at the time.","Date":"November 28, 2004"}

The person I talked to at tech support asked 5 questions prased differantly about when I bought the camera (if it was in warenty perriod). After answering correctly on the first 4 questions I said it was in 2000 instead of 2001 and I was immediatly transfered to someone who was going to take my information to bill me (it was early in the morning and I made a mistake!). I told the guy that is was withing the past year. I told him it was last summer. That is the most recent summer ago.

I must, however, update the information and recommend that consumers avoid the HP 215.My camera died after only six months of operation, and from innate design/production flaws.  That was when I found out that HP does everything it can to discourage customers from reaching a customer service representative or getting HP to honor their warranty -- it was one of the more horrific experiences I've had with a vendor.I won't bore you with the long details but it took many hours of my time sitting on a 900 number (my dime -- they have no toll free numers) just to get HP to admit the camera was broken.  After a long battle, they allowed me to send in my broken camera for replacement.  They sent me someone else's used and broken camera.  This cycle repeated four times, with HP continuously sending me broken cameras in the mail and waiting for me to give up.  It took an email to the CEO to finally get a working product.  That's just not right.For several years, I was employed to purchase, maintain, and repair all computer equipment for my department.  HP used to make wonderful, durable products and used to have great technical support (especially the documentation).  Things have changed, however, so caveat emptor!Since I purchased this camera, many more great, cheap digital cameras have come out on the market.

The first problems I had was it would not save any pictures I took.

Highest on my disappointment list would be the software package and lack of good documentation. Second would be the consturction of a camera specifically for AA sized cell usage without providing for the use of rechargeables which 95% of the consumer base would wish to use.Suspected is that this will be a throw-a-way. I'll use it till it breaks and then throw it away. That may be sooner than later. The last \"unusual\" glitch were photos taken taking up space on the memory card yet not showing images upon viewback. Another nice software conflict was the requirement to delete images on the memory card after uploading so the next batch on the card could be uploaded (large memory card).[Update 5-6/02] This has worked out better than orginally expected but not enough to change the rating. By removing batteries between longer periods of inactivity battey life is extended and the performance is acceptable.  Biggest complaint now is that the screen has always been too dim to use outdoors.  But combined with the Photosmart 100 and printing right off the memory cards, the output is surpriningly solid for the price.The software/camera interface issues and battery problem which should be a product strength, combine to suggest one read a lot more prior to securing any digital camera product.

The picture quality is as good as can be expected on 1.3 mega pixels.  The ease of use is marginal (it usually takes a minute to explain how to use it to someone else).  But the problem I incurred was HP's customer support.  It was abysmal.  It clearly labeled support for Windows XP on the box, yet when connected to an XP machine, it didn't recognize the device.  It warns you that it has not been XP approved.  After seeing this, I figured I could just get on HP's website and download some new drivers...wrong.  They wanted [money] US to ship a CD out with the new drivers (no option to just download them, by the way).  I could be mistaken, but I see something severely wrong with that.  After visiting a few forums about such a subject, I heard that people who did buy the CD had to have it in their computer anytime they wanted to upload pictures to it.  Eventually, I just installed the drivers despite the warning.  There haven't been any noticeable side effects except that it's usually a bit slower and it crashes occasionally.

About 10 months after I purchased the camera (and had the original replaced, remember) the LCD screen became very blurry so that I could not even see the picture that I'd just taken.

This was my first digital camera and I was really disappointed in what I saw in the pictures.  They were grainy and lacked detail.  I suppose if I looked more closely at the camera, I would have noticed the 1/8 inch diameter lens and that might have clued me in that there would be a difference.  I was just looking for something to take pictures to send in e-mails and this did not do the job.  The pictures taken inside were dark.  I expect that if I only used this camera outside on sunny days it might work better.  I also found it very hard to hold.  Because all the controls are on the side that you hold the camera, the camera seemed unbalanced and was easily dropped.  The wrist strap is a must.  ... is the most that I have ever paid for a camera, and I guess I expected more.  I can see from the general pricing of the digital cameras that this is on the low end.  Since I was not after something that would be used for printing pictures, I had assumed, from all the favorable reviews, that this camera would work.  I was mistaken.  I am not sure I place much trust in  reviews, without some actual photos to back them up.  The software to import the pictures into the computer worked very well and was fast through the USB port.

I was not able to see what I was trying to take a photo of unless I used the view finder and as a result, many of my photos show the bride and groom very far off in the actual photo.The camera takes wonderful photos outdoors and in limited flash photo situations so it is a great camera for those types of photos.  As for indoor, low light photos, it may turn out to be a nightmare.Happy photo shooting.","Date":"August 23, 2002"}
{"Title":"Quite Disapointed","Author":"\"wigmo\"","ReviewID":"R2U775I99VZ4V9","Overall":"bad","Content":"My previous camera was the HP C200, which from an image quality standpoint was fantastic.  My mistake was carrying this opinion over to the 315 model.  There are improvements, such as a far superior LCD screen, and better battery consumption.  However, the image quality is unacceptable.  The images have a clear grain to them, even under professional lighting.  This is evident both on screen and printed on photo quality paper.  The firmware update did nothing to correct this issue either.  I would strongly suggest purchasing another model, or another brand all together.","Date":"April 5, 2001"}
{"Title":"Easy, but quality suffers","Author":"Pix_Z","ReviewID":"R3C8NO7UKFHCVM","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this camera at a store liquidation. I thought that Hewlett Packard would probably deliver a decent level of quality, but not necessarily the best. As I was planning on using it mainly to sell stuff on online auctions, I didn't need a camera with lots of features or spectacular quality.The controls on this camera are very easy. I suppose if one wanted to they could get away with just pressing various buttons until they got to the menu item they wanted. You can simply link the camera up to a USB port and not bother with installing software.The quality of picture, however, was rather fuzzy. I sell collectibles online, and the camera did not capture enough detail to show if the item I was selling was damaged or not. I stood from a few feet to 12 feet away, no difference. I finally gave up and sold it to someone else who didn't mind the quality issues. I think this camera does particularly poor at short distances. My work had a different brand camera, same megapixels. It did a much better job, and I currently awaiting my new Olympus.If quality is a rather low concern and the price you're getting is very low, this camera might be worth it. If there's not that much price difference between this camera and another with better quality (say a Nikon Coolpix 2500), I'd opt for the other camera.","Date":"August 4, 2002"}

{"Title":"TRY Before Buying","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RE7Q6CAT48O49","Overall":"bad","Content":"After researching Consumer Reports and everything else I could find, I picked the C-2040.  Before purchasing one for yourself - get your hands on one and experiment.My job demands documentation of models etc, so I decided to replace my 20-year-old SLR and go digital.  Features such as zoom, manual focus and accuracy of the viewfinder (for composition) were important to me.  To start off, the 2040's zoom feature is operated by a small lever that zooms very quickly without the precision of a traditional macro lens.  The manual focus feature was the most disappointing - you must guess the approximate distance between the camera and the object you wish to photograph from a complex menu.  I had an economy Kodak camera in the 1960's that utilized that same guessing concept.  The viewfinder was too small to be usefull, especially for close up shots.  The LCD screen is also very small, and the picture/color is below par.  Plus, the manual advises against using the LCD screen much because it consumes battery power.  Overall, the controls and the images are too small (I am 20 yrs old with perfect vision).To transfer your pictures from the camera to a computer, an AC adapter is required, but be aware that it is NOT included with the camera.I returned the camera to the store and am sticking to my old film camera for now.","Date":"December 31, 2001"}

It needs used Compact Flash memory cards. Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE. It can hold 4-5 raw images.

Negatives, I feel, not mentioned:  1.  Camera does not have a \"hand strap\".  I used the one from my Kodak 260.  2.  Lens cap, altho coming now with a \"stap\" to attach to lens, still must be released manually - would prefer it to release once camera is turned on or at least fall off being held be strap once lens pops open.  3.  Windows ME \"sees\" the Kodak DC 260 if it is attached via the USB cable and immediately brings up thumbnail images for review and download to selected folders with, in my case, Photoshop acting as the default editor.  You have to select the \"disk\" under My Computer, then do 2 clicks of mouse to get to the camera images.  Or, as one reviewer stated, you can use an inexpensive Smart Reader, pop the disk out of the camera and insert into the reader for fairly fast downloads.  Here again, extra steps that I feel should not be necessary with the 3040.  4.  A cover would be nice for the view monitor.  Taking the camera out of a pouch can, if not careful, cause finger prints to appear on the view finder as you grip the extruding retracted lens with its cover and a reach over digital where the thumb or fingers finds the view monitor.But resolution?

Except for the 20 or so that got wiped out by a CF card error when the batteries went down. I would highly recommend to anyone buying this camera - get yourself a USB CF card reader and dump the images frequently to your PC. And try to avoid reviewing shots you have taken in the camera. Dump the files to your PC and then you can look at them all you like. I would also avoid deleting shots while shooting, as this will put you at a high risk of card error due to losing battery power while reading the CF card. Get a large capacity CF cards and edit the shots when you get home. Another annoying thing about the camera is that when the batteries expire (as they do constantly), the zoom lens is frozen in position. Without battery power, the lens doesn't retract into the camera. The integral lens cap also remains open. This has to have been an engineering oversight. Why couldn't the camera just close the lens and THEN shut down? Duh.Summary:Good camera, Frustrating power and CF card error issues.Don't believe the hype.

The camera is designed to eat batteries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  We had to buy a rechargeable alkaline system in order to avoid going to the poor-house.The smart engineers who designed this camera noticed that it eats batteries too quickly.  Their solution was to turn off the camera if you let your finger slip from the \"shoot\" button for only a moment.

My experience has been that the camera is great taking pics outdoors on a nice sunny day, but under any other lighting conditions this camera is a bigtime .....  The autofocus indoors is completely unreliable and does not consistently produce properly focused pics regardless of whether you are using it in Auto mode or P mode.  So the \"point and shoot\" aspect of this camera is like flipping a coin -- heads, your pic turns out fine; tails, sorry you missed the shot.  OK, so why not try manual focus?  Well, the viewfinder on this camera is an EVF which produces an image somewhat akin to putting your eye an inch or so from a TV set -- what you mostly see is lots of dots and it is basically IMPOSSIBLE to see a crisp image as you adjust the manual focus to try and sharpen the focus.  Using the LCD instead of the EVF to focus the shot is also problematic -- it's just about impossible to see the LCD outdoors in bright sunlight, and even the image on the LCD is not good enough when trying to manually focus using high zoom.  I'm amazed and quite skeptical about some of the glowing reviews others have written.

Plan to take pictures of stationary objects, or people posing.  No matter the shutter speed, the time between your press of the shutter button and the actual image capture is an eternity.  You will have to \"lead\" your subjects while holding the shutter button and waiting for the snap.The internal viewfinder is a small LCD, which is slow and jumpy.  The benefit is that you are looking thru the lens.  Otherwise it is terrible.Taking pictures in low light is a [gamble].  You cannot see a thing in either the internal or external LCD viewfinders.  You will have to guess what is in the frame, and snap a flash picture to find out what you've got.The quality of indoor pictures in average lighting is questionable.  This camera will not simply make black look black.  Dark areas always have red \"hot pixels\", which makes the picture look very grainy, even with the flash.Bottom line, I do not recommend this camera for a film replacement.

In photo mode, it's cool (i guess whatever new model of DC which will take pretty good photos now). Other than taking Photos, it will take short movie clips too...However, when i look at the spec before i buy it. It says \"15 sec Quick Time Movie using 8MB card\". Then i thought that's because of the small size memory. The true is the camera really can only take 15 seconds of each movie clip... if u have a 16mb card, u may take 2-3 movies... Imagine how many things you can do in 15sec... Compare to other camera, such as fuji, they shoot 80sec of avi movie, and the quality is a lot better when you are not shooting movie under the sun.You may say, if shooting movie, go get a Mini DV.. but 15sec/clip is really not enough.. also you will get lots of noise pixel when u are shooting indoor movie. No sound when previewing a movie on the camera. When recording movie, it will capture the disk writing sound and is very noisy. It's in Quick time movie, and i found that not every computer has quicktime player, so i need to download the player everytime i am showing the movie in a new place.Beside the movie, it takes me a 2 days and i still can't find out how to do autonumber on the image file. Finally the Tech Support answer me in few days (that i've already made a refund) telling me that it can be change in the software browser.The 10X zoom is great.

The CF card recorded photos/movies as being taken but there was no view or quick review on the LCD (just blank) and the actual image of each photo, when viewed on the CF card, was a black blank one.  Oddly, the audio portion of mini-movies did record but no images.(2) Canon customer support was non-existant.  They walked me through a few exercises with the camera on the phone and then pronounced it as having a hardware problem.  They told me I would have to return it to them for service and that I would have to package, insure and return it at my own expense and inconvenience.  I did eventually (after talking to several levels of 'customer service' support people) get them to agree to send a pre-paid mailing label for the camera's return but this was not willingly offered and they made the point that they \"never\" do this.All I can say is thank heavens for Amazon.com and their exemplary customer support and willingness to stand by whatever product they sell.  Amazon.com sent me a return mail label and they are sending me a replacement camera.Yes, I am going to give the Canon PowerShot S110 a second chance because, quite honestly, there is no other camera out there at that price that meets all my needs so completely.  I certainly hope this one functions properly and I will report back with a follow-up review as to how satisfied I am with my 2nd experience with the Canon S110.","Date":"March 4, 2002"}

On purchase, the buyer learns that the camera's driver only works if the S110 is connected directly to the computer: no hubs, no other USB devices. In fact, the USB driver for the S110 cannot even be installed if a hub is in place. This violates the whole reason USB ports/protocols were developed: to permit daisy-chaining of peripherals. There is not the slightest chance the S110 is going to be my only USB connected peripheral.I am so disgusted with Canon, Inc. over this issue that I will never again trust anything Canon publishes or manufactures.So, if you never intend to use any other USB device -- go ahead.

I had batteries from another Kodak camera (DC265)and those would only last 2-3 pictures and then go out.

The camera could literally take 2-3 shots immediately after charging all night. Of course, when I wanted them to fix the problem, I had to send in the camera for 6-8 weeks rather than Kodak just sending me a battery that works.In addition, Kodak recently turned off - or quit advertising - their tech support #. They're trying to make everyone use their online knowledge base. I understand that but with the problems highlighted in the reviews of this product, I would think they'd offer a higher level of support.In agreement with other comments, the battery life is awful. I carry 2 sets of backup AA batteries when I take the camera away from home.The camera itself takes pretty good pictures in the right environment. That is, as far as the flash can reach. In low light, it can't focus and you can't do so manually - result is terrible pictures.On the plus side, the software that comes with the camera is simple but effective.","Date":"December 26, 2002"}
{"Title":"Kodak DX3600","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R31X2BIYOVAADH","Overall":"bad","Content":"This is a nice camera with very good features for the price, however there seems to be a very long delay in the picture taking process.  If the subject is moving at any speed at all, it usually is out of the view finder by the time the picture is recorded, unless you try and follow it like a video cam.  Another problem has been the on/off switch.  At least 50% of the time the camera will not turn on, and on some occasions turns off before the timer feature is activated and will not turn on again.  This appears to be a fault with this unit and not a funtion of the camera in general.  I have read others have had the same problem, which leads to a suspect quality control issue with Kodak.  I will return this camera and try another unit, because I do like the features, however the long term sevice contract may be something to consider for the Kodaks at the time of purchase.","Date":"April 25, 2002"}

{"Title":"Lots of problems!!!","Author":"Ron C.","ReviewID":"R61EJ6UY7QKVZ","Overall":"bad","Content":"When we first got the camera, we were impressed.  It was easy to use, and the pictures that we took printed out very nicely.However, after having the camera for a few months, we started to see the following problems.1. POOR BATTERY LIFE After only a couple of weeks of use, the rechargeable battery that came with the camera would only take 5-6 shots before dying.  We kept the camera contantly on the dock, so it should not have run out.  I assumed it was a defective battery and bought some desposable batteries for it, but had a similar problem.  With a brand new battery, it would take 20-30 shots and it would fail to work.2. RANDOM POWERING OFFThis was really annoying.  After several months of use, the camera started turning itself off frequently.  Sometimes I have to restart it 4-5 times to get it to stay turned on.  Even then, it will often turn itself off when trying to take the picture.  I have 3 small kids, and I have missed so many shots because of this.3. LONG PAUSE BEFORE SNAPPING PICTUREI know this is not a defect, but is probably by design (probably the auto-focus working), but there is a half second pause between the time you push the button and the picture actually takes.  We have missed many shots because of that as well.I hate to say it, but I will not buy a Kodak camera again.  It's too bad, because when this did work properly, the pictures were really good and the dock is really a good idea.  We eventually decided to buy a new, higher end camera (Fuji Finepix  S7000).  We will see how that turns out :)","Date":"July 13, 2004"}

{"Title":"Battery Life is Very Poor","Author":"MCB","ReviewID":"R2KHNQCEIL9URT","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Kodak DX3600 would be a very nice camera except that battery life is very poor. I'm lucky to get 8 pictures before the batteries go dead (I use rechargeable batteries with the Easy Share dock, and AA Alkalines).[...] Kodak is aware of the problem. Here is their response to my query about poor battery life...'Because batteries are chemical products involving internal chemical reactions, their performance may deteriorate with prolonged storage.NiMH rechargeable batteries, if not used for a while, may need to be reconditioned as you would when using them for the first time.Otherwise, deactivation of the internal reactants may cause decreased capacity, which causes premature termination of charging.  In other words, the batteries will not charge completely, even though the dock indicates they have.If this happens, we have a couple of recommendations.  First, make sure you have the latest firmware. If you don't, consider updating your camera to the latest version.  You can locate the update by going to:[...]Once there, choose your camera from the list.  The next page will offer all the available software for your model, including any current firmware updates,  if available.  The firmware download will have a \"Read-me\" file that contains the directions for performing the update.Once you have successfully completed the update, we recommendconditioning your battery the way you would if it were being used for the first time, as we mentioned above.  It is important that you be sure you always have a fully charged battery.  To do so, place the camera on the KODAK EASYSHARE Camera Dock.  When the charge light turns green (all three green lights are lit for a Dock II), then remove the camera from the dock FOR A MINIMUM OF 5 MINUTES, and place it back on the dock.  The 5 minutes the camera is off the dock are the key to correct rechargingfor a new or uncharged battery.  Repeat this same process until the combined charging time, while the light is red on the dock, EQUALS A MINIMUM OF 2 HOURS.Once you have completed this charging process, we recommend that you leave the camera on its dock and intermittently check it for power (remove from the dock for a while then replace it).  If you use yourcamera frequently, of course, you will always have a charged battery because you will be removing and replacing it.  If you do not use your camera frequently, periodically remove the camera from the dock and take a few test shots. Doing this assures a properly maintained battery sothat you will have lots of power.Do not make the mistake of trying to charge the KODAK PHOTOLIFE Lithium Battery, CRV3, that comes with the camera.  It is not rechargeable, and an attempt to do so could result in leakage.  Also, please be aware that the camera will only charge the KODAK KAA2HR NiMh Battery.  Non-Kodakbatteries or individual AA rechargeable batteries (including Kodak batteries) are not compatible with this charger.  If you need a separate charger, they are available at the Kodak online store.Remember, your camera's dock is only charging when it displays the red light.  If the light is green, that means it is either done charging or has detected another type of battery it cannot charge.PLEASE NOTE!  Your camera's batteries lose power during image reviews and when adjusting camera settings.  Use of the LCD screen is also a big drain.......................'  If I had known about the battery problem I never would have bought this camera. Did you read the section above when Kodak states \"the batteries will not charge completely, even though the dock indicates they have.\" We can send robots to Mars but we can't make a battery charger that knows when a battery is really charged? What the hell good is a battery charger that doesn't know if a battery is charged or not? So just because the little green light says charged you can't believe it. I tried the firmware upgrade and that was futile, no help at all, just a waste of time.As is, I now carry at least 8 AA Alkalines (they last about 10 pictures if you keep the LCD turned off) whenever I use this camera away from home because you never know when it will just shut down by itself from weak batteries.  In defense to the camera I will say that it takes good pictures in daylight (night pictures with flash are worthless), I like the fact you can add other lenses and the built in video recorder is ok. The included software is nice. It includes options to adjust tint, brightness, crop etc.... The photo album is easy to use and makes saving the pictures easy. Also the removable compactflash card is a nice feature.  So if you decide to get this camera be prepared to buy lots of AA batteries. Personally I will never buy another Kodak product. I don't think it's right to sell a product with an apparent design flaw and then offer the consumer a, in my opinion, worthless remedy. These cameras should have been recalled and the consumer offered a full refund or a camera that works the way it should!","Date":"January 21, 2005"}

Until you consider that unlike most cameras on the market, all the bits and pieces you need to have to use it are propritary SONY only parts which are not up to industry standards and are quite over priced as well. The memory stick, has the lowest capacity of any memory device on the market. Even the batteries are propritary. If you're on a little trip and want to take a photo but your battery has run out, on most cameras you can drop into a store (any store) and buy off the shelf parts that will last for at least a few pictures. Not so with sony. You must buy their stuff. And their stuff stinks compared to what the rest of the camaras out there can have. If you got a compact flash camera, you can get \"digital film\" that costs much less per picture and holds up to 12 times as many photos.

{"Title":"Red hue in photos","Author":"\"nicktuba\"","ReviewID":"R2LKDDTEP4SESC","Overall":"bad","Content":"After owning and using the Sony DSC-P50 digital camera and being very satisfied with the results, I bought a DSC-S85 camera believing it would continue the same level of quality. Unfortunately, my expectations were misplaced with the S85. Maybe I wasn't using it correctly, but the photos I took with it had a reddish/pink hue. This hue was present whether I was shooting in outdoor (bright sunlight) or indoor (artificial light) situations. I tried to fix this by correcting the white balance and raising the flash level, but this only made the problem worse. When this problem continued to occur, I returned my first DSC-S85 to the store and got a replacement. The replacement camera did the same thing! In addition to the red hue, the shutter speed on the DSC-S85 was very slow; it was impossible to take photos in rapid succession. Also, the shutter would not open when the button was pressed (a one to two-second lag). All in all, I was disappointed by the performance of this camera and would not purchase another Sony digital camera product again (unless they substantially improve upon these issues).

There is so much data available; you can just keep zooming in and in... Two stars for the picture!Having said this, I returned this camera after 10 days. - The first set of lithium batteries quit after less than 5 minutes. I turned the camera on and off maybe 6-8 times to check features and took one picture (!!!) before the camera shut down.- The second set lasted for 8 pictures. These were the (useless) alkaline batteries included by Minolta. Why did they bother?- I then purchased two sets of 1800ma NiMH AA batteries. I used these for a little over a week during vacation. And never got over 20 pictures out of these batteries. (I carried the dead camera for most of that vacation.)This monstrous battery usage made the camera almost unusable. A few other things to watch out for...- The auto focus is a little quirky and slow.- I put the camera on a camera strap and hung it around my neck. The rubber protector of the viewfinder rubbed against my body and fell off on the first day. Also, the odd shape of the camera back was very uncomfortable hung around my neck this way.- A 16MB card for a 5.2 Megapixel camera? I am surprised the camera itself doesn't laugh when installed. At the highest setting you can only get one picture out of this card! Even at the \"Normal\" compression setting you will get maybe 12 pictures.- Very sparse software.- No AC adapter.I would recommend passing on this camera unless you have a very long extension cord.

Overall I was sorely disappointed with the Dimage 7.  Despite half the resolution, the Sonys pics appeared nicer both on the monitor and when printed even in 8x10 format using the highest resolution of both cameras.  The electronic viewfinder is disconcerting, focusing using the autofocus was inaccurate, and the flash is inconsistent, sometimes overexposing, sometimes underexposing.  Color balance is off.  Autofocus in dim light is difficult.  Also, this camera goes through batteries unbelievably quickly.  Don't even think about using alkaline batteries.  NiMH are a must and should come with the camera.  Instead, you get 4 cheapo alkalines that last about 5 minutes (no exaggeration).  Top quality alkalines don't last much longer.  Also omitted is an AC adapter - apparently optional but, really guys, this should come with the camera!  Also comes with only 16MB compact flash card, not enough to store even one uncompressed 2560x1920 image.  I've heard so many great things about the lens, but the Zeiss 10x lens on my Sony is vastly superior. Finally, the camera has a plastic body and just feels cheap.

That's why I gave it 2 stars.  The box says \"One touch upload\" all over it.  Apparently, that's only if you're not running Windows.  I can't load the software because it's incompatible with 1.) Windows Media Player 7, 2.) Easy CD Creator 4.x and 3.) the driver for my CDRW... I have all of them.  I spent at least 45 minutes last night waiting for tech. support, then they walked me through the installation of the software, got a fatal error message again and told me to download the ASPI32 fix from Adaptec.com, then call back.  Got there only to find a disclaimer saying don't download if running WMP 7 or Easy CDC 4.x, I'm running both.  When I called back this am tech support told me to \"sit tight\" and keep checking the websight for a fix.  When I asked for a supervisor she came on with attitude, and said the same thing.  Then I told her that I bought the camers in Florida and wanted to return it, she said Nikon doesn't take returns.  I had always trusted Nikon as a company to produce and stand behind their top quality products, apparently they have adopted a new set of business practices and ethics.  Are they hiring customer service people from WI Electric?  The box says \"shoot, send, share & save\".  So far I can only shoot.  It says Nikon even includes; a battery, charger, software and an 8mb flash card so you can use it \"right away\".  Nikon's technical support team has no idea when the fix will become available.  The way I see it is I spent over (dollar amount)(after tax and an extra card and case) and am only able to shoot, until who knows when.  I am surprised and disappointed that they didn't just offer to ship me a card reader to use until the software fix is available.

I have used other Nikon models with very good success.  This camera gave very washed out pictures and skin tones when used indoors.  The flash is not what it should be.  The skin tones looked green, almost dead.  I did like the nikon4 software program because it allowed a person to save pictures to a file, renamed the pictures to what ever the user wanted and evens allows the pictures, as a group, to be saved as a given size. This was nice because it made renaming and saving photos a snap because they were saved as a batch.  I returned the camera and purchased a Canon Power shot S110 Elph.  The difference is striking. For around the same money, I think the Canon wins easily.  Vivid colors and a GREAT flash that leaves colors vivid and true.","Date":"November 21, 2001"}

And as the issue is widespread, Nikon's customer service team has let the consumer down as well, by failing to identify the potential issues on the box.....

I could turn the camera off and back on and it would work.  That went on till last night where the camera just quit working and the \"system error\" message is on all the time.  It has something to do with the plastic binding around the lens.  I'm really upset after reading the reviews on this camera because this problem seems to be fairly common.  Most of the reviews with the same problem have stated that Nikon is not helpful in honoring the warranty or fixing the camera for a reasonable price.  I will give it a try and send the camera to them. If they won't fix for a reasonable price I will never by another Nikon.  I just don't think a camera should be this easy to break.

I can't tell you how many times I've had the perfect shot lined up, only to go and take the picture and have the camera delay for several painfully long seconds while it does whatever it does (focus?) before the flash goes off. Needless to say, this isn't acceptable when trying to take candid photos of your child or people in general. If it is the auto focus, then it has to be the slowest in its category. I watch with envy as friends use their digital cameras without impugnity, popping off one shot after another without having to wait for their cameras to ready up. There are other problems as well. Like when you're lining up your shot and--whoops!--the picture screen blackens. You have to press the picture button to bring it back up. Again, you missed the shot. The Nikon Coolpix 775 makes me pine for my old film-loaded cameras and illustrates the importance of doing your research before buying anything of value. I wish I had.","Date":"April 13, 2003"}

The best thing that ever happened to it was I dropped it on the floor and killed it. Then I bought a Canon. What a difference! The problem with the Nikon was it does not focus in low light and instead of being smart, like focusing at 6-8ft like you were going to take a picture of someone in a room, it focuses at infinity or wherever it happens to be when it is trying to focus.Don't buy this camera!","Date":"June 4, 2003"}

But I wanted to see it in real life, just to ensure all the reviews where genuine. And so I did. And in one word, I would have to say I was Disappointed. First off, it takes about 1-2 seconds for the shutter to respond from when you take the photo. That might not sound like much, but from the 10 shots I took of people walking in the store, everyone of those shots resulted in the person completely out of the scene by the time the shot went off. So I guess if all you want to do is take still photography, this might not be a big deal. Second, the flash didn't work for more than 5 feet. I took photos inside the store, and anything beyond about 5 feet, turned out to be pretty dark. I compared these photos to a Canon s110, and the canon took far better photos inside the store.So that's my review. I was extremely disappointed.

It was easy to use, had a nice size and fit our budget. However, we took photos of a family event over the weekend, and comparing those photos with some photos from a friend's Canon Elph S-110, we noticed significant picture quality differences. Our photos from our family event (which was indoors) looked grainy and overly \"noisy.\" Lots of added pixels, banding, etc. The indoor shots from the Canon were clearer, and more solid. Also, the Canon had a much brighter flash which captured more detail. The Nikon, even on the indoor party setting, was not nearly as sharp. I was surprised and disapointed at these results. The Canon flesh tones seemed to run more yellow, the Nikon flesh tones seemed to run more true; but I can balance that all out in Photoshop. The Nikon banding and extra noise, though, really affected picture quality for us. Also, the movie mode in the Canon includes sound, whereas the Coolpix does not.

Smart Media is much smaller in capacity (128mb vs over 1000mb). This is a very important consideration when looking at any camera which produces such large image files. Smart Media isn't very smart. Since unlike Compact Flash it has no onboard controller. (meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait. And including a measly 16mb memory stick is a JOKE on a 4 megapixel camera. It can hold 2-3 raw images.

I was both very surprised and dismayed to find the overall performance of the Kodak 3MP hardly any better and in some respects worse.While I admit this camera is very easy to use and that it delivers reasonably acceptable quality pictures in brightly lit outdoor conditions (perhaps the reason for all the rave reviews), indoors I find the performance very poor.  The autofocus is unreliable in even medium indoor lighting (forget about low light), resulting in an a fair porportion of the shots turning out out-of-focus.  Also, there is a lot of digital noise and none of the dozens of indoor shots I've tried could be described as truly sharp, crisp and full of detail.In addition to this, the capture time is annoyingly long and seems to increase somewhat as more shots are taken, especially when using the flash.  I recorded times as long as 14 seconds - too long if you ask me.The shutter speed in AUTO mode was on average 1/20 seconds or so indoors.  Even using the flash, this is too long to get jitter free pics. Nor was there any noticable difference if I increased the ISO.  All that did was increase the noise.Build quality is only fair and I'm not very impressed with the image editing software included. I'll be returning it.Overall, if you're not too picky and only intend on shooting web shots or something, this camera will do the job.  But then, so will a much cheaper camera. If you're looking for a 3MP camera that will take anything even near 35mm quality photos, look elsewhere.I'm very disappointed, Kodak","Date":"September 2, 2002"}
{"Title":"Piece of cheap plastic junk ! (MP's isn't everything.)","Author":"superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"","ReviewID":"R3I70R7CV22P11","Overall":"bad","Content":"Here's the reasons why I call this a cheap plastic junk,1. The 3 MP doesn't give enough picture quality. 3MP is just a marketing thing, its actual quality is more like 2MP.2. Visible purple fringing/ chromatic aberrations.3. LCD monitor is not good, tough to see anything on in sunlight. Using a cheapish LCD helps drive profit margins higher for Kodak on this.4. Unacceptable time lag when veiewing on LCD.5. Takes more than 14 secs to write anything on the CF card. Even my last year's camera was much better than this !6. Poor viewing capabilites.7. You need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock. Why doesn't Kodak sell it along with camera itself ? After all it hardly worth 15 bucks !8. Missing features like movie/audio, Video out, atleast some manual controls etc.I have compared this camera to other Canon/Sony ones and find this way below on quality/features compared to them. I see that many people here have a 5 star review for this, but then maybe its their first experience with a digicam. Kodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras. Buy a Canon S200 or S330 or A40 and you will be much more happy. They have much more features and have very good metallic bodies. Don't buy this plastic junk. Look all the freebies that Kodak is throwing in to sell this :)I know I will not be very pouplar in my harsh review about this cheapie but I prefer to be candid.","Date":"May 17, 2002"}

Yes, the memory card is too small, but otherwise it seemed to have all of the features I was looking for.  The first few photos looked pretty good as well.  However, with continued use, the camera simply doesn't perform.  After taking only about 30 photos, the camera now refuses to take any more photos, and those last few photos were out of focus and either over or under exposed.  Changing batteries helps for a short while, but even using CRV3 lithium batteries rather than AA's, after a very short while the camera refusues to perform other than to let you see the few photos you've already taken.  I'm not aware of other cameras that consume battery power like this, so my plan is to get rid of this camera and buy a new one soon.","Date":"March 23, 2003"}

The top selling points were the megapixels, price, and the convenience of the docking station. Unfortunately, non of these things matter if the pictures the camera takes stink!The pictures are grainy, have no detail and are not sharp. In fact, it is diffucult to get a subject in focus, but this fact does not matter since even the in-focus pictures have no detail. A red flower surrounded by green foliage shows up as a red blob. NOT what I was expecting. I suspect an inferior lens. I have an Olympus C-3030 which takes excellent sharp, clear, very detailed, beautiful photos.Amazon's price for the DX3900 was the best I found on the net. Amazon's no hassle return policy is fantastic, we got a return authorization and printed up a shipping label already and will be sending this pathetic camera + docking station next business day.We replaced the DX3900 with a Nikon Coolpix 885, a great camera with a great Nikon lens!","Date":"July 7, 2002"}

{"Title":"I hate the DX3900!","Author":"Renee","ReviewID":"RZIFBHOTF1FB","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have owned the Kodak DC240 which is just over 2 years now and decided to upgrade to the DX3900 for larger enlargement capabilities. I loved my DC240. It was a great camera. I am, however, COMPLETELY disappointed in this new camera. While the photo quality is supposedly better, on my computer screen, I do NOT see it. Enlargements are yet to be seen. I also HATE with capital letters the DIGITAL ZOOM feature so much, if I hadn't spent the money I just did on this thing -- I WOULD TOSS IT IN THE TRASH! The only way you can use the digital zoom is by using the LCD monitor! It's insane! You have to zoom, stop, push select, pull the camera away, look into the LCD, zoom again and then take a photo. I am going to miss so many wonderful opportunities by having to take all these steps! They also eliminated the high/low light adjustment of this camera's LCD. The camera is also too small for me. I am 5'5\" and have small hands and I find the size awkward. I also have a very difficult time seeing out of the view finder. It's just badly designed. And so far, I have had the camera for 8 hours, and it has locked up and froze twice. My first Kodak DC 240 did that and I had to have it replaced. It looks like this one has a similar problem. And the on/off switch is in a very inconvenient place!The Kodak software also stinks.  It shows you this little snap shot maybe  2 x 3 inches in 1200 x 800 rez.  You can't zoom in or resize the photo in viewing mode like you could with their old software.  All you can do is setup a slide show which is preset with horrible defaults.  If you don't like the defaults, you have to manually change them every time you run a slide show.  I am so mad I bought this heap of trash, you don't know! Frankly, on a A to F scale, I would rate this camera a solid F for FLUNK! It stinks. I wish my Kodak DC240 would take higher resolution photos because this new thing is going backwards with technology. Kodak, your developers lost it! Sorry. Don't buy this -- trust me you'll regret it! You can have mine if you want to pay for it...I'll gladly sell it!I am not a professional, but I am an educated, consumer wise individual who holds a masters degree.

I have a 3 yr old 1 meg Kodak camera that takes much better photos than this 3 meg.  The photos are not crisp by any means.  I expected a little more by stepping up 2 megs. Once I got over the fact that the 3900 didn't come with a rechargeable battery, I was irate by the fact that it doesn't come with streaming video like the much less expensive 3600.  The 3900 is much more expensive than the 3600, yet the 3600 has more features.  I compared both and the 3600 even takes better pictures with only 2 megs.  Don't make my mistake.

{"Title":"reasonably priced beginner camera but serious drawbacks","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2WIE9PYU08U42","Overall":"bad","Content":"i purchased this camera about 9 months ago based on the high user rating listed on cnet, but after using it steadily in the last 9 months, have concluded that i am a little disappointed.  yes, the camera is easy to use and a good value in terms of the megapixels to price ratio (based on my research from 9 months ago) and the supporting software is pretty handy.  however, the biggest downside is probably that the flash is terribe.  anytime you need it (which is often), the flash washes out the image and lends the picture a sterile quality.  (as if the subject is bathed in flourescent lighting even when there is natural light in the room)  be warned, however, that i have heard this is a problem with many digital flashes.  the resulting color problem can be corrected by turning off the flash or using the supressed flash, however, you must be very good at holding the camera ABSOLUTELY still or you'll get a blurry picture (quite often for me).  another major problem i have found is that when used at certain angles or distances, the lense tends to add a slight curvature to otherwise straight objects, sometimes lending a slight \"fish-eye\" effect.  another annoying feature is that there is no battery meter so that you are only aware you have little battery power left right before you run out.  also, be forewarned when you're budgeting that after purchasing this camera, i ended up having to purchase another smart media card with more memory, a nicer printer and photopaper, and a cd burner to store all of my images somewhere other than my hard drive.  of coures, with newer computers, these things may not be as much of an issue.  all in all, i would have to say that given the chance to go back, i would have spent more money and bought a nicer camera (with a better lense!) since i really do love using a digital now.","Date":"August 12, 2002"}

Without this in place, the battery door cracked (from the inside out) under the pressure of the batteries.  After sending the camera to Fuji for repairs, they sent me a bill for [$]!  They said it was an impact crack which is not covered under their marginal warranty. I asked the gentleman at the call center if they would have repaired it free of charge, if I had sent it to them when just the metal component had cracked off.  He said probably.  Since that component breaking off in the first place was to blame for the cracking I am baffled as to why I had to pay a quarter of the original cost of the camera to have it repaired.

Part of the reason why I chose the 2600 is for the rebate Fuji offered with it.  I tried to buy the camera online several times from several different vendors since before Christmas.  Each and every one of them were out of stock for this item.  I even called and emailed Fuji about the 2600s lack of availability.  Here I am ready to spend about $400 on this camera and accessories and no one will even call me back or reply mail me about it.  The rebate was good until 1-31-02.  A few days after the rebate expired, I am notified that this item is now in stock and for sale.  I may be splitting hairs here or just plain frugal, but I cannot help but notice the timing.  I was ready to buy this item ASAP for over a month but now will not do so because of what I percieve to be shady business practices.  Perhaps if a rep. from Fuji lets me know that they will extend the rebate time due to this item's inavailability I will consider purchasing this product.  As it stands, there is way to much good competition out there in the digital camera market for consumers to put up with this sort of thing.

I read another posting about Canon's poor customer service but thought it was just a fluke.  I assure you that is not the case.  Even the best companies have defective products, but I was expecting more from Canon in terms of correcting the problem.  Buyer beware!  PS, I hear Nikon and Minolta are very responsive and customer focused.  I plan to return my camera and purchase anything but a Canon.","Date":"July 4, 2002"}
{"Title":"It's a tricky camera, you will get upset sometimes","Author":"Jeff","ReviewID":"R2Y56KWJC7SER5","Overall":"bad","Content":"Canon G2 makes a good camera for its picture qualityfor more advanced user but not for ordinary userwhen taking a picture.  First, Canon G2 ( I think all series camera coming from Canon) is not truly plug & play camera. It requires its own driver & utility software to display and manage pictures. It took me a whole night to get software installed & connect to G2 with a lot of frustration.  It's unique driver and utility program make your camera can only be downloaded or uploaded to your computer not other' computers if you don't carry Canon's utility CD-ROM with you which means you can only share pictures with friend on small LCD screen when traveling around not on their computer unless a computer is equipped with Memory card reader.  Not like Sony's  USB is truely plug & play, in minutes your camera is reay to read & write like a  portable drive, it accepts in every computer, and you simply just do the copy or cut and paste like whatever you would do at your window desktop, and it acts like memory card reader.  Of cause you can move or store any file you want.Second, my own frustrate experience.  I was shocked when I saw the picture, some were taken at 2272x1704 scale and some were taken at 1024x768 scale in slow shutter.  It looks perfect on 2272x1704, but it also looks awful on 1024x768 scale pictures in slow shutter.  Everything in 1024x768 scale pictures looks blurry with low resolution, for example like waterfall.  Actually all moving persons in picture is like ghost, you can't even recognize their face with movement on the picture.  Wait! These pictures were taken from my wedding party! Thanks Canon for its advanced technology to make this nightmare happens!!  Hope it would not happen on yours folks who would ever think to buy this camera.  I then did some investigation on these awful pictures with provided information, the picture shows it was set on landscape mode which is on a dial next to the auto mode.Then I realized if you set your camera to to auto mode then press menu the setting is 2272x1704 which is corrected setting, but then if you switch the dial to lanscap mode or protrait mode and press the menu button, it shows other setting for 1027 x768 which is not corrected setting.  Why it would go for different setting??? I have no idea ( it may be set as default).  You should know how it happens to the picture when your friend mistakenly turns the dial to landscape mode, also thanks Canon its advanced technology  kicking me back to Sony brand.","Date":"January 18, 2003"}

Langhorne","ReviewID":"RRDQH3IHS3QXK","Overall":"bad","Content":"I initially bought this camera, but after a few days of using it, while I was happy with the photos it produces, I could not get past all the things about it that i did not like.- The lack of audio on movies.  How much would a microphone have cost Olympus to put in??  Seems sort of a waste to even have the movie feature at all without sound.- The motor, I've read it before, and must agree, it sounds like each time the lens comes whirring out of it's shell, it will be the last time.  God awful sound.  Cannot get away from the feeling that they REALLY cut some corners making this camera- ....- Shape and size.  This camera is too large in odd ways.  It is small and large all at once.  Hard to explain, but that is how it felt.  It will not fit in a jacket pocket, forget about a shirt pocket or pants pocket.  The shape is awkward.  While I was holding it, I kept having the feeling like I would drop it if I did not pay attention to the fact that I was holding it.- Last but not least.  The batteries!  I initially thought, well with AA support, I'll never be without batteries as long as I can find a corner store in my hour of need.  What a mistake.  Within the first 2 days I went through 3 sets of 4 batteries.  I really did not think this through.  In retrospect, to me given the availability of lithium battery technology, it would be like buying a laptop computer that used D alkalin batteries for power.  People would laugh at the idea.  They should too when it comes to alkalin and Digital CamerasI ended up returning this camera and moving up a bit to a better camera and am SO much happier.  I bought a Canon S30 and it fulfilled ALL the things I found lacking in the Olympus 3020.  Given that it came with a rechargable lithium battery and charger, if I had kept the Olympus and bought rechargable AA batteries and charger, I would have only spent around 50 more dollars.My last comment in the hopes that some Olympus employee will actually read this and take some action is this.  I mainly bought this camera because I had an Olympus 35MM film camera and loved it (still do!).  It lacked all the things that I had come to expect with my film camera.  Why they could not have used the same camera shell is beyond me.  They do on their lower end models.  I guess that square, awkward shape is a \"feature??\"","Date":"February 15, 2002"}

The instruction booklet on disk is almost useless to use.  Who carries a computer around when they're trying to figure out their camera?  We finally printed out the tome-->300 pages, but found it marginally useful and poorly organized.2.  The menu buttons on the camera stopped working properly after 5 months (required pushing with a pencil with just the right pressure and angle) --unfortunately we didn't get it sent in for repair within the one year warranty.3.  Now at 16 months into ownership the camera is not useable because the zoom lens stopped working--after one too many times grinding against the lens cap that we forgot to remove before turning on the camera.  This is a result of very poor design--inadvertant pressure can turn the camera on at any time and the lens cap prevents the zoom from expanding--instead it 'grinds' against the lens cap.4.  We've researched repair and find that Olympus will charge between $214-$260 to fix this 16 month old camera.When it works, it's a decent camera.  Nice pictures.  But for the reasons above, I don't recommend this camera to anyone.","Date":"April 16, 2003"}

Second: the camera body feels delicate, almost ready tofall apart, maybe due to poor craftsmanship, maybe justplanned obsolescence!! (3). The setting up routing is too complicated, for collegemechanic department graduates only, definitely not forartistic type of person. (4). Poor manual, almost totally unintelligible! (5). I think this camera has serious flaws, both indesign and in craftsmanship.

We were religious about keeping it in its case when we weren't using it.  We didn't drop it or do any damage to it otherwise.  The day before we discovered the cracked screen it had been in its case, in a backpack; the only explanation we could come up with was that something in the backpack jostled against the camera and cracked the screen.  Super sensitive?  We think so!  I mean hey, if I had dropped it and heard that splitting sound things would make sense!  Now I'm thinking I should handle this thing with gloves and keep it wrapped in bubble wrap.  Covered under warranty?  Ha ha!  No damage to the LCD screen is covered under the warranty!  So now we've got to shell out an additional $155 so we can use our month old camera.  Unfortunately, this is the second time we've had a problem with Cannon cameras- the first was an APS who wouldn't load film correctly.

We purchased this camera because our Cannon Power Shot S40 (which was the same type camera we purchased from the buyer) was dropped by accident.  Our previous camera took excellent pictures, with little elasped time, and required no adjusting when on auto.  The Cannon Power Shot that we purchased, and that I am reviewing, took very unfocused and fuzzy pictures.  Even when on auto mode, it was time comsuming to try to get the picture focused and clear.  I used the camera for a school function, and the pictures were basically terrible.  One of our presenters, who was a meterologist for a local news station, requested copies of the pictures I took.  I sent him the requested pictures with along with an apology for the poor picture quality. I sent examples to the buyer of the pictures I took with the camera to show her the type of pictures the camera was taking.Unfortunately, the buyer stated that she questioned the validity of our reason for returning the camera.  In questioning the validity of the return, I feel that she is also questioning our integrity.  The reason we sent a new battery and extra flash card was because we could no longer use them due to no longer owning that type of camera and felt that instead of throwing them away, we would send it back with the camera. We did not consider that sending back these items would give such a negative impression.I am very frustrated that because we were not satisfied with our purchased and chose to return the item, our legitimate complaint is questioned.

This camera seems great -- affordable, awesome optical zoom, and compact -- but there are more than a few problems with it.First of all, if you're in a room with soft lighting, the LCD is pitch black.  I tried adjusting the LCD brightness, but it didn't help.  You need to be in a VERY well-lit area to even be able to see what you're taking a picture of, otherwise (I kid you not) it's pitch black.  You end up getting pieces of people's heads instead of a full scene shot.The software installation went just fine, except when I connected the camera to my Pentium 4 running Windows 2000Pro, my computer crashed.  It didn't just crash, though -- it locked down so I couldn't end programs to properly shut down my computer.In case battery life is a concern, it's important to note that the FinePix 2800 runs on 4 AA batteries.  Fuji sells rechargable mAh batteries, but they're VERY expensive ($60 for a 4-pack), and I don't even know how much the charger costs.I was also disappointed with the bundle that comes with the camera.  You get a neck strap -- woo hoo! -- but no case.  I had a lot of trouble finding a case that fit the camera, since the zoom lens bulges out.  I frowned when I saw the camera only came with one-time-use AA batteries, and I frowned more when I saw there wasn't an automatic lens cap.

This makes it nearly impossible in very bright conditions (like the Arizona sun) and dark conditions (any indoor activity with low lighting) to see what you are shooting. You can point and re-take as many times as you need, but I missed too many shots this way. This was my third digital camera, and I returned it because although the prints were beautiful and clear, and I loved the zoom, it wasn't worth sacrificing my compositions for. I played with all the controls to try and adjust, but the only solution was either a tripod or bring your own lighting. I exchanged it for a Canon and am very pleased with it.

Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously.I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera.  I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features.What I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus.  You might say, well I can live with the low light, I COULD NOT!  I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light.  And my pictures were fuzzy.  NOT good Fuji!  Did you rush this one out the door or what.After calling Fuji's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it.(Being in denial I thought, maybe I was doing something wrong, because this camera had the zoom I really wanted.) I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal....","Date":"January 16, 2003"}

No problem, I'm thinking - Its under warranty. I took it in for repair and one month later I was told that the camera had had water damage and the motherboard was fried and the warranty was voided and it could not be repaired.First of all, there was no water damage. I had used it outside earlier that day for about three minutes when it had been lightly snowing. A couple of flakes of snow hit this thing and its fried? What a piece of crap! My old digital camera, an Olympus, had had an entire cup of water accidentally spilled on it - to the point where it had water inside the screen for a week, and is STILL working 3 years later.Its OK because I never liked this camera anyway - it was 3 years newer than my Olympus, but was less sensitive to light and took blurry pictures, (even outside in full daylight!) which my Olympus never did. I was always frustrated with it and this gives me the perfect excuse to buy another brand - I'm just very upset that I lost all the money I paid for it 6 months in!","Date":"January 9, 2004"}

From the get go I disliked the way it handled. It works well, as any camera can with lots of light on still objects. But that is no feat because white balance and lag time are inconsequential with something that has all day. This camera sucked for any type of candid shooting. The time between pressing the button and getting a picture was long enough to ensure that any desired facial expression or pose was either completely altered or not even in the frame. Also, in low levels of light, taking a photo was mere guesswork because the screen would be completely black. For a vast majority of the shots the flash had to be enabled because otherwise the photos would be extremely blurry. The problem however, is that flash makes harsh unnatural ugly color composition photos. Basically I hated it. I bought myself an Olympus Stylus 710 recently and love it dearly. That is a camera that can preform in a variety of differnt situations and lights.","Date":"July 30, 2006"}

A great picture captures the essence of the moment. For most amateur photographers the time delay aspect is of lessor importance, however a Coolpix 5000 customer should expect superior performance. The time delay is way too long between pressing the shutter button and recording the picture. Even using a lower resolution setting the delay is unacceptable for this high-end camera. All other features of the camera are up to par with expectations, which I am more than happy about. Overall the quality of the hardware and the picture itself is excellent. However it is this one aspect of speed that irks me the most. For instance, taking a simple portrait is frustrating, as a facial expression I want to capture has changed by the time the camera is ready to shoot. If this one issue were to be fixed I would strongly recommend the Coolpix 5000","Date":"February 19, 2002"}

After one year with the Coolpix 5000, let's just say that I'm no longer a happy Nikon customer.As already stated by many other reviewers, the camera's features are great, but this camera is extremely fragile. I was most attracted by the high resolution as I often like to create large prints of a few vacation pics for wall framing. Unfortunately, I've come home from my last two major vacations with nothing to show. The camera failed before I even got to my destination!I also want to point out that I am not rough with my equipment. I take very good care of expensive purchases like this camera. In this case, I carried the camera in a leather padded bag made specifically for the Coolpix 5000. And the camera case was being transported in a padded carry-on bag. So, no Samsonite gorilla was throwing the camera around and it was well protected at all times.To Nikon's credit they repaired the camera in both instances with no questions asked. But, in each case, little information was given as to the failure mode. Both times, the only information returned was 'repaired image control PCB'. With 15 years in the electronics industry, I know that there must be some serious mechanical stability issues with this camera for damage to be this easily incurred on a solid state electronic board.Now that my camera is out of warranty, I'm afraid to take it out of the house. And I have no pictures to share with family and friends from my last two vacation adventures.","Date":"December 8, 2002"}

{"Title":"auto exposure and auto focus rarely work","Author":"pinkpanther \"info@girlray.com\"","ReviewID":"R3SI2M4MF7ODCD","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera does produce some outstanding results when  the auto-focus and exposure meter work. Unfortunately, this would be an extremely low percentage of the time.  Most of the time it requires an enourmous amount of light and contrast in a photo in order to lock in auto-focus.  Why many competitors such as Sony and especially Olympus have been able to master this challenge and leave Nikon in the dust is anyones guess.The true problem with the exposure meter is that the sensor is directly next to the area where you must release the trigger.  Therefore when you take a photo you are blocking the sensor. I don't think you need an engineering degree to know why this does not work.  When I emailed Nikon's service dept they agreed that this was in fact a problem (without a solution.)My reccomendation would be to purchase an Olympus 4040 or Olympus 5000 which I have used with excellent results. Both also have a 1.8 aperature lens which means you will need almost half as much light as you do with the nikon. The only thing you will  have to sacrafice is the swivel LCD screen.  I think it is a fair trade off for focussed and properly exposed images.","Date":"April 7, 2003"}

Besides the now-standard but always annoying delay built into virtually any piece of digital equipment (I thought digital was going to make things faster, not slower, didn't you?), the Coolpix 5000 will often just decide it's taken enough pictures for now, thank you very much, and it will do nothing more.I've gone over and over the instruction manual and can find no hint as to what to do in this situation. I am focused, I have checked lighting, I have my settings correct, I push the button...and then I push it again...and then I push it again, and then again, and again and again and again, and then I hold it down until my finger hurts, and then I just want to throw the stupid camera in front of an asphalt truck. Nothing happens. If I turn it off and then back on, nothing happens. If I turn it off and leave it alone for 24 hours, then it usually is ready to have fun again.

Wlin","ReviewID":"R1MX193CAVBMIF","Overall":"bad","Content":"I don't think I need to repeat the great reviews on this item but I can tell you that it works very well with my D90. The auto focus is pretty fast even at low light unlike some of the comments I saw. The auto focus Nikon body has a male drive pin that engages to the female pin on the lens ring and the focus locks it plenty fast for most applications. You need to make sure that you engage the auto focus switch next to the lens lock button on front of the D90 body. Switch it off for manual focus otherwise you will not be able to move the focus ring. Being able to use this motor-less lens was one of the main reasons why I purchased the D90 because it just saved me $500-%600 getting this lens. I am sure a $700 lens will be faster but since I don't use this lens much it suits my need quite well. Just took a photos of a duck zoomed in all the way and compared it with my $350 18-105 Nikor zoom, the difference is day and night due to the optical zoom of course. Now, I can take photos of birds. Can't see any reason to spend $700 for a dozen photos a year which is what my usage rate is. The lens has no VR so I braced myself and took a photo of a duck and the result is stunning. I compared the same photo with a friend's with the 18-200 and I must say the result is better on the 70-300mm since it is really a 450mm optical zoom. Not really a fair comparison since it is twice the zoom but now I can clearly see no reason to get the 18-200. My 18-105 with the 70-300 give me the complete range coverage I need. I don't make a living with photography and I can't really tell the difference between photos taken with this lens and a $700 lens unless I put them side by side. If there is a difference, you would have to use a magnifying glass I am sure. The photos are just great already. I would not buy this lens if I have a D40 because it will not work with auto focus. There is a Sigma lens for $50 more if you have the D40, not sure the result you will get with that lens. I have an old Sigma lens which is just horrible but this was purchased 15 years ago, I think a lot has changed since. If you have the D90 or any focus motor body Nikon camera and want to save big money, you will be very pleased that you get this one.Update: after comparing with other lens, this lens is not sharp enough.","Date":"April 14, 2010"}

{"Title":"You get what you pay for","Author":"A. Patterson","ReviewID":"R345P5ZEZXB8U4","Overall":"bad","Content":"Yah, it's cheap. Really, really, butt kickingly, wonderfully cheap. This is cheapest way to get to 300mm. *It won't autofocus on the low end Nikon DSLR's, though.* If the user guide of your low end Nikon DSLR is telling you about lens compatibility issues, you can assume that this one won't work, either.So, is it worth it? If you can't autofocus, no, it's not worth it. The f/5.6 aperture means that when you look through the lens, it's gonna be dark. Even if you're willing to manually focus the thing, the view through the viewfinder is too dark to see clearly, so focusing is going to be hard.Now, what if you have a mid-grade Nikon camera that can autofocus this thing? I'd still say no, for two reasons. First, the lens is soft. Your pictures won't be sharp. If it's the only lens you've ever used except for your kit lens, you'll have to trust me on this. Pretty much every other Nikon lens out there is sharper than this one. Second, the physics of taking picture with a 300mm f/5.6 lens on a DX camera mean that you're only going to get a decent picture in bright bright sunshine. Clouds? Early or late in the day? Indoors? Forget it. You're either going to have to crank the ISO up so that the picture is noisy, or you're going to have to use a shutter speed that's so slow that you get camera shake in every shot.I had this lens once upon a time, and always thought the problem was that I was a bad photographer. Now that I know more, I realize that it was this awful lens. The best thing I ever did was sell it.Recommendations? The 70-300 4-5.6 VR lens is quite good. It's somewhere around $600, but it's worth saving for. Another recommendation if you want cheaper, is the 55-200 VR. It doesn't have as much reach, but at $250, it's actually quite good for the price. Both of these lenses have AF-S, so they will work on the low end Nikon DSLR's, too.","Date":"November 12, 2012"}

{"Title":"Surprisingly underwhelming","Author":"W. Johnson","ReviewID":"R3J9N9Y19Z3HFG","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this as my first digital camera five months ago, largely on the strength of the Amazon reviews.  I intended to use it for routine snapshots. I can't state how well it stacks up against other digital cameras, of which I know nothing.  But I can say I was surprised by deficiencies it has, when compared against my $100 Olympus 35mm film camera.First, the indoor exposure quality is pretty poor.  Its sensitivity reminds me of ASA 100 speed film.  A flash is always required indoors.  The flash is quite anemic: anything 8 feet or more away will be dark.  In photographing a kids' soccer team two rows deep, the front row was slightly overexposed while the rear was underexposed.  The line was about 3 feet deep total.  There is very little exposure latitude with the flash.Second, I have never seen such red eye in my life!  The flash is about 3/4\" from the lens in the same horizontal plane.  I have to spend a couple minutes in Photoshop to clean up every single shot.  I'm used to seeing eyes like this on flash photos of cats, not humans. Third, the battery is tiny, proprietary and very expensive.  This probably explains the weak flash - there's very little power and Nikon needs to preserve it.  Plus, after about 30 seconds idle time, the camera hibernates to save the battery.  One has to press the shutter and wait about 5 seconds for it to revive each time.Fourth, while outdoor exposure has been good, the LED screen is too weakly backlit to view at the beach or ski slope.  And there's no optical viewfinder, so you often can't see what you're photographing in these circumstances.Fifth, one must swivel the lens assembly open in order to use the camera.  When doing this, it's very easy to put a fingerprint over the fixed transparent lens cover.  And a little bit of smudge on that cover gives plenty of artifact on the pictures.Finally, while I shoot at the unit's maximum resolution, it's still not acceptable to press the shutter button and wait two seconds before it takes the shot - and then wait another 3 or 4 seconds for it to be ready for the next. And if the flash is involved, that adds another 2 seconds before the picture is taken. Like I said, I was looking for family snapshots; but far too many pictures have the subject moved out of the frame because of these delays.So, this camera is okay for some things - especially outdoor daylight shots that are not too bright.  But my 35mm performs a lot better in many circumstances.  And its Costco-developed pictures are about 30% the cost of those from a digital camera.  And I don't have to spend hours engineering Photoshop corrections, or burning the images to archival CD.If I had it to do over again, I'd be more fussy about cycle time, battery capacity, flash distance from lens and exposure latitude. Live and learn.","Date":"March 19, 2003"}

{"Title":"Not for Flash Photos","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1HNZ6XD5XQ575","Overall":"bad","Content":"If you take lots of indoor flash pictures, this is probably not the camera to choose.Irrespective of the other attributes of this camera (whether it can be bounced on the floor and survive, whether it takes reasonable outdoor still pictures, macros, has lots of scene modes, etc.)  this camera should be avoided if you intend to take lots of photos of people indoors using the built-in flash.I find that severe red eye is practically inevitable with this camera, even if one uses the anti-red eye flash setting on the camera, and one has to retouch practically all flash pictures of people.  In addition, flash pictures indoors will sometimes show white filled-in circles, located at random throughout the photo.  They may ruin the photo depending on their location in the image.These problems have been mentioned by  other reviewers, both in this forum and in other camera discussion forums. Both problems have been attributed by many to the location of the flash, which is immediately adjacent to the lens.Problems with the Nikon CoolPix 2500 flash (and probably with the 3500, which is the 3 megapixel version of this camera) are very real, and if lots of your pictures involve photos of people indoors with a flash, this is not the camera for you (unless you intend to spend time with photo editing software).","Date":"August 17, 2003"}

No one in their tech department would admit to having heard of this problem before, and no one could give me even a professional guess for a diagnosis.  I thought it might be my battery and searched at no less than 15 different camera and electronics stores for a replacement.  You can't find that battery anywhere other than online.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the battery.  After mailing the camera back to Nikon for service, I received an estimate that it would cost $130 to fix the camera.  Still, there was no description of what the problem was.  Why would I pay $130 to repair this defective camera, when I could buy a new one for the same price?

{"Title":"Awkward To Use","Author":"Orome \"Aldaron\"","ReviewID":"R3L6OYZPTAJ5B8","Overall":"bad","Content":"Though adequate as a replacement for an APS pocket point-and-shoot, this camera has several drawbacks that should give pause. The too-clever signature Coolpix \"twist\" to expose the lens takes just that much longer and is just that much more fiddly than simply removing a lens cap--and one misses too many photos as a result. A sliding cover would have served much better, especially one that also turns the camera on. (The twist doesn't turn the camera on, that's a distinct step.) Controls, menus, and features are generally good, as is the LCD, but the power switch is easy to leave in the wrong state and is poorly constructed. Sadly, the real failing of this camera is its image quality. Maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges, but when I bought this as an easier to carry substitute for my Olympus C-3040Z I was prepared to loose some quality for the sake of convenience. However I was not prepared for the glaring failings I encountered. First off, Nikon compresses its highest quality images more than is necessary. Far worse are the strange washed-out or saturated colors I get with this camera. In side by side comparisons between my two digital cameras, where the Olympus produces striking results, the Nikon's are consistently over-saturated and blurry. I have taken both cameras on several trips, and find myself discarding almost every shot taken with the Nikon, even when I have no equivalent from my Olympus.Overall, a convenience not worth the disappointment.","Date":"May 6, 2003"}

{"Title":"Some nice features but...","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2GO9NSCIWH4JC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have noticed that a lot of the reviews for this camera mention taking shots of flowers, landscape, etc.  I think this camera would be excellent for those applications.  However, having gone through 3 digital cameras of varying price and quality, I would suggest a good old 35 mm if you are planning to take photos of children, pets, anything that moves.  If you've never used digital, I think this one is too expensive to use as a starter camera.  Start with something less expensive and decide whether you want to dedicate yourself to digital before you spend several hundred dollars on this camera.  I went digital when I had a baby, and can honestly say that my best photos have come from the many disposable cameras I've bought when I've been fed up with blurry pictures.  I do like the docking station this one has, which makes it easy to transfer photos and charge the battery.  If you're set on digital and know it can meet your needs, I think this is a good choice.  Easy to customize exposure, color, sharpness, shutter speed.  But those new to digital and looking to take action photos (action includes a child stacking blocks or even just turning his head) should start with something lower-end, or buy from a store with a good return policy.  I just don't think the convenience of digital (especially a relatively expensive digital like this one) outweighs the quality of film.  Good luck whatever you decide!","Date":"October 15, 2002"}

{"Title":"My first review at Amazon","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2JMGYC82RJ7NP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I'm suprised that there are a lot of people who liked this camera.  I had a Nikon Coolpix 800 (only 2MP) that my daughter dropped and broke so I had to invest in a new digital camera.After looking around this one seemed like a sweet deal.  4MP and it got pretty decent reviews.  However, there were a couple scathing reviews from people who had previous experience with digital cameras.  I have to say, those people have it right.  Most of the good reviews have to be coming from people who are just jumping into the digial world.This Kodak camera is horrible.  The pictures were a grainy mess and when compared with my Nikon 2MP pictures the overall colors and quality were less impressive.I've sent this camera back to Amazon, and am going to invest the money to get a camera with a higher quality lens.","Date":"August 12, 2002"}

First, Kodak actually took away features such as video capture which used to be available in the 2.0 megapixel model.  Second, the camera has a charging defect.  I had to send the camera in for repairs because the battery would not charge.  Third, the camera has a shutter defect.  After a few months, my photos were overexposed and blurry.  Again sent camera in for repairs.  Kodak fixed the problem temporarily.  Finally, a few months later my photos were double exposed and blurry.  Kodak would not repair the camera for free because it was out of warrantee. The people at Kodak were nice but their policies suck.  Based on the other reviews I have seen on Amazon, it is obvious that this camera should have been recalled.Bottom line - DO NOT TOUCH THIS CAMERA!  In fact, I would not recommend you buy a Kodak until they improve their customer service and post sales record.","Date":"June 25, 2004"}

Motion shots were lacking, but I thought I could live with it because inside low-light shots were good and that is what I needed. But then the problems started on day 2,  the little shutter lens wont open all the way most of the time now, so the pictures are all dark or black.  Every once in a while it will work okay and I can get in a fairly good picture although a little grainy, but it is too frustrating to fight with.  I wish I had read the reviews before buying!I like the features if they worked right, and this could just be an individual camera thing since it was used, but I really believe durability is a key factor.I have a Vivitar 1.2mp I have had for 3 years that works better than this piece of junk. Will try to get the shutter fixed at a camera place,but probably will end up taking the loss and buying the camera I really wanted in the first place..the Cannon Powershot A75.However I will say that my brother has a Kodak Easyshare 3.1mp and his camera has been great for him for a year now.

For the first few months everything seemed to work fine until the battery went down... subsequent efforts at using several types of rechargable batteries only revealed that you can only get about 10 pictures from a freshly charged set of batteries.  Increasingly frustrating is that you the photos were also overexposed and blury because I guess the batteries couldn't support the focus motor or something.  Anyway, complete waste of money if you ask me.  After reading many Amazon reviews I'm even doubting the 3.5 star rating that Amazon carries for this camera... I've seen too many 1's to see anything over a net 2 on this.  Futhermore... most of the positive reviews that I've read are written by folks who have only owned the camera for a couple weeks or a few days (not enough time to experience the let down that everyone else is deals with after using the camera for several months).Also, the photo transfer software locked up my 1GB RAM computer when pulling more that 40 photos across... the docking station is the biggest rip off as well, since using the USB connection is just as easy ($70 more wasted).","Date":"July 18, 2005"}

Doubrava","ReviewID":"R1QW5MTSJ3AR3D","Overall":"bad","Content":"Upon recommendation from friends and reading reviews at the time, we purchased the Kodak DX4900.  The camera takes pretty good pictures and the software is fun to use to edit pictures. We have been disappointed in the battery life/or whatever is causing \"dead camera\" problem.  Recently, after communicating with Kodak, we found out that you are not suppose to keep your camera on the dock unless you shoot pictures every day.  \"It decreases the life of the battery\".  Nice to find this out over 1 year later.  We cannot take more than 6-10 pictures then the camera shuts down; sometimes you can tweak 2-3 pictures out by popping the battery out and putting back in.  We have done all the correct battery charges, bought several rechargable batteries and still continue to have problems.  It is very frustrating to have spent $500.00+ on the camera, batteries, dock and memory cards to have these kind of problems.  And the solution is to have them fix it for $150-200.00, trade it in for a comparible model--DX6340 (for $216.00 plus the cost of a new dock and memory cards) or to get rid of the Kodak brand (eat all the money invested) and get something better.  After the many negative reviews, especially about the battery problems and the service issue with Kodak...we probably will go with the latter.  If you decide to buy this camera...advice...get the extended warranty...or you may be sorry.","Date":"January 6, 2004"}

The 4 MP doesn't give enough picture quality. 4MP is just a marketing thing, its actual quality is more like 2MP.2. Visible purple fringing/ chromatic aberrations.3. LCD monitor is not good, tough to see anything on in sunlight. Using a cheapish LCD helps drive profit margins higher for Kodak on this.4. Unacceptable time lag when veiewing on LCD.5. Takes more than 13 secs to write anything on the CF card. Even my last year's Fuji was much better than this !6. Poor viewing capabilites.7. You need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock. Why doesn't Kodak sell it along with camera itself ? After all it hardly worth 15 bucks !8. Missing features like movie/audio, Video out, atleast some manual controls etc. or atleast a 3x optical zoomI have compared this camera to other Canon/Sony ones and find this way below on quality/features compared to them. I see that many people here have a 5 star review for this, but then maybe its their first experience with a digicam. Kodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras. Buy a Canon S200 or S330 or A40 and you will be much more happy. They have much more features and have very good metallic bodies. Don't buy this plastic junk. Look all the freebies that Kodak is throwing in to sell this :)I know I will not be very pouplar in my harsh review about this cheapie but I prefer to be candid.","Date":"May 26, 2002"}

However, this purchase proved me very wrong.-In 80% of my photos, the highlights burn out, no matter which exposure, white balance, or quality setting I use.  All of my photos seem very contrasted and there is no way to adjust this.-The Digital Zoom is worthless - it just blows up the image by pixelating it, so you never get a sharp image.-The veiwfinder does not match what the lense sees, so you have to remember to center the camera an inch or two above where you really want it.-There is no way to manually focus the camera.  It focuses on the closest thing to it.  It would be nice to have a manual aperture setting, like the white balance and exposure settings.The good things this camera has going for it are the EasyShare Photo Dock and the EasyShare Travel Kit (both purchased separately).  It was very easy and fast to load the photos from the camera to my computer.  The Travel Kit has a variety of interchangable power plugs and quickly charges the batteries.I would not recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for manual/artistic control in a digital camera.","Date":"August 28, 2002"}

I immediately noticed that the viewfinder was out of focus, but initially, I assumed that it was my own eyesight, or a smudge on the lens, or that there was a focus adjustment I hadn't found, so I used the camera for about a week before deciding to return it for an exchange.When I went to exchange it, we discovered that all five additional cameras in stock also had out-of-focus viewfinders !  It was verified by the store's sales people.So i simply got a refund.I like the features of the D-520, and the digital version of the pictures always turned out well; but it was just too irritating to be looking at a blurry image through the viewfinder when trying to frame the shots. How difficult can it be for a camera design to make sure the viewfinder focuses properly ?.....especially a company of Olympus' reputation !  That is why i wasn't more critical of the flaw when I first noticed it.The sales manager said he was contacting Olympus and returning all his defective stock.  So I will probably just wait and see if Olympus solves this quality control problem and perhaps buy another D-520 unless I find something I like better in the interim.  If you are thinking of a D-520, be certain to check the viewfinder very critically.  It is just irritating to have the subject always out-of-focus when taking pictures, even if the digital version comes out looking good.","Date":"May 27, 2002"}

I had a pretty cheap digital olympus that lasted me about 3 years and I loved it. No fancy modes, no high-tec fancy smancy mumbo jumbo... not that I wouldn't like a high-tec camera, just that I don't particularly need it. I just want a camera that allows me to take a few hundred pictures at a time, for trips with friends and the family, for soccer games, for concerts, the beach...ect... My old reliable camera broke last summer after I got thousands of great pictures out of it, and so for the last x-mas my mother (who didn't do much research, but with good intentions) bought me this PIECE OF CRAP...If you like all the fancy ways to take pictures- there is a tiny possibility you might like this camera... It has all that...somewhat... no wait... not at all...It maintains a pretense that its high-tec, but it's really just a piece of crap.When I first got it I brought it with me on my trip to Paris and I was highly dissapointed that after I shot a picture it took literally 15-20 seconds for the flash to re-whatever and let me take another one. I missed about 70% of the pictures I wanted to take, and whenever people posed in my pictures- it took about 5 minutes for my camera to \"let\" me take the picture. NO CANDID SHOTS here.Then halfway through the trip, I'd turn on the camera, the screen would pop up, I'd try to take a picture, the orange and green lights would flash and then it would simply turn off... I looked through the manuel and it says that this is simply a problem with the batteries (although the battery symbol came up as full) and so I bought a fresh pack and re-loaded them. And of course it continued to flash and turn off..I'm not done- I took it to a camera shop, and the guy had no idea what was wrong- I missed pictures of half my Paris trip, a concert ,  and a beach trip with my friends all because of this horrible joke-of-a-camera.- I also spent the equivolent of the price of this piece of crap on disposable cameras that gave me horrible pictures.BIG TIP- If you have a son or daughter and you're buying them a camera DO NOT buy this one just-because it's cheap(in case I haven't made myself clear), because they will hate it and resent you for not researching or caring about it...","Date":"June 26, 2004"}

I had owned an earlier generation Olympus Camedia so I did not hesitate to purchase the D-520 zoom as a pocket camera for quick snaps of our newborn daughter to email the grandparents.  Easy to carry in a pant pocket, quality digital pictures, right?WRONG.I have a simple expectation of a camera...point it at an object, push a button, and capture the image.  The D-520 only occasionally takes the picture when you push the button, sometimes not responding at all.  When you have your infant sitting beside her dog, smiling, both dog and daughter looking at the camera, you have a very limited window of opportunity to snap the shot.  The D-520 fails miserably.I have no problems with the quality of the pictures taken, but the response time on the camera between pushing the button and the camera taking the picture is painfully slow.  I have missed so many shots, while waiting for the camera to decide that it is ready to take a picture, that I have plan to chuck the whole camera into a landfill somewhere.  Worthless digital disaster.My suggestion, get a 35mm and never miss a candid shot again.","Date":"December 25, 2003"}
{"Title":"Not a good camera for indoors shots","Author":"JR","ReviewID":"RCDTCED0XV7CW","Overall":"bad","Content":"I own three (3) Olympus digital cameras (D-360Z, C-730UZ, & D-520) and I cannot recommend the D-520 camera. It has an unbelievably long flash cycle time that makes it almost useless for indoor shooting. I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds after taking two or three pictures on fresh rechargeable batteries! (and I buy Olympus batteries) If you're at a graduation or other event you basically have one chance to get a picture because your child will be off the stage and back to their seat before the flash recycles and you can take another picture. It also seems to think you need a flash in bright sunlight and so you have to manually turn the flash off if you want to take pictures outside and not wait for a flash that you don't need to recycle.My Olympus D-360Z never had a problem like this. I thought the D-520 would be a better camera but it isn't. Perhaps its because there are only two batteries instead of the 4 that the D-360Z and C-730UZ have. When you do finally get to take a picture the pictures are crisp and clear with good color balance. I tend to use this camera for outdoor shots only and I keep the flash turned off. If you do a lot of indoor shooting, you may be disappointed with this camera.","Date":"December 17, 2003"}
{"Title":"Not too crazy about this camera...","Author":"Sarah Mascara","ReviewID":"REZLU29H4CADH","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned this camera for over a year and I had issues with it right out of the box.  I was looking for a good digicam to replace my Fujifilm FinePix A101, which was and still is a great litte camera, but lacked an optical zoom and was a mere 1.3 megapixels.  After a trip to England with the A101, I decided to get a higher end point and shoot camera with optical zoom and higher resolution.  Having done a bit of research, I settled on the Olympus D-520, which had just come down in price.  I had owned an Olympus 35mm camera which lasted me for several years and was FANTASTIC, so I thought I'd be getting the same level of quality in the digicam.  Boy was I disapointed!The first thing that bothered me was the sound of the gears almost straining when the clamshell is pulled back and the lens protracts.  I was a bit worried that something was wrong with it, but it turns out that that's how all the D-520's sound when they're turned on or off.  My 35mm Olympus had a similar clamshell front, but the sound of it opening and closing was extremely quiet.  It also had a metal body, whereas the D-520 has a plastic case.  I think Olympus was looking to skimp in the design and engineering deptartments with the D-520!The next problem I encountered was how fickle it was when taking photos.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I miss about 75% of photo oportunities when I use this camera.  The lag between photos feels like eons, especially since speedy recouperation is essential for point and shoot cameras.  The D-520 is EXTREMELY picky about when and where it wants to take pictures... If light levels are not perfect, or if you're too close or too far away from the object you're trying to capture, IT WILL NOT TAKE THE PICTURE.  Period.  Once again, you're talking a lot of missed photo ops and impatient people posing for a camera that refuses to take a picture.This camera does well on auto-timer mode, though.  Sometimes it's the only way I can get it to take a picture, unfortunately.  It offers a 12 second timer, which is a few seconds longer than most other cameras, and you typically end up with plenty of time to set it up and get situated.Nighttime or photos shot with minimal light don't look great.  They're not terrible, but they could be a whole lot better.  In low-lighting situations, the flash can really tweak the quality of the picture, so you have to be on your guard.  The nighttime flash option does well in low light situations, though it tends to illuminate everything in what looks like daylight.Resolution is passable.  2.3 megapixels is probably good enough for someone new to the digicam experience, but over time, it seemed as though the quality of the resolution was degrading.  Or maybe that was just my patience with the camera...Some people complain that this camera is not intuitive to use.  I'd say that that's probably the least of the problems with the D-520.  My 10 year old nephew was able to master the basic functions of this camera after a minute or two, so it's not that hard to figure out.  It's just not as obvious as some other cameras on the market.In closing, I really don't care for this camera.  I feel as though Olympus could have done a whole heck of a lot better, but it's made me very warry of ever purchasing another Olympus digicam.  Now that it's over a year old, the D-520 is quite affordable, but I'd recommend going with a Fujifilm camera in the same price range, as I've always been very happy with my Fujifilm cameras.","Date":"December 11, 2003"}

It is not intuitive to use, and i have to explain to friends how to turn on the display screen or review a picture everytime.  Once you know it's not terrible but there are other problems.  The display doesn't come on when you turn the camera on - you have to turn it on yourself.  Of course, you don't need it on - you can never turn it on and shoot everything as if it was a normal camera - then just look at the pictures on your computer.  However most of us like to play with these a little more and show our friends pictures right after we take them.  This just makes it a little more difficult to do that.  This should not be a deal breaker though.I've had substantial trouble with indoor photography however.  If you think the flash issue that everyone talks about won't be an issue for you, think again.  You'll take this to one wedding and miss every shot you want.  On top of that, most of the pictures will come out dark and out of focus.  Basically indoor pictures are just out.  But outdoor, it works fine.The part I was happiest with was the software that came with it.  The program to download and edit your photos was oppositely extremely intuitive and easy to use.  I wish the camera had been designed the same way.All in all, the problem with indoor photograhy is a deal breaker.  It's otherwise so small and easy to point and click (not using the LCD) that it's too bad it comes with these other problems.","Date":"October 22, 2003"}

It takes good pictures with a steady hand and some Zen magic--sharp, clear, and best of all, it can take macro pictures. There is a problem with blurring, however, as it is impossible to hold this camera still while you wait for the depressor to finish exposure. The sliding opening mechanism, which turns the camera on, flies open in your bag or pocket--there is nothing to hold it closed. This drains the battery. Worse yet, this mechanism broke, came loose, and the camera stopped working altogether. New batteries last for about 4 pictures, then you have to change them. I'd put your money into a better design with battery power and a better depressor.","Date":"December 7, 2002"}

I'm getting a pattern on my images that looks a little like what one sees with video cameras in dark rooms, the images are slightly blurry, the images have inconsistent tones with patches of pink - purple - blue - black - etc. This would say to me that although its high resolution array, the per pixel tone is shabby.. I've seen better pixtures coming from my brother's Kodak digital camera with a similar pixel resolution. There is no way to adjust image loss (what if its set to Jpeg's default of 85?).. Also its a macro lens, dispuportionate images, stuff at the edge is blurry.. Flash direction is not adjustable.. Its only been an hour that I've had it, I'm thinking about sending it back.. And yes it was quick to get the software setup, download from USB is quick, About 8 seconds or so to download from a 8 meg card (USB is usually about 800K a second), I got about 20 images out of the camera in low light, tried flash white balance, incadescent white balance and auto, tried with flash, tried without, tried light metering settings, in all cases (except where there was overexposure) the blackish areas and greyish areas were multi-colored without a continuous tone over large areas where there should be say white or gradations of black, and so forth.. If you really don't care about your images, or find as much beauty in single shots from a video camera, you will be okay with this camera, but forget about using it for photo-quality work.Hey I haven't tried it in sunlight, I took pictures at 10 at night, so its probably a different camera in the day time. I compared all images to images my brother took with his camera in low light.","Date":"August 30, 2002"}

Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously.I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera. I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features.What I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus. You might say, well I can live with the low light, I COULD NOT! I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light. And my pictures were fuzzy. NOT good Fuji! Did you rush this one out the door or what.After calling Fuji's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it.(Being in denial I thought, maybe I was doing something wrong, because this camera had the zoom I really wanted.) I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal.I got back on the Net and this time I noticed the Canon PowerShot A40. (It has 3x optical and 2.5 digital zoom, not the greatest, but decent). I really liked its reviews and decided I could live with the difficult manual and operation until I learned the camera if it meant I would be getting a good camera. PLUS, this camera has \"MOVIE capabilty, Sound and 4 different picture modes. I went into ... and they demo'ed it for me and even printed off pictures for me. I had them set it for me for an event this evening and I was able to use it right out of the box, tonight I'm learning the ins and outs. I LOVE THIS CAMERA! It is so cool being able to get a 30 second video on my camera without tugging along my hefty camcorder. It really is great for short movie clips. I plan to email them to friends tomorrow.And the picture quality is excellent, when I took my pictures earlier today I did not like the way a couple of them came out so I called ...and they told me I could adjust the color by adjusting the setting (choice of lighting about 6 settings from cloudy, flouresent, etc), worked like a charm. And the prints are just awesome.What I learned: Listen to the negative comments from owners, they can be right. Then ask yourself, if your camera turns out to have those problem, can you live with it and be satisfied?More importantly, go to a camera store to demo and buy a camera! I had never did this before because I felt they would be more expensive based on the expensive models I saw in Sunday's papers, my camera cost $..., which is about what I can get it off the Net. BUT, in the store (given you have a knowledgable sales person helping you), you can get quick information and demo's to help you make your decision. And getting the pictures printed off in ... was just too sweet! BTW; if you do this and your prints do not come out right, the store model settings have probably been played with by shoppers like you and me -lol. So its great to have someone there who KNOWS camera's and is not just SELLING them!Regardless to what you get, be flexible and be ready to quickly return the camera if you are not satisfied to find what you really want!

{"Title":"Excellent compact camera.... but has major problem.","Author":"superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"","ReviewID":"R3NO6Q0JABKF5R","Overall":"bad","Content":"Quick Update : The picture quality of this camera is horrible. Too many blurred and/or out of focus pictures. Had to sell off my S200 because it can't take sharp/crisp/clear pictures even in daylight ! Many other users on dpreview forums have same problems & Canon hasn't released any firmware update to fix it. My suggestion now is to avoid S200/S230/A40 because of focus problems. My old review continues below :Canon has another winner in its new S200 model just like the S110 and S100. It has the following positives,1. Excellent looks/build quality.2. Great night shots, not found on any other compact 6 oz. camera, new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto 15 secs (tripod a must for this).3. Very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the world, PAL/NTSC video out, all cables included (unlike Sony).4. Accepts cheaper Compact Flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto 256MB. Not expensive 64MB sticks here :)5. Very much pocketable. Easily goes into any pocket.6. 2.1 MP may looks low compared to other 3/4 MP cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks ! Don't just use MPixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera. If you won't print them bigger than 8x10\" then 2MP should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash :) Also Canon can't have a 3MP on the Elph's since they have to sell their S30/S40 also !7. 2x zoom very faster to start and fold back. Works smoothly. You can turn the digital zoom off permanently.8. LCD is superb, pictures look great on the 1.5\" LCD. (a bigger 1.8\" LCD on other need not neccessarily mean better quality, my last years Fuji had 1.8\" and comes no where near this 1.5\")10. I haven't encountered any problems downloading pics till now. I don't see any reason to buy a CF card reader, the included cable works fine took just 3 mins for 100 big pictures11. Comparing this with S330 is really very tough. S330 is heavy and feels rock solid, looks even better than S200 and has 3x zoom. S200 because of its light weight and smaller significantly smaller size is better to carry around. Play with both in your local store before deciding between the two.11. Great user interface... think of these Elph's as Nokia's of digicams. Other cheaper camera's out there might not have same reliability, features, user interface and picture quality.Things that could be better,1. Only 2x Zoom, Canon needs to get this up to 3x next year. (And 4x on S330's replacement).2. Battery... you might have to buy a second one for extra 45 bucks depending on your needs... I guess this is the case with any ultra compact camera3. The battery/CF doors feel flimsy.4. Canon's ZoomBrowser EX software is very unstable. It has crashed atleast 5 times in one week on Windows XP. also it takes long time to \"update its database\" whenever any pciture is deleted or addedd to the directory. Canon needs to iron out the problems in this. You may be better off using some other SW for editing/managing your pics, use this one just for downloading pics.5. Price is still high for a 2MP camera, although its become much more affordable than last year.6. Movie mode is almost useless because of 5 sec limit on decent sized clip. Its just a marketing thing.7. Included CF card is just 8MB ! Someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent 64MB card along with new cameras.8. Camera gets pretty hot in a few mins of use and the buttons on S200 feel tough to use compared to S330. This is part of the deal in buying a such compact camera.Spend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you won't regret ! Getting a camera this compact has some compromises but well worth the ultra portability you get.","Date":"May 5, 2002"}

Can it really take pictures? - looks more like a toy. Then you look at the user's manual and you are amazed by its thickness - all this for a point & shoot camera? As you read through it you find it hard to comprehend that so many features are included in such a small package - technology has certainly progressed!And then you take your first picture. It's not good, so you take a second, then a third, then you fill the weak 8mb flash card supplied with the Elph with test pictures. None of them are good. They're either out of focus, or too contrasty, or the background has been `washed out'. Almost all are badly framed too. What gives? So you go back to the user's manual and re-read and start trying different settings, combinations and shooting techniques. Eventually you manage to produce a really nice picture. Then you realize you have *worked* for it.The S200 Elph has wrongly been touted as an entry-level camera. Its picture quality in auto-mode-point-and-shoot is nothing to write home about. Lens flare is way, way pronounced (cheap optics, in plain English). To get good photos you have to plan and compose carefully. Which, in my mind, defeats the purpose of going for this camera. It is supposed to be *practical*. Size aside, it's no more practical than all digital cameras. You shoot, you download, there's the picture. They all do that, and it's the reason we have come to love them. Doesn't mean we have to have bad photos.There are other gripes, many pointed out even in the positive reviews: problematic flash, shutter lag, no camera case, no battery life indicator, inadequate zoom factor, weak software. But all these pale into insignificance compared to the main problem: Picture quality. This is so essential, I don't see why we should even bother with other shortcomings. After all we take pictures because we expect them to come out beautiful, don't we? I do. If you think like me, pass on the Elph. If, on the other hand, the beauty of the camera is important, get the Elph. It's small and techno-loaded, it's shiny and oh-so-cute. It delivers big in the `cool' category. Just don't ask it to deliver pictures.","Date":"June 30, 2003"}

{"Title":"bad","Author":"RF","ReviewID":"R2RHH9GPR4Y88B","Overall":"bad","Content":"Pictures are very noisy(grainy) and colors are inaccurate.  Many fine textures and details such as woodgrain are almost completely lost.  Lowering ISO settings help reduce the noise, but it is still there.  Software bundle is pathetic.  It's pretty much just a driver.  Upsides are that the camera is easy to learn and use, it has an AF-assist lamp, it's not locked in Auto like some other cameras, and good rechargable AA's and a so-so charger is included in the box(some sony cams leave this out).  Addressing the person who complained that the camera flashes several times before the shot is taken, THAT IS WHAT REDEYE REDUCTION DOES!  Those flashes shrink your pupils which is one of the common ways that redeye is reduced.  If you don't like it, then turn it off, it doesn't get simpler than that.  Never had a problem with the screen going blank.  This was one of the first digital cameras that I used and I took about 400 pictures with it - I wish all those shots I took with it were taken with a traditional 35mm camera instead, as the results would have been much better.","Date":"September 19, 2004"}

Of course as soon as the warranty expired, it had problems. The first thing that happened (and also happened exactly to a cousin of mine with exact camera) was that you could no longer run USB cord directly from camera to computer. Tried on 3 computers, and it just would not work. I had to go buy a memory stick reader to transfer pictures. Second, the LCD showed nothing but black and menu items. (such as if flash were on, the date and time, pic quality, etc.) Also could not take pictures using it the old fashion way, as the pic would be pure black when put on computer. Called Sony, tried for 2 hours to get working. Sony finally told me to send it to them and they would fix it.......for a flat rate of $176.00 plus shipping to and back from Texas!!!!!  If I beat it on my hand, the LCD picture comes back so you can take a picture.  Keep in mind that this camera was ALWAYS well cared for, until it stopped working and in desperation I hit it and the LCD came back on!I would recommend a different brand.

Presto!The camera started working, the LCD screen came on and I was able to take pictures and review them. Thanks to the reviewers who mentioned hitting the camera.Until today, I dreaded the thought of having to purchase another camera after only 2 years use. I have too much invested in memory sticks, Nimh batteries, & a reader.  I just hope it continues to work. Sony should recognize the fact that this camera (DSC-P51) definitely has a problem.Overall when it worked, I was pleased with its easy to use features, giving it 5 stars.

I researched all of the 2MP cameras in the price range and determined that the P51 had the best value/features.  The camera was a great performer, and I recommended it to three of my friends, who all bought one.  Starting about a year later, my camera started to flicker when in camera mode.  Soon after it would go completely black, and would not capture any pictures.  It didn't take long for me to figure out that a little tough love(smacking) would bring it back to life.  It has been this way ever since.  Now I find out that all three of my friends who purchased the same camera are having the same problem to varying degrees.  Two of them flicker and still respond to a good whack, while the third is completely dead.The problems seems to be related to the lens, or the connection between it and the lcd.  I have been in contact with sonys technical support, and they say that they have never heard of the problem(yeah, right) and recommended that I send it in for service.  If search the internet for \"sony p51 black screen\", you will see that this camera obviously has a defect and should be recalled. Given that I have also had several other sony products fail within two years of purchase,  I for one will boycott sony and their products for the rest on my consumer lifetime, and will actively encourage others to do the same.I am certain that this is the only form of communication that sony is capable of understanding.","Date":"November 1, 2004"}

I kick myself that I didn't take it back to Circuit City before the warrantee period ended.  I've been battling this camera for over a year now thinking, \"maybe it's just me, maybe I don't haven't learned how to use it yet\".  Because sometimes the pictures turn so amazingly well, I told myself the camera has such potential, I just have to figure out it's quirks.  Slowly that feeling melted away as my fustration got hotter and hotter, the Sony DSC-P51 that I bought is unpredictable.  There are some examples below.  I called technical support and spoke with a very polite/business like person who told me to reset the camera settings back to factory default.  But he was not able to grasp the problems that I was having.  He lacked the experience with the camera to quickly understand what I was talking about, and so I have erected this web page to help myself and other Sony DSC-P51 pre-owners & owners to understand the issues.If you have comments, similar experiences, examples, send an EMAIL so I can post them on this page.

{"Title":"They almost got it right","Author":"B. Vongrabe \"vongrabe\"","ReviewID":"R2FVHYRI59T85Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"The truth is this camera is unfit for the purpose intended. To begin with , while the built-in screen freezes the picture at the time of taking it, the actual picture is recorded approx. 1 second later. No problem when you work in a studio with models, for sport or any animated subject it leaves composition to chance. Highly annoying.Next, the camera controls are maximum user-unfriendly. After 3 months of operation, I was unable to figure out how to adjust exposure (or at least turn auto-exposure off). For example, when you use the camera for document scanning (for example to speed up document conversion into digital files) with lots of white paper and 20% text, it adjusts the image too dark. While the usual text scanner software (I use Caere), works with it notwithstanding, the image shows a medium to dark brown background. That is the case even when you set it on manual.This does not happen in normal operation, though: in fact, color, exposure (even under difficult lighting conditions) and resolution is excellent in real life situations; they are nearly perfect. If the image would be recorded at the time the button is pushed the camera would be ok.Next, the camera does not have a remote control. While for regular photography it may seem unimportant, in a repro-stand, or for that matter in studio photography, a remote would come in handy.Finally, the mechanical design is Mickey Mouse. After inserting approx. 5 times over three months the 1394 cable into the camera-based connector, the connector disappeared somewhere inside the camera and can no longer be found, a gaping hole is there instead. I did not even use one of the heavily shielded 1394 cables. When it was working before the connector disappeared, though, the camera provided excellent moving picture results for Internet (cable) communications.It is a pitty that an excellent concept was executed so poorly.","Date":"December 22, 2002"}
{"Title":"This camera will drive you insane!","Author":"Bill","ReviewID":"R99VS5HGN9YDJ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I read the user warnings:  impossible low light autofocus, poor manual focus with no distance indicator, battery eater, buttons on the side can't be found when you need them but always hit by accident, no filter threads.  I thought, \"It's a Nikon.  Must be operator problems.\"  I was wrong.This camera has a good flash and works well with Nikon external flash units, but there's a catch.  The camera will not focus under conditions when you normally need a flash!  No focus assist light, and the manual focus...you've got to be kidding:  Hold down a button on the side of the camera while turning a knurled wheel on top.  Under really bright conditions, you can sort-of tell when the image is in focus, but under those conditions, you probably don't need manual focus.  If you think maybe you'll just estimate the distance under dim light and dial it in, well guess what?  The focus distance indicator is a bar which slides between a flower and a mountain.  How's that for precision measurement!Yep, it eats batteries.  Buy two spares ($$ ouch!) and a rapid charger plus a car adapter.  You'll always have batteries on you mind when you use this camera.  You can turn off Continuous Autofocus and reduce battery drain, and noise, significantly, though.I found a press-on adapter for $25 to use standard threaded filters.  That helped, but should not have been necessary on a $900 camera.And just wait till you hit the file type button by mistake--and discover you've changed from Fine (JPEG) to RAW, and have to wait 45 seconds for the 15MB file to save to CF, while you scratch your head trying to figure out what happened.Yes, the menus are a little complex and mastering the extensive feature set may take a while, but that's to be expected with this many features, although some would be better placed for quick access.  Built-in macro focusing is good, too, but an aperture smaller than F8--at least F11 or F16--might give the depth of field you need for close-up photography.  The 8:1 zoom is nice, with 35mm  equivalent of 280mm, but the wide angle end is weak with only 35mm wide angle instead of the more usefull 28mm equivalent.  And given the price of this camera, image stabilization should be included for hand-holding the telephoto zoom.But it's the low light focus that will drive you screaming into the night.  A helper pointing a small flashlight or a laser pointer at your subject will help the camera to focus (you'll get used to the Canon people laughing at you), but you'll still be guessing on the composition, since the viewfinder display goes nearly black in low light.  If Nikon could at least update the firmware to display manual focus distance in feet--that would be a help, but just try and contact anyone interested!  You get referred to the incredibly lame FAQs and \"knowledge base\" every time!If you really want the precision framing of TTL viewfinders on a digital, save your money for a true digital SLR.","Date":"September 14, 2003"}
{"Title":"Maybe I Got A Lemon","Author":"B. Mullins \"Digital Rebel\"","ReviewID":"R17UFTL5GLJFAG","Overall":"bad","Content":"After reading all of the reviews, I had high expectations for this camera.  While the menus are very complicated, and seemingly needlessly so, they can be mastered.  But the camera  doesn't seem to  be able to easily retain settings, despite following the manual as closely as possible. Battery life is quite short, despite not using the LCD screen or flash, and I couldn't find anyone that has additional batteries in stock.Other issues involved the camera's failure to connect to my computer [an iMac], although Nikon help desk couldn't figure out why.  ....My previous digicam, a Canon A20, has performed flawlessly, and in fact took pictures as good--if not often better at the same outdoor event as this Nikon.  I am not a high-end professional, nor do I think you should have to be one to produce superior results with this camera.  I bought it specifically to be able to control the exposure more, i.e. shutter speed, along with a reduced \"shutter lag.\"So far, I'm disappointed on all counts, even allowing for my lack of sophistication when it comes to high-end digital photography.  The LCD screen is almost unconscionably small, which is housed in a much larger flip-out panel that could easily accomodate a larger one.  To me this is an indication of the haphazard approach Nikon has made with this particular camera, having had no other experience with Nikon previously.  I strongly recommend you try this out in person, and then make sure everything works before any time elapses.","Date":"September 21, 2002"}

A quick google search reveals that this is a chronic problem with this and other Nikon models (the lens gearing in Nikon cameras is evidently quite fragile), so I don't know if it is worth trying to have it repaired.  Additionally, the flash on this camera has never functioned (it never would pop up), although the camera always thinks that it needs the flash even in the brightest daylight, so it never takes any pictures at all (instead showing a cryptic \"SB\" error message when you press the shutter) unless the flash is first manually turned off.  As a workaround, I have always kept it in one of the \"user preset\" modes in which the flash was disabled.  I don't like to use the build-in flash anyway, so this was not a big deal for me, but the \"lens error\" is evidently fatal.  I now see many other user comments online about these same problems, and about Nikon's unresponsiveness on the issues.

{"Title":"Awful autofocus--NOT happy with it.","Author":"Matt \"mattfl1\"","ReviewID":"R32Y7S9B3O4IKN","Overall":"bad","Content":"I'm bringing this camera back in exchange for a Coolpix 4500 tomorrow.  The camera is well built, does produce high quality, sharp pictures and has a boatload of features, however the autofocus is horrid.  The autofocus doesn't work correctly in anything but bright sunlight.  If you're shooting inside under slightly darker than normal conditions, the autofocus just hunts.  It's very frustrating when you miss shot after shot because the camera is struggling to autofocus.  If you want to stay with the Nikon name, check out the 4500.  It's a far better performer.","Date":"September 7, 2002"}

{"Title":"Rendered useless by chronic failures","Author":"F. Cochran","ReviewID":"R1KKLN5CWG7AXB","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had a number of cameras in the CoolPix line, and been mostly delighted with them. Unfortunately, my experience with the 5700 has been a debacle. As for many who purchased this camera, the flash on mine stopped functioning a few months after I bought it for more than $1,000 when this model was relatively new. This rendered the camera useless, disabling all but one shooting mode. And since the feedback was just a cryptic blinking red light and a code \"SB\" (defined nowhere in the manual or online), it took forever to determine I hadn't simply activated the wrong setting--this was a defect that required repair. I sent it in under warranty in the nick of time and got it back about a month later. It worked for maybe two more months and failed again. Same story. Now it's out of warranty with the same problem, and it looks as if I'd get no more on e-Bay than it would cost me to repair this lemon. (Not that I could sell it, even repaired, with a clear conscience.) TERRIBLY frustrating and costly experience with the camera I bought to record my young son's childhood--now he's in kindergarten, I've had to rely on pictures from others, and those years are never coming back. Avoid the 5700. Please Nikon, don't do this to us again!","Date":"September 29, 2005"}

I was not a big user of the flash in the first place but it is a huge disappointment to have a problem with such a basic feature on a \"prosumer\" camera.  I have also had miserable results with the auto-focus in low light conditions.  This is another common complaint about this camera.  Now I wish that I had bought a Canon.","Date":"October 10, 2004"}

The picture you view through the electronic view finder, lags behind the real image, and it feel like what you see is being dragged across the viewer. In other words, for a fast moving scene, it is almost impossible. Another major draw back is a flare across the view finder.

{"Title":"Not a Camera for the Faint of Heart","Author":"DaveHerb","ReviewID":"R1J6WLS51NY6M2","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned this camera since it first came out in 2003, and since I'm not a qualified camera \"expert\", I want to give you my thoughts on this camera. I'm giving this review as someone who is relatively new to digital \"point-and-shoot\" photography...First and foremost, study the Nikon manual. Then study it some more. The controls are overwhelming at times, provided you are a neo-phyte like myself.Second, for exterior photography on the normal setting, this camera cannot be beat! It is exceptional. The images are clear, clean, and colors are spectacular. I've photographed NASCAR at the California Speedway, and other events like the Coronado Speed Festival, etc., and the outdoor shots look great. Now for the indoor-shooting...This is where the camera gets its two star rating from me. I do not know how to select the manual control on-the-fly. I've tried to set up controls to shoot indoor photography, but I don't have weeks and weeks to learn the settings. I've photographed people who are standing completely still, slightly moving (my kids), low lighting conditions, fair lighting conditions, and still cannot get proper images to come out.The indoor photography is pitiful, as the colors are yellowish, muted, and nearly 90% of the time, the images are all blurred. The pop-up light is only good for 5-8 feet at best. I took some special shots of people who were stationary, and it appeared that the photo looked \"good\" when zooming in and out with the control. When I downloaded the CF card to my PC, the images were always blurred and the colors were way off.Mind you, I'm not a camera professional like many of the reviewers here, but rather I'm just an average \"Joe\" who would like to have decent indoor pictures that looked natural and were not blurred.I would sell this thing on Ebay if I could get more than a few hundred dollars for it, but I've already invested over $1,200 for the snap-on lens adaptors and protective lens cover which keeps the retractable lens from getting damaged. I bought this from a company in Canada back in 2003.All in all I'm happy with the exterior photos, but am very, very, disappointed with indoor pictures. I guess this thing requires a lot of tweaking, and many, many hours of studying the little manual that Nikon has provided.I would stay away from this and save your money for the newer Digital SLR's. I've had this for over four years now, and just wanted to write a review based on my experiences with this camera.Just a thought...","Date":"October 19, 2007"}

A friend of mine let me play with his new 5700 to see what I think about it.I first asked him the price he paid and although it is abit on the high side, i dismissed it initially and went on to the test if really this camera does deliver relative to its price. Controls are well placed, a nikon quality i like and the materials used are top-notched. However image quality is not what I expected. I have seen and tried digicams from Olympus and Minolta and they have better color reproduction and image saturation. Even the Fuji S7000 seems to have better \"printed image than the Nikon and to think that the Fuji only sells for U$600.00.

My wife's has been sent in for repairs twice for the zoom lens not working.  I got mine out this morning to take a picture and the view finder and screen are both blank.

I used it to take pictures as the unofficial photographer at my sister's wedding last month.  The pictures turned out great!  For our first wedding anniversary, we went back to our honeymoon location.  I captured some excellent pictures there. On the flight home, I took some breathtaking pictures of clouds through the airplane window.  Halfway through the flight, the lens extender became loose. By the time we got to the airport, the ring around the lens had come just about completely off.  We went to a restaurant for dinner, and the camera would not even turn on.  It was as if the warrenty had just expired, so it fell apart. I thought perhaps the batteries had died.  I tried 3 different sets of new batteries.  That wasn't it.  Today I took the camera to a place I found on Fuji's website to get it fixed.  The technician knew what the problem was right away.  the screws holding that ring on got loose and fell inside the camera, frying the circuit board.  It will cost me $199 to get it fixed.

Like many things that seem too good to be true, it was. Almost exactly a year after purchase, in which it was used sparingly, the camera went dead - it just would not turn on. By the time I got it to a repair center, the 1 year warranty period was over. The estimated repair cost including tax is $150 - I can get a decent new 3.2 MP camera for that price these days.While it lasted, it took decent photos. The 6x zoom which was a big selling point of the camera was fairly useful. Focusing in low light was difficult. Overall it felt too light and plasticky. With the breakdown, I'll never buy a Fuji again.","Date":"December 3, 2004"}

I liked the audio with video feature, design, ease of use and reasonable quality of pictures, though it was always super sensitive to movement and many pictures blurred. During this time, I easily shot over 4000 pictures.  It began to flake out sometime last summer or autumn with the black screen described by many others and now it just refuses to turn on.I don't think that I will purchase a Fuji again, for a while at least, but purchase a Canon next.Note that I still have a Pentax SLR 35-mm camera that I bought in the 1970s, which cost about $400 at the time.

I used the camera very little during that period, and it was kept in excellent physical condition.  This year I started doing some shooting with it, and found that often the viewfinder display often come up blank, even with fresh batteries or running on the A/C adapter.  Some times it would display, sometimes it wouldn't... other times, the dsiplay would flash intermittently with bright horizontal lines.  Now, it fails consistently.  I read numerous user reviews on this product, and it's obvious to me that this problem is \"systemic\" with the 3800, and not the result of misuse, or associated with normal wear and tear problems.  It's a defective product.  Just Look at the number of \"no display\" and \"flashing display\" complaints here on Amazon... I lost count.  Fortunately for Fuji, this failure occurs just after the warranty period, has ended, and as far as I am aware, Fuji has never recalled this obviously defective camera, or... offered any form of reparation.  I will never purchase another Fuji product, and I will encourage my friends and associates to do the same.  Fuji used to be well a respected company, known for good products at good prices.  Sadly, that is no longer the case... and even sadder... I can't give the Fuji FinePix 3800 a \"0\" rating.  Al Campagna","Date":"December 21, 2006"}

It was working fine, I took couple of pictures and turned it off and then it never turned back on. Also from other reviews you will see the same engineering mistake. There is a small screw coming out and shorting the circuits and power. I called Fuji, they told me to send it to a repair center, and the cost of repair is same as the camera itself now, I won't get it fixed or buy any other Fuji product again. This is a common problem that they had with their design in this particular model and they should fix it with no cost at me. If a car has such a common problem, they recall it and fix the problem for you with no cost but for cameras you pay 400 dollars (it is some money, maybe not same as cars but why do we measure respect with money) and they don't respect their customers, then ok, they won't have loyal customers either.

Let me jump right into the pros and cons and I'll try to explain a little about them afterwards.PROS:Feels good in your hands and not very heavy.Plenty of manual features to get lost in.Large enough LCD screen to see what you need before and after the shot.Buttons placed for easy reach.Cost.Good battery life.CONS:Very, very bad low light images.No manual focus option.Even at 3.2 mega pixels the shots are still grainy.Red reduction often ADDS red eye.No interchangeable lenses.Limited video sizes and bad audio.Very slow shutter lag.After a few years of owning this camera I really want to replace it. About 2/3 of my shots are taken indoors and this camera is useless inside unless the room is lit like a Hollywood set. The camera will not focus at any distance in normal indoor lighting. On the auto setting, inside shots always come out grainy. The flash is simply to weak to help. Since there is no way to manually focus the pictures you are constantly crossing your fingers hoping that the shot will come out somewhat decent so you can later fix the image on the computer.The software that came with the camera does not have a red eye option to fix the red eye this camera is famous for giving your subjects. When you try to use the red eye reduction flash it always and I repeat always gives your subject red eye and always makes it worse had you left it off.There is what looks like a screw on lens on the camera (not shown in product image) so you think you will have the ability to add a different lens. It is actually there to hold a filter. Since this camera is not a popular model FujiFilm has not made any filters (maybe 2) for you to use so its really just misleading.The video sizes are 160 x 120 and 320 x 240. Which are ok for thumb nails but not something you are really able to watch. Since the camera is grainy at low light (meaning anything shot indoors) and the flash is only for pictures, your videos will be small, grainy, out of focus, and do nothing but fill up your memory card. The audio for the video is also useless unless you have bionic ears and can make out the mummbles.The shutter lag is awful. No matter what trick you try you will always miss an action shot. There is a Sport mode on the camera but I'm not sure what it does since it does not help with focus, shutter lag, lighting, etc.On the good side, it's a cheap camera but you get what you pay for with it.I'll keep using it until I can afford a better DSLR camera but you can bet once my new camera shows up this one will be given to my teenage son to abuse.","Date":"February 15, 2008"}

This thing takes the picture at least a second or two after you press the button.  You also have to wait a couple of seconds before you can take another.  If you want to take a picture quickly or something not posed and the target is holding absolutly still, then this is not the camera for you.Since the shutter speed is so low, you have to hold it absolutly still.

Sometimes, we have to turn it on and off repeatedly before it \"takes\" and turns on, then it will turn off again just as suddenly.

{"Title":"Great camera...lousy service by Kodak","Author":"Paul R. Trufant \"trufant\"","ReviewID":"R2BPX6WOGGB35F","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had this camera for 12 months and 3 weeks.  It (of course) has a 12-month warranty.  2 weeks out of warranty and it dies.  While this has been an excellent camera while functioning, it is particularly frustrating when an electronic item fails moments after its warranty period.  Kodak will not budge.  Other electronics companies that I've dealt with in the past have stepped up and responsibly honored their warranty slightly beyond norm in appreciation for customer loyalty.  So far, no luck with Kodak.  After talking to a service center, I've found that the repair is likely to cost me about $200.  Important note; the camera was never dropped or exposed to moisture. This is simply a mechanical failure.While this camera was great while it worked, my experience has me doubting that I will replace it with another Kodak.","Date":"March 14, 2003"}

Its dirt cheap and beats all its competition in price.2. Has 3X optical zoom.3. Uses inexpensive & easy to find NiMH AA batteries.4. Light weight.5. Downloading pics on Win XP is very easy, you don't need to buy any AC adaptor or card reader. Included cable works great.6. The manual is easy to read and understand.7. The menus on the camera itself are very easy to use and navigate.8. Nice, sharp & well focused daytime pics.Here are some negatives,1. Too thick to put in any pocket, except maybe a big winter coat.2. Uses a propreitary and expensive xD card. This adds to cost and makes tougher to recommend it.3. Lens has very slow startup time and takes long to retract back. I feel its slower than even 2600.4. Poor low light performance.5. Mostly the white balance/ brightness is wrong, have to fiz each picture in Photoshop.6. There's no TV output on this, what a shame !7. The movies recorded don't have sound and are not so great8. Cheap and low resolution LCD screen.9. Fuji cut too many features compared to 2600 on this, smaller LCd size, no NiMH battery/charges included, slow startup times etc.10. Poor build quality. Last yr's 2600 failed due to many things like stuck lens and battery leaked charge. 2650 seems likely to have same troubles.Wish Fuji had made this thinner by about 0.7\", used a standard Compact Flash card instead of propreitary xD card, had a TV out, better white balance and quality control. My 2650 is going back to store. I had rather buy a Canon or Nikon.If you don't mind being stuck with a dead camera on a trip and don't mind above shortcomings its a good buy. Overall if you on a tight budget or a first time buyer you can go for this. Otherwise look for something worth your time and money.","Date":"November 27, 2002"}
{"Title":"poor in low light poor software good lens cheap","Author":"Max Rockbin","ReviewID":"RHZ3WAMXK2TUP","Overall":"bad","Content":"Good things about this camera:1. CHEAP2. very lightweight (though not particularly small)3. Nice quality lensBad Things:1. In even moderately low light (like a room with windows on a nice day) the camera still needs the flash.  Without it, the pictures come off blury and off color (even with white balance adjusted).  Expect to take ALL indoor pics with a flash -- ditto for outdoor at dusk.2.  Very little in the way of manual settings. If you switch to \"manual\" you can choose from some preset whitebal adjustments (e.g. incondescent, flourescent) and make some minor adjustments to whatever the camera judges is the best exposure.  BUT none of these settings is available if you want to use the self timer.3. MEMORY IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  This camera uses Fuji (and Olympus) new \"XD\" memory.  It's smaller and not particularly fast.  It also costs three times what regular digital camera memory (FLASH) costs.  So tack that [X]  premium back on the price.I got an amazing price on the camera with coupons and such, but I'm still returning mine because sometimes I'd like to be able to take a good picture without that flash look. (You can manually disable the flash, but the pics just don't look good without it).","Date":"November 16, 2002"}
{"Title":"Disappointing in every way","Author":"R. Rodel","ReviewID":"R1KL1RODISDBMU","Overall":"bad","Content":"I am sorry to say this but the Fuji 2650 is a very poor camera. It should be recalled and taken off the market. 1. The 2650 is only good for outdoor daylight posed shots or indoor posed shots within 8 feet due to a feeble flash and poor low light picture taking ability.2. The time delay between pushing the button and the shutter snap is so unacceptably slow that you will always miss the candid shot.3. The fixed ISO is set to ISO 100 which is too slow to stop any action.4. Forget about any low light picture taking.I have seen other digital cameras take clear night photos. There is no hope of doing that with this toy.5. The auto-focus seemed to work better when the camera was new but now it seems to have gotten slow and unpredictable and seems to frequently focus on things other than what is in the Autofocus frame.6. When taking consecutive pictures of the same subject in Auto mode, the shutter speeds inexplicably vary between 1/140 and 1/450 sec.  causing various degrees of blurriness .7. Red Eye reduction and all the other special settings do nothing. All these special features may sound cute but in reality are just nonfunctional gimmicks. It would be nice if Fuji would get serious and dispense with all this silly nonsense and just build in a faster ISO or variable ISO speed.8. The worst thing is that the logic chip has gone haywire causing the LCD display to be scrambled and unusable. Others have had this same problem and have stated Fuji can't seem to fix it.9. Video mode has no sound. You will immediately wish it did.Anyone who thinks this is a \"great\" camera and gives it 4 or 5 stars in these user reviews either has very low standards or is just plain ignorant. This is such a disappointing camera I am not even going to spend the money to try to get it fixed. According to other reviews it may come back from Fuji still broken... or fixed temporarily and only work for a short time before the LCD problem reoccurs.Do yourself a favor. Get a Canon or an Olympus with 100, 200, and 400 ISO speeds built in. It's important.","Date":"May 21, 2004"}

I like to talk about the bad before I start with the good since most people only read the first 3 lines or a review.  The Bad:  After only using this camera after 3 1/2 weeks, the back LCD went black/white. No picture.  Kind of a problem here.  I chatted with FujiFilm, and it is a recognized Camera problem.  Sent it back, received it back 2 weeks later, and the camera is still broken.  Not good. Can have warranty for years, but if they cant fix it, bummer.The Good:  It takes excellent pictures and the compression on Fuji cameras are one of a kind. Meaning, you can usually take more pictures.  The built of the camera (other then the LCD) is really tough, even though I tested this (went rock climbing) after I received my camera back and it was still broken.Extra Notes:  The lens, when shutter is open, takes about 3-4 seconds to fully extend when power is on. Something the manual doesn't say.Now, I have bought another camera, but I keep the Fuji as a outdoor camera (rock climbing and sorts) since the LCD back screen is broken, and sounds like Fuji doesn't have a fix... yet. Other then that, Fuji usually brings out excellent cameras, just this one product isn't well made or there engineers missed something. Don't know. But other then that, I gave it 2 stars because it (the camera) still is useful to me at this time. Hope this helps some people out there.","Date":"November 30, 2003"}

I called FujiFilm customer service, and after sitting on hold for 30 minutes, I got a technician who told me that he'd never heard of anyone having this problem, and since the warranty was up, to take it to a local authorized service company. I called that company, they said it would not be worth it to have it fixed.  Now, after having read all these reviews, I know this is a fairly common problem.  So the guy at Fujifilm lied to me!!  I am ticked, and because of this experience I will never buy another Fujifilm product.  Too bad, because the pic quality was superb, but Fujifilm obviously doesn't stand behind their products.

{"Title":"Fuji Buji Duji Wuji Kuji Ouji Luji","Author":"rattan","ReviewID":"R1JFOO3JXFR84T","Overall":"bad","Content":"This camera has a good price. However for anyone with any desire to tweak settings you should definitely not get this. Other 2MP camera's such as Canon A40 have lots of creative options not found here, including adjustable ISO speed. This will add visible noise above 100, but it is possible to get low light shots not thinkable with this camera. Also the maximum . 1/2 sec. shutter interval does not help in this respect. As someone mentioned, the white balance tends to be off a bit. Here are some additional ideas of mine relating to this product and the fact that it only uses xD memory(which by the way, as of this, costs twice the price of CompactFlash or Smartmedia and by the time you buy a good amount of memory you will have spent as much as a better canon or something with the same amount of memory): I could not agree more on the issue brought up here. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus (w/Memstick). Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good..","Date":"December 27, 2002"}

One day I decided to look for a cheap point and shoot camera for myself and the FinePix 2650 caught my eye because of the features that it comes with:  small size, optical zoom, glass lens, movie mode lower price, comparing with a previous SmartMedia version FinePix 2600 and surprising - ability to use that camera (as all the rest of Fuji cameras) as a webcam for video conferencing. I checked reviews online on CNET and Amazon.com - it had very nice user comments. So I decided to give it a test. After I took several pictures (which I do every day with other cameras) there was no question left - this camera can't focus. First after the camera identifies the object it remembers its location, puts itself in a sleep mode for about a second or two (which is a lot) so it can actually establish the focus, and after the focus has been established it actually snaps the picture. And as a result - during those one-two seconds being in a sleep mode either your hand can move just a little bit, the object itself can move, or anything else around the object (like a car on a background, or a pedestrian somewhere on a side) which causes the camera to loose it's focus immediately.  That's exactly what happened in about 28 pictures out of 30 total.","Date":"February 14, 2003"}

After reading reviews I upgraded to the C-5050 (worst mistake ever). The pictures were out of focus most of the time and with noticible noise.  I adjusted everything from AF spot to Sharpness, but seemed to get the same results.  Comparing my old pictures from C-3040 to C-5050 I am very dissapointed.  I returned it back to the store and waiting to either go with the Sony DSC-F717 or upgrade to the New Canon Rebel digital which is due mid-sept.  I wish I never sold my original C-3040. But I will try out all cameras before buying to see how the crisp the photos come out when I upload them to my laptop.","Date":"August 26, 2003"}

If I power on/off, it goes away for a few pictures.  I tried this just yesterday (31 Oct 2006) on 'low batteries', ended up taking 118 pictures with it.  Most were without flash, and did not use LCD viewfinder.Used a C-2100 Ultra Zoom for over a year in 2000-2001 which I why I picked Olympus.  2 other family members purchased Olympus on my recommendation.  I hope those models turn out better than the C5050 and Olympus support is better and more reasonable.For the expense of servicing, I'm just riding out this camera until it stops working.  Will then put money towards a newer/better/cheaper model.  Other family members have Kodak Easy-Share models, have not heard problems with them.

Two years of very light usage, and it's already broken.  I sent it to the Olympus Service Center. They replied with an estimate for $197.96 but no mention of what was wrong with the camera. (The $197.96, incidentally, only buys me six more months of warrranty.)  A call to their \"service representative\" yielded no further information.  I was told that their was no one I could speak to who could tell me what was wrong with the camera.  They did know, however, that it wasn't the bad CCD issue (a covered repair) because my serial number wasn't in the batch of cameras that had that problem.I was given the option of paying $197.96 for a camera that would then be guaranteed to work only six more months or trading in for a cheaper camera for $240.  The cheaper camera is an Olympus SP310 which Amazon sells for $243.  Some trade-in, huh?Not surprisingly the C-5050 has been discontinued but don't be another Olympus victim.

This is the second Sony digital still camera that I've owned and I've used a few more.  The other (2.1MPixel) unit that I had before suffered from the same crappy focussing system. The earlier Sonys that I've used were much better.Some pictures come out beautifullly sharp, and others are not well-focussed. The thing that really bothers me is that I know that it's not me, since I'm a very experienced SLR photographer and have very good success with almost all the other camera gear that I've used. And that it's not predictable... there is no one thing that I can nail down to being the cause. I can use a tripod, or go hand-held and it doesn't make much difference. Good things about this camera are the user-interface. Sony really has a great system that is quick to use, simple to understand and effective. This camera is also loaded with an excellent battery system, lots of manual and automatic features. It's really just one step below a true SLR in many ways. That's it...

We purchased this camera when our daughter was born due to its size, functions, manual setting features and 5mp res.  At first, being a gear head, I thought I didn't understand the features/functions thoroughly enough.  SO I read the paper manual, AND the manual on CD (imagine, as a mom with a newborn!)  Now after 8 months of disappointing shots, albeit the occassional hero shot, I still want to throw it out the window.WHY?1.  ON/OFF:  to turn the camera on you have to slide the lens cover open and wait about 4 seconds (forever) for the lens to extend. The lens will retract and you have to start all over again even if you slightly touch it - which is very easy to do.  Bad design.  Reviewing captured images is another test of patience.2. RED EYE:  of the hundreds of shots we've taken indoors with this camera, 75% have redeye.  You can use the redeye reduction feature (nice) but realize it is \"red eye REDUCTION\".  SUre you can remove it with software, but consider the enormous amt of wasted time.  Why did the lens capture it in the first place?3. SPEED:  the slowness of the open AND close, the redeye flash and the battery charge.  The amt of blurry shots is staggering.I'm esp. frustrated b/c our baby is now 8 mths old, and numerous once-in-a-lifetime shots have been missed.WE LIKE: the remote control, the sturdiness, the size.","Date":"October 6, 2003"}

However after 9 months photos taken with this camera produced a white line that ran vertically in the middle of each picture.  Olympus support agreed to fix it under  the 1 year warranty.  However as this camera belonged to my company I had it professionally packed and sent via DHL to Olympus's repair depot in California. A month later Olympus sent me a terse note stating that the camera had \"UPPER CORNERS DENTED. WARRANTY INVALID DUE TO IMPACT DAMAGE\".  They demanded $150 to fix it \"out of warranty\". The fact that I oversaw the packaging myself and saw not a scratch makes me suspect that either DHL or Olympus employees damaged it in transit and both company disavowed any responsibility. Though I personally use an Olympus still camera for the last 10 years and have had good experiences with it, I must say that the current level of quality/control and warranty support leads me to believe that quality has dropped considerably on Olympus products in the last few years.

I have been an Olympus fan since buying my first OM1 SLR in the 70's. Despite some negative reviews in this forum, I bought this camera thinking that it would rise above the negative comments that are made for almost every product reviewed. It has turned out to be the most extremely disappointing camera I've bought. I have read the instructions in the manual and referred to the CD. I made a reasonable effort to learn the camera. To my frustration, I have found that even taking a simple snapshot from a few feet away is problematic. Exposures are erratic, most are blurred, and I can't count on what's going to be recorded. I sure hope that Olympus gets their act together on this or I will never buy a product from them in the future.

But yet again I had the same problem.Don't get me wrong, when there's no redeye the pictures can be stunning and very sharp but having to get rid of redeye in photoshop on every picture wasn't an option.I gave up, took it back and got the Canon sureshot s-50. What a difference. Get redeye only about 10 percent of the time and the quality is excellent.

I even asked them if someone had reported this problem previously and, of course, they had never heard of it, which I now seriously doubt. This is why I am re-rating this equipment now with 2 stars, one for every year she worked properly.As I said in my previous review, be aware of the procrastinating mode this camera kicks into when taking quick shots under low light situations (you might never take the shot) and now with the spooky white fog special effect that appears in every picture after two years of use.So, bottom line...

I never dropped it, it never got wet, always stayed in a dry warm place. No one else handled it. All of a sudden when I was taking pictures it took a long time to get the picture every time and it started having horizontal lines running across the screen without allowing to see anything. Today the camera failed to see an image completely. Some horizontal \"ghost\" and lines that move across the viewer  screen and the screen is completely dark, although the charge minutes remaining indicator is appearing and I can view my taken pictures as well, but when I put it on \"take photo\" mode, the screen is black with sometimes lines running through it. How do I describe the problem otherwise? It is like if the camera has lost vision completely. It works, charges, takes pictures, but it can not see, the pictures come out either totally dark without any image or with some violet ghost light and no image whatsoever. When I point the camera to an object, the screen is dark or dark with horizontal running lines or some violet coloured ghost moving across the screen. Of course, I made sure I removed the cap and etc. I also did RESET and changed the battery, but no help. June 2007 UPDATE: it appeared to be a failure with all or most SONY cameras, just like a pre-programmed timed failure. There was a class action against SONY and they set up a recall program and I shipped my camera to them (SONY paid the shipping both ways as a part of the recall program) and they fixed it and sent it back to me.

The camera was great in the beginning. My wife loved taking pictures under full automatic mode and I loved the ability to change shutter exposure, ISO speed, and other 'semi-pro' features. The picture quality was excellent. Some people do not like how large the camera is but I far prefer having all features with their own button rather than the menus many other cameras have. When it is dark it is far easier to feel for a button than traverse a menu.After a little over a week I noticed that the pictures were becoming more and more pixelated. At first I thought I must have pushed the manual controls too far because it happened most often on pictures that were out of focus but then I noticed it happening on all pictures. It eventually became so bad within a few days that I could not take pictures with it any more.I contacted Sony service and they had me send the camera back to them. They sent it back not only with the problem unfixed, but with the viewfinder now broken.  My wife called in tears that we would not have the camera for the birth of our son and they promised to rectify it immediately, promising us a UPS tag to send it back to them within the next day or two. It took a week and a half to get to us.

It was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid.The two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing.I've had no problem with Canon whatsoever. With Nikon, althoughpicture qualities are as good as any other 4 MP cameras, I've had the following headaches;1. Pictures won't transfer to PC directly from the camera using the included transfer cable. I did everything I could, and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to PC is with the card reader. Card reader is included.2. The speed is noticeably slower than Canon, especially so with flashes on.3. With low battery, it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip. I used Lexar 256 MB and I still use it which means nothing is wrong with Lexar.  Be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries.","Date":"October 3, 2003"}
{"Title":"worst experience with Nikon 4300","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2T6QN3EUK0F84","Overall":"bad","Content":"Buyers be aware. I purchased this Nikon 4300 based on online reviews. This is the worst purchase I ever made. The camera is poorly designed. Besides minor irritations like the lens cap and battery recharge, the camera's other major operating functins are not even up to the standard of normal use. I used a 256MB Compact flash card. After taking dozens of pictures, it became painfully slow (longer than 5 sec) to write the data into memory card. You will for sure miss many great photo opportunities. The worst is when you need to delete any pictures. After many shots, each deletion will take over 10 minutes to complete (no typo here). Are you kidding me, Nikon people? I can't believe Nikon is even selling this product. You may wonder maybe this is a rare case of defect, but no, this is already the second replacement from factory. Both cameras are having the same problems. The camera must have used a very outdated processor and is extremely slow. When you need to review the photos in the camera, you can feel how slow the pictures are displayed. The irritations are just too much to bear. Now I am really skeptical at what I read online. Most are marketing ploy, not to be trusted.","Date":"October 30, 2003"}

Crockett","ReviewID":"RWCGUWUKWPPC0","Overall":"bad","Content":"The Coolpix functioned well until about 10 months into ownership, when the lens mechanism failed and the display shows only a \"System Error\" message.  I suspect that because the unit designs to force the lens against the lens cap, some damage occurs through frequent use if you fail to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on.  This is a definite design defect.  Although I loved the camera for 10 months, and frequently used it instead of my Canon EOS 10D, this design defect basically sinks this unit as defective from the get-go.  Avoid.However, in this edit of my review, I was able to fix the problem later by continuing to cycle the camera through a lens opening and closing and by forcing the retraction of the lense.  (I know it is hard to explain.)  Finally, the software matched the machinery and the system error vanished.  What a hassle, but it saved sending the camera back.","Date":"December 13, 2003"}

The problem is that the camera displays a message \"please remove lens cap\" even though the lens cap has been removed.  This is an intermittent problem which sometimes prevents me from taking pictures.  Annoying.I have no idea how common this problem is and am prepared to give Nikon the benefit of the doubt that this is unusual and should not be taken as indicative of the quality of their digital cameras as a whole, however I do have a problem with the quality of service offered, which is certainly more broadly applicable.The product is under warranty so I sent this back to be repaired.  Nikon would not cover the cost of shipping, although I asked them to do so.  The camera was serviced and returned (2 weeks later), however the problem persisted.  I requested that Nikon send me a new unit since they had failed to fix the problem and I did not have time to send it to them for another two weeks before I visited family for Christmas.  Their service policy prevented them from doing this, but since it was a return service they would pay for shipping this time around.  No good to me.The implication is that they take ownership of the problem if they fail to fix it with the first visit, however I would suggest that they ought to take full ownership of the faulty product from the start.  They tell me that their policy is that they will consider replacing the product if I have to send it in for repair for the same problem a THIRD time.  (I think I will be shopping for Canon camera by that stage)They are one step behind where a company of their standing should be.  Sloppy.","Date":"December 10, 2003"}

It needs about 1-2 seconds from the moment I hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture, and I have had so much occasion with peoples, where this ruined the take. Specially with kids, you have a good moment and shoot, but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away. Also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow, there go other 10 good moments until the cam is ready again. Maybe the save file time can be shortened with a better highspeed flash card, the one I use is a standard card. But it will still be too much time to save the image.

He and his girlfriend was on his way to Latin America for a once in a lifetime extended vacation and wanted a really good camera to catch them memories of that trip. I then had my son calling me on the phone to be advised that the Nikon Coolpix had packed up halfway through his trip, and worse still also finding out that the camera did not have any international warranty, despite that Nikon is a large and international company.I phoned Nikon to confirm the problems and decided to purchase him another Nikon Coolpix and send it to him and sort out the malfunctioning camera upon return. So upon his return to the Nikon camera was sent to Nikon Service Centre under warranty, only to be told that the camera had APPARENTLY suffered with humidity or water damage and was now uneconomic to repair. Quoting extracts from Nikon here they said: \"Advised customer that repair has liquid damage.\" The water has caused the components to corrode, evident by the white fungus/mould. Called customer and offered exchange of a 4300 at 328 inc VAT\"Being offered a replacement Nikon camera, but at a cost that turned out to be no kind favour at all, since it was far in excess of buying a new camera from a regular camera shop who sell the same item at a lot less, like 79 difference, no warranty cover for water or humidity damage according to Nikon, so not really much help there then!Quote Brand NIKONProduct Name COOLPIX 4300Jessops Code  NIKC4300Jessops Price  249.90  The battery life on the Nikon Coolpix camera's that I have experienced, in some cases only giving 20 to 30 pictures, does not seem good and does not get better, it gets worse if anything as the batteries seem to fade away! I have now returned 3 Nikon Coolpix camera's to my local dealer and now intend to return two more soon also for credit against other more reliable camera's from another camera company that has not forgotten how to look after its customers?I my family and friends, on my recommendations, have now all switched to Canon Camera's. We have already purchased so far Three PowerShot Camera's a G2 and G3 both 4 Million Pixel camera's at very good prices (since both are now obsolete models), also a lovely newer current model the Canon Powershot G5 which is now increased to a very useful 5 Million Pixels. The design facilities, the quality and ease of use of all of these Canon PowerShot camera's seems to be much excellent, especially the newer CanonPowershot G5. The battery life is on CanonPowershot G5 is on another planet, by excellent by comparison to Nikon Coolpix camera that I have experienced! CanonPowerShot camera's are now on a regular basis taking over 500 pictures, some with the flash and that includes looking at them lots also on the screen often in disbelief at the high quality! The quality of photographs under all conditions has proven to be excellent. The movie sequences are also an amazing feature. The CanonPowershot cameras are slightly larger, than the but that makes it easier not to drop from my experience, which is what I would do with Nikon Coolpix camera's after my bad experiences!My next purchases of expensive professional digital camera kits will likely also be Canon EOS range camera's also, perhaps not surprisingly!","Date":"February 6, 2004"}

I bought this camera back in July 2003 for $350 from Beach Camera. Alot of major annoyances with this camera such as the lens cap- you have to remember to take it off before you turn the camera on or else you get a message saying to take the cap off and restart the camera. The menu is tedious and cumbersome to work with. The manual settings take too much time. The start up time lags. Time between shots lag especially using flash. It can take up to 16 seconds between shots using flash. (You will definately lose alot of good potential shots using this camera). Its only a 4 megapixel camera. That might have been good in 2003 but in 2009- its time to buy a new camera. Does not have image stabilization.(IS is a must in 2009).The camera is pretty noisy while focusing. Battery usage is very low as is expected with all PS cameras. The included software is pretty much useless in 2009. Picture quality is pretty good which is one of this cameras highlights. So in conclusion- if you are on a shoe string budget then this is the camera you are going to get. I would not pay more than $70 used as this camera is over 6 years old in 2009. Dont expect any keeper shots if you need fast recycling time between shots. This camera was state of the art 6 years ago. Not anymore.","Date":"February 14, 2009"}

I currently own an Olympus D-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures.  However, indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy.  Anyway, in the store, I tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4MP models (Minolta Dimage S414, and Panasonic Lumix).  Focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time, pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange. Pictures produced by the Minolta were orange but not blurry.  Pictures produced by the Panasonic were excellent.  The store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when I press the button, which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models.  Anyway, I ended up purchasing the Lumix.  I'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about.

However, while I was stationed in Iraq the camera suffered from an E24 error while it was with my wife in Germany. I chose not to take the camera to Iraq out of fear that it would be damaged. Instead, to my suprise, it was damaged in Germany for no apparant reason, atleast not one due to poor handling. My wife mailed the camera to the Canon repair shop in the States. They returned the camera in working order. The repairs were completed free of charge since it was in the time period of the one year warranty. On the day I returend from Iraq (6 months later after the first repair) a friend took a photo of us at the reception ceremony. The camera relapsed into the same state as before - an E24 error. The LCD screen would not display any data. The camera therefore completely shut itself off, a feature that was later explained to me by a Canon representative that is used to protect the camera from further damage. I spoke with a repair representative about what appears to me to be an easy fix. I was told that since my warranty had expired I would have to pay a minimum of $187 to a maximum of $500 for the repairs. Keep in mind this was told to me prior to any Canon technician ever even looked at the camera. I asked if that would still be the charge if it was a fix as simple as a loose screw and they told me that was an accurate assumption. I then asked if I would be required to pay if it was found that the problem was related to the initial repair having not been done properly while under warranty, again they responded that I would. They then informed me of an \"Upgrade Program\". They told me I could send them my G3, and pay them an additional $300, and in return I would receive a REFURBISHED G5! Not a new one, REFURBISHED! If I were to accept that offer I would end up paying $950 for a refurbished Canon G5 ($300 + the original $650 for the G3). I was insulted to say the least. I'm willing to bet that those refurbished G5's are part of a program that they have for an upgrade to the G6 for the G5 users that have the same issue as I. What a scam! What a pathetic customer service department! What an insult to an American soldier that just returned from a 13 month deployment in Iraq! Oh yeah, the company is Japanese, they don't care anyway;)But by the way, I do own another Canon Powershot A20, 2.1 MP. I've owned it for over 3 years and it has been a great camera.

I have a card reader, so the camera itself has never been connected to my computer.I emailed a friend who also has an S45, and he said he has no explanation for the failure of my S45, and he has none for the failure of HIS.  (Though he gloats that he used his longer than I used mine!)  I am sad that my $450-plus camera served me for only five months.  If you have any suggestions for me, I would appreciate it.","Date":"December 30, 2003"}

{"Title":"Sorry, but Sony is better","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RNPVKY1T8NPJ2","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had a Sony P-7 from earlier this year. Bought this Olympus for my sister. She liked that it was smaller, had a solid feel and weather-resistant buttons. Also, the guy at BBuy said \"Olympus makes cameras. Sony makes camcorders.\"I did a side-by-side comparison, taking pictures of the exact same scenes, day and night, near and far. Sony is far superior. In low light situations, the Sony AF Illuminator shoots a red light towards the subject so the AF can lock onto it. Perfect pictures. Olympus, on the other hand, cannot \"lock\" onto the subject, and you always end up with blurred subjects. Another bad result - since it cannot determine how far the subject is from the camera, it floods everything with the flash. So aside from blurred, the subject is whited-out.In daylight, the Sony also was superior. Colors were deeper, and edges were clean. I took a picture of an orchid, and with the Olympus, the outline of the petal was jagged. I tried this with different resolution settings on both cameras, from 1Meg to 3.2Meg, and Sony was still better.I ended up returning the Olympus to BB and ate the 15% re-stocking fee. Bought the Sony P-8 instead.","Date":"August 9, 2003"}

Unfortunately with children, we do not always have the opportunity to adjust the lighting to get a great picture. When this happens, the pics ALWAYS turn out grainy or blurry (and the flaw isn't noticable on the LCD screen. Only after you download or print is when you see it). It really is disappointing because we have taken many pictures that would have turned out great if not for this problem. My parents have a Canon Powershot (not positive on the model) and they never have this problem--always beautiful pictures. I would definitely suggest that anyone in the market for a digital camera look at a different brand, or at least a more recent model.","Date":"October 17, 2005"}
{"Title":"Olympus let me down.","Author":"Mark Perez","ReviewID":"R8LI2MQVFJV3Y","Overall":"bad","Content":"My first digital camera was an Olympus c3000. I was so impressed with the photo quality from that camera that I decided to stay with Olympus when I moved to a more compact camera. I loved my C3000 but I found I was leaving it at home because of its size.The Olympus name and the compact size of the Stylus 300 was what initially attracted me to it. The promise of being \"weatherproof\" sold me. I have to admit, although heavy, the size was perfect. Not too big. Not too small. I carried it everywhere. However, that's where my love affair with the Stylus 300 ends. The autofocus was slow. Woefully slow. I found a majority of my photos were blurred. Yes, I know how to operate the autofocus. However, for most spontaneous shots, the autofocus lagged behind.I was willing to work around that because of its size and, again, the promise of being \"weatherproof.\" That promise was broken a couple of months ago. On our way to an outdoor concert, it began to rain. \"No problem!\" I confidently told my companions, \"I'll take my camera. It's weatherproof.\" It's not. Before leaving the car, I checked to make sure the port doors were closed properly and the camera looked as sealed as it should be. To be fair, the camera functioned for an hour or two just fine. I was able to snap a few pictures as the rains came down. But the next shot I attempted greeted me with flashing green lights. That's when I noticed the water. The viewfinder was half full of water! At this point, I shut the camera off and stowed it back in my rain gear.Back at home, I opened all the doors to the camera and placed it on the dresser for several days. I'd hoped that the damage was limited to the viewfinder and that, once dry, the camera would be ok. No such luck. It hasn't worked since. The camera is out of warranty or I'd send it to Olympus.Initially, I was mildly disappointed with the picture quality from this camera. Now, I feel cheated. For a brief second, I looked at the Stylus Verve because of its size and its claim of being \"weatherproof.\" I soon came to my senses. Olympus let me down and won't get a second chance.","Date":"November 19, 2004"}

It went everywhere with me, was compact and took what I thought were pretty good photos.  However, the slider began to loosen up after nine or ten months, just before the 12 month warranty period expired.  I checked around to get an estimate on 'tightening' the piece and found that minimally it would cost at least $100.As Olympus advertised a customer satisfaction trade in policy, I e-mailed them.  I waited a few days for an answer, and e-mailed again.  When I still didn't receive an answer, I phoned.  I did this a number of times as I couldn't seem to get around the voice mail system.  When I finally did get through to a human, the folks there didn't seem to know who I should speak to.  I was put through to voice mail again and left another message.  I did this three more times, and of course, never got a call back, and my warranty expired.I finally did get through and explained my story.  I was told that I could trade in the Olympus Stylus 300, which had cost me just under $300, however, the only trade in I would be allowed would be to a singular, more costly camera and that for another $350, Olympus would \"trade\" up and I could have that model.  When I said I thought that was ridiculous, I became subject to quite a tongue lashing, along with attitude from the Olympus rep.  When I told him I was not pleased,  and that any additional money I spent would go towards a different camera from a manufacturer other than Olympus, he became abusive.I am now shopping for replacement cameras, and have been to two stores, neither of which stock Olympus equipment.  When I asked why, I was told that Olympus' lack of customer service and failure to honor warranties were the reason.This is the first review I have ever written, and it's fair to point out that I was quite happy with my little Stylus for the first nine months, however, owing to the manufacturer's lack of concern, snarky reps and failure to honor printed guarantees, I can say that I will never again purchase anything Olympus.Buyer beware....","Date":"August 12, 2006"}
{"Title":"There must be a better camera","Author":"gjportland","ReviewID":"R14JSXQ1B8QFXF","Overall":"bad","Content":"I gave my Nikon digital to my daughter when I purchased the Olympus because I wanted a camera that was more 'weatherproof'.  We spend quite a bit of time at the beach and involve ourselves in some watersports (kayaking).  I did not feel comfortable with having the Nikon even near anything wet.  Upon examining the Olympus, I suspected that its 'weatherproofness' was pretty weak.  The hatch covers for the battery and usb port are quite flimsy and way too easy to open accidentally.  Although the covers do have 'o' ring type seals, it was obvious these will not hold back nominal splashing water.  Also, the lens slide is very vulnerable to sand -- so taking the slide off and cleaning the slide grooves has become routine. Mechanically, the camera just seems cheap --unlike the less expensive Nikon that feels solid.Using the camera is much more involved than the Nikon.  I didn't appreciate Nikon's menu setup/controls until I used the Olympus.  It drove me nuts  -- and still does.On the plus side, the pics seem fine.  And unlike other reviewers, I find the battery life is pretty good.  I do have a couple of back up batteries that are always charged, so no problem. The chip holds lots of pics.I have had many regular Olympus cameras in the past (all 35mm) and have always thought highly of Olympus quality.

I decided to buy this as my first digital camera because I had been impressed with the Olympus Stylus 80 film camera I have had for several years (and still do). The stylus digital takes reasonable pictures compared with other digital cameras my friends own, and the battery life is excellent. I invested in the 256MB memory card and still haven't found out how many pictures you can cram on it at normal quality, but it's a lot.I had complaints from the beginning however, about the space of time between my pressing the button and the actual taking of the shot. When you are trying to take pictures of children, the 1 or 1 1/2 second gap makes it nearly impossible to get the shot you were trying to get, and the good pictures I have gotten of my kids have been almost accidental. I was also disappointed to discover the limitations of the included software, which does not allow you to e-mail pictures unless you give Olympus another $20 for the privilege. Frankly, I thought this was a simple gouge, and I resented it.My worst disappointment however, came recently. The camera shut off because the battery was exhausted. However, when I put in the fresh battery I had (and later, the recharged battery I had been using) the camera appeared to have frozen up. The lens will not extend and the little orange and green lights next to the viewfinder flash simultaneously and the camera beeps, a signal which, according to the manual, means that the battery is dead. Well, it 'aint! I cannot get the camera to work and the warranty will not be honoured where I live. This is the only digital camera I have ever owned, and so I cannot make a comparison with any others as to durability, but for cripe's sake, I paid top dollar for this about eight months ago and have treated it with kid gloves.

Some photos I took of friends had a strange hue over them and were blurry to say the least.Another problem I ran into was that the battery life in the camera wore down extraordinarily quickly. If you use this camera with flash the battery will wear out after about 10 photos.In addition when taking a picture the camera would pause for about 5 seconds, the screen would turn black, show the picture I just took for less than a second, turn black again for a few seconds and would then show what I was aiming at.Let's just say I went back to using that old Sony camera I had...I still can't belive how disappointed I was by a camera that was made by one of the best companies in the buisiness.This camera is not one for anyone who wants a reliable camera for everyday use. This is nothing more then a cheap attempt at making a halfway good digital camera.

The camera takes okay pictures - I cannot really complain or boast - but there are two things that make this a camera to stay away from:FIRST, the Secure Digital memory never worked.  We bought a 64 Mb card when we purchased the camera, and the camera never recognized it.  Retruned it to Amazon and got another - also didn't work.  Returned it and bought a third brand at the local Staples - also didn't work.  Kodak tech support said we needed to download new firmware for the camera (which was a big pain in the 'dupa' to do, but we did it), tried the SD card - same results.  Basically, unless we ship it back we are stuck with a camera that can only take 15 pictures.SECOND problem - the engineer who developed the battery door should be shot.  It is extremely hard to close, and within a month ours had already broken after changing the battery only twice.

I will not buy another Kodak product.","Date":"June 19, 2007"}
{"Title":"Good pictures, weak body, weak software","Author":"Dan and Rachel","ReviewID":"R1B38P1ADF4LRL","Overall":"bad","Content":"The DX6340 does take excellent pictures. As with most digital cameras there is an annoying delay between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture \"event\", but unless you spend a lot more money, it's something you live with when you go digital.  Plenty of options for the price.  Again, no qualms with the photo quality.The body of the camera, however, is not reliable.  The automatic lens \"door\" that opens when you turn on the camera frequently gets stuck and the battery door broke after a year and a half.  To replace that part you'd have to replace the entire body of the camera.  This also happened to a family member who has a Kodak.  If this happens, buy silver duct tape...at least it matches the camera color.The software is very touchy and locks up frequently and will sometimes require an entire PC reboot.I would not buy Kodak Easyshare again unless those three problems are resolved.","Date":"October 30, 2006"}

I put 'Amaryllis' in the gallery. Around 6-10 feet distance is safest. Cloud pictures: not bad.Cons: First of all, the pictures - sometimes you can't tell if they're actually going to be in focus, and the red warning light doesn't always act logically from one moment to the next.Second - the body: battery door is hanging by a thread.Third - there's a little click-wheel to turn it on and choose your \"mode\". I don't know who is dainty enough not to feel clumsy using this delicate little thing, and it often clicks past the slot you wanted to stop at, if you go too fast. No other way to do off-on, to use for USB transfers, or picture review.The body has always reminded me of the light snap-off grey plastic material for making toy model battleships, (from the 50's, maybe later too).I've not written a review before, but tonight I had to - I was dismayed to see that the screw-on tripod attachment was holding the battery in.

{"Title":"Buy Something Else","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R2KSG68O9M3UN9","Overall":"bad","Content":"I have done quite a bit of research on a variety of digital cameras in all price ranges. After reading the reviews, I thought that this would be the one for me. This was going to be the camera to capture those precious moments of my daughters wedding. Well I was wrong. It seemed like a easy camera to use. Even when you reviewed the pictures on the camera, they seemed fine. After that it went down hill. The pictures turned out to be blurry. Terrible camera to take any inside picture, and yes for all you supposed experts all the settings on the camera were tried. It just didn't matter. The only good inside of night time pictures were those taken about two feet away from the object you were taking the picture of. Trouble with the quality of the pictures was just the beginning. Numerous times the lenses aperture would not open or close on its own. If you are trying to save your batteries, you will not realize this until your picture comes up for review. Next was the fun time trying to download the pictures to our computer. First the share dock would not work. Then tried to hook the camera up directly to the computer, it didn't work either. Once again for all you experts it was not the computer. The next step was to call tech support. After over an hour of troubleshooting, no luck. The best they could tell me then was to try it on another computer, which I am sure that every household has 3 or 4 of. Well we do have two and that didn't work either. So there wasn't nothing easy about the easy share dock. The next day I went out and purchased a multi-slot card reader. It hooked right up and I was finally able to download all 180 of the pictures. Out of that 180 maybe 30 are worth keeping (and 20 of them were taken during the daytime). I just wanted to make sure that someone told the ugly side of the story about this camera. No more Kodak camera's for me.","Date":"January 17, 2004"}

But as time went by, I have found that actually taking pictures with this camera hasn't been easy.  Its been in for repairs two times - and had two CPU's and circuit boards replaced.  Its heading in for its third repair this week.  Within days of it arriving home from the repair shop, it has stopped working again.  Its incredibly infuriating because I've lost holiday and birthday photos which I can't replace.  They look great on the LCD, but after they're downloaded its evident that the photos are horribly distorted.  Alternatively, the camera stops allowing me to download pictures entirely. Its a shame since I've had great success with Kodak products in the past.  Recommendation - avoid this camera like the plague.","Date":"March 28, 2005"}

What really made me mad was the fact that the battery door cracked about 3 months into ownership. I took very good care of this camera that I spent $300 on. The door design is absolutely horrible, you have to work against the batteries to shut the door. Now 7 months later, the batteries keep dying after only a few pictures, sometimes the camera doesn't feel like turning on at all and other times it will work fine. Kodak says the battery door is not covered but they could fix for me for $175!!! The nerve! Absolutely avoid this POS especially at this price range.

Kodak forces you into using their software as it's the only way to get the pictures out of the camera unless you use a drive for your SD card.  Once inside the software, you can't rename picture files or save them to another folder.  Neither can you select a group of pictures and copy or drag and drop them to another program.  You can't even see the name of the picture file unless go to properties and then parse it out of an unfriendly name.  The software was made to lock you into using ofoto to share/print your pictures.  This software is extremely basic and suitable only for the beginning digital photo user or someone who only wants to print with the Kodak Camera dock.

{"Title":"What an awefull junk","Author":"Mark Twain \"S-L\"","ReviewID":"R2XV8TTPHCE469","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this camera wishing to move with digital age. I am a film camera user for the last 5 years and this one is my first digital camera in last two years.As usual Amazon did a great job in shipping my order in a timely manner, before the expeted delivery date. Thanks amazon.The camera itself was the surprise. I bought it after spending hours reading and searching for the best value/performance data in several forums and decided to go for it. So I am going to tell you what I liked most,Pros:- Good construction, made of alluminium. Picture quality is quite good (not that great as lot of reviewers mentioned here). My old Olympus C-211 2.1mpx took much better photos at ISO 100 than this one.4x zoom with 4 megapixel sensor, video recording with sound, manual focussing and lots of controls (most of them are useless at the end, I will talk about them later) and use of cheap CF card makes it a very attractive camera for film converts. Additionally I purchased a nice leather (fake) case for the camera as a lot users reported that the camera gets \"Turned On\" by itself while seating inside a pocket. The camera is relatively big, so I feel much easier to handhold it, always good for film converts. I never expected some of the surprising features like spot metering, live histogram and tiff file shooting in such an inexpensive camera.CONS:- Everything aside what I mentioned above. Picture quality, I don't know how good it is compared to others, but to me simply acceptable when comapre photos from my 3 year old C-211. Noise is much better controlled than my old camera though, but ISO 400 is equally unusable. I took most of my test shots at ISO 64 and 100.the real drawback of this camera is focussing. Even in normal daylight it miss autofocus like a moron. You will have no clue as you shoot. It will beep indicating autotofocus, looking at the LCD is a pure pain...all blurred image. Remember I am not a newbie and I know how to handhold a camera and mionimize shaking.Low light autofocus is even more pathetic....it's more like tossing a coin in the air.there is an option of manual focussing, but hey..I better use a 10 year old film camera if I have to use manual focussing for 50% of my shots.LCD screen is although quite big fo rthe price, is again not useful as it does not have any antiglare coating, so in outdoors you are pretty much stuck upon your luck.Video quality is nothing great..choppy at the best. Sound quality is also at best choppy.Another starange problem is heat build up. After 15 minutes of continuous use it becomes quite hot (not wram) around the battery compartment area. Should be good in midwest cold, huh!S414 is quite slow when it comes to write tiff files to the CF card and a better (I used a 80X lexar pro card) wont improve this fact. So DO NOT waste money on a faster card if you ever buy this camera (hope you will not do that). At the end I must mention the poor quality of power consumption. My 1800MAh batteries last for two card ( 128x2MB) loads of photos and I believe this is not at par with most of the recent cameras in the market.Supplied software is also just avarage..dont expect a lot out of it.So my conclusion:- Stay away if you can. Buy it if you have to go digital and you absolutely need a 4 MPX camera with 4x optical zoom.","Date":"October 4, 2004"}

The wide lense gives a nice straight picture.However...A set of AA alkalines lasts for only 5-10 flash photos.Using expensive lithium batteries allows the camera to consume all it wants and thus overheats to the point that touching the memory card burns you.  Laughably, the manual warns against touching the hot memory card after long continuous use!The battery door is plastic and becomes chewed up by the metal case.  Also, the zoom is easily damaged by switching on the camera accidentally when it's in a bag.I bought the Canon S50.

{"Title":"Very un-impressed","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R215OLAL3IN2SC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I was attracted to this camera because of the 4x optical zoom, and I have to admit, because it uses CompactFlash cards, of which I happened to have a supply, so it made the camera more economical right from the start.  I did some reading, perused reviews on various websites, and felt pretty confident with my decision.I spent two days really trying to like this camera.  But out of maybe 200 photos, I might have taken two that were keepers.  Problems -I think the worst problem I had was color accuracy.  Sunlit pictures had a funny yellow tint, a cloudy day produced truly cold colors.  When I used the White Balance settings to correct, the colors over-compensated.  Autofocus was less than spectacular.  In lower light, with or without flash, autofocus did not work correctly.  The manual focus is impossible to use effectively, because it only works in increments - you have to know what the exact distance is between the camera and the subject, then set it.  There are three settings for sharpness.  Even on the highest setting, I didn't get the same sharpness as I did from my almost 3-year-old 2-megapixel camera.  I have to admit, I did like the exposure preview on the LCD screen when I set apertures and shutter speeds in manual mode.  On-screen menus could have been more intuitive, and the *tiny* font/colors were not easy on the eyes.The battery door is clumsy and fragile (the demo model in the camera store broke when the store clerk tried to load batteries into it).The camera is easy to turn on when slipping it into a case, so batteries are wasted more easily.And did I mention its appetite for batteries?  This camera gobbles down AA's, 4 at a time!  Way worse than my previous digital.But the real test for any camera is image quality, and like I said, this was a total disappointment.  Poor color, focus, and sharpness add up to a loser in my book.  I returned the S414 and bought a less expensive 3-meg, 4X zoom camera, and I was happy with that one from the first picture I took.","Date":"January 17, 2004"}

When you carry this camera it is constantly turning on and off every time you bump it, or it brushes against your clothes.--It is slow to focus which makes it difficult to get any spontaneous or action pictures.--Its abilities are only the equavalent of 400 speed film. It is difficult to take any photos in low light situations. I have seen other digital cameras that are much better at this.--It takes 4 AA bateries, and goes through them very fast. I have the rechargeable ones that are recommended and even with those, I  can only use the camera for about 4 to 6 hours before I have to change them.

Most of the time I could not tell the shot was blurry, since it looked fine on the little screen.  However as soon as I got home and saw it on the computer I was immediately disappointed.  I went ahead and got them developed anyways, but ended up buying postcards on the trip to fill in for the bad pictures.  I did not try the manual focus option, so I do not know how that would have worked, but it seems like the night focus should have worked better than it did.

It's even thicker than the old Kodak, so I can't even fit it into the old carrying pouch I used for the old one.In addition, the camera strap isn't just a small wrist string, but a big, around-the-neck strap. More bulk.If you look at the product photo, you'll see a small dial on the top back edge of the camera. That's the on/off dial. Since it's on the edge, it's very easy to bump the dial into \"on\" position when you're putting the camera into a carrying case or a (very large) pocket. The battery door is also very flimsy, and I suspect the life of the battery door will determine the life of the camera. The lens cap doesn't pop off when the camera's turned on, so a new user (perhaps someone else at the party) is likely to pick it up, turn it on, look through the little view window, and snap a few photos of the inside of the lens cap.When I use the camera, it has odd focusing issues. It has difficulty focusing sometimes. For example, it often leaves a group of people posing awkwardly, while the camera lens goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...and the final image might show the group out of focus, but a tree somewhere in the background in perfect focus.It also can't take photos from close range, less than about 18 inches. I tried to take a photo of a small receipt I was submitting to my health insurance company, since I don't have a scanner. It took about ten photos before I got one in focus. I had to pull the camera way back from the receipt, then zoom all the way forward. And boy, does this camera eat batteries. Don't even think of going away from home overnight without bringing your battery charger and a set of spares. It uses four AA batteries, so consider the additional bulk of the charger and spares if you often take many photos in between uploads to your computer.On the positive side, image quality is great, if you manage to get a photo properly focused. No distortion at the edges of the frame, just perfect images (provided the focus is right). Also, saving time to the CompactFlash card is really fast, so you can snap away with photo after photo, without that embarrassing \"everyone hold that pose a little longer, the camera's saving the last photos\" explanation.I'm living overseas, so my 30-day guarantee from Amazon expired around the time I received the camera. I wish I'd ordered it on a US trip, so I could have returned it right away and bought a more compact model. I'm stuck with it now, but I suspect I'll be buying another camera within the next year or so, when I get tired of lugging this thing around.UPDATE FROM JANUARY 2004: The camera stopped working entirely and wouldn't take any more photos. I went to the Minolta.com website to find where to take the camera for warranty service, now that I'm back in the US. But the only way to get your camera serviced is to mail it to some address in New Jersey. I e-mailed Minolta's customer service multiple times, and no one ever replied. What a huge mistake it was to buy this camera. I wish there were some way to get any of my money back.","Date":"December 27, 2003"}

After a year or two of replacing batteries, the battery case cover will wear out.  The 6 volt DC input connector can be used to operate the camera for downloading to your PC, but not for charging the batteries.  Non rechargable Alkaline batteries supplied with the camera are only good for about 15 shots, so buy a 24 pack of them.

The camera was shipped w/out necessary items -- no usb cable, no owner's manual; I should have said \"This is not right, and send it back\" My trust in Minolta overcame any worries about working any 'kinks' out. Bad mistake!!I regret to say; the camera has never worked properly; it is presently frozen with the zoom lens out and it will not move.And, just recently -- surprises of all surprises -- ha haThis camera is no longer manufactured.

I bought this digital camera (my first) last Sept.,2004 after much checking, prices & features from several sources and I thought I made a good choice. Afterall I had a Minolta Maxxum 7000 35mm and was quite pleased with it. However this DiMage 414 was as bad a choice as I have ever made in my life, including my first wife. I got several AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and chargers which worked well but this camera ate batteries. When I took it somewhere to take shots I had to take several sets of recharged batteries along. I actually purchased slim plastic battery carriers to stuff in the oversized camera bag I was forced to buy to accomadate them,Konica Minolta is too cheap to include a bag or case. Now as of this date I am looking for a replacement camera for this wonderfull Konica Monolta Dimage 414 gem which stopped working completely recently. A lesson learned. To anyone even thinking about buying this camera: Please save yourself money and frustration by NOT buying this camera-buy something else, take it from one who learned the hard way. You don't suppose that when Minolta merged with Konica their products became subpar?","Date":"June 30, 2005"}

Here's why...:1. This camera is very bulky compared with almost any camera (for the same resolution) out there in the market. Since this camera is not available for display in popular electronic stores, you really cannot hold it in your hand and get a feel for it BEFORE you buy it. I like my camera to be slim and small. Else I don't feel like carrying it with me when I ought to. What then is the point of buying a camera?2. This camera is power hungry!. It sucks the juice out of the batteries in no time. I find myself changing batteries all the time. And yes, I do use NiMH batteries as the manufacturer reccomends. Talking of replacing batteries, the battery compartment door looks pretty flimsy and doesn't lock very well. I have a premonition that this door is going to dictate the life of this camera.3.

I took it to the factory repair facility in Cypress, California, twice for repair.  Both times I was told the camera had been repaired when I picked it up.  In truth, it wasn't repaired either time.  In fact the second time I picked it up I wasn't even out of the building before it experienced the same problems.When I took it back a third time for repair (a one hundred mile plus round trip) they kept the camera and told me I'd be receiving a replacement within one to two weeks.  We are now at almost four weeks and I can't get an answer as to when to expect my replacement.  Getting through to their customer support department is a problem.  The shortest I've waited on hold being told \"how they realize how important my time is\" has been twenty minutes.  In frustration I even sent them a fax trying to get resolution to this problem.

But after a while I got some bad experiences with this camera.The average amount of pictures you can take with (very good) 2000MAh NiMH Batteries is only 20 to 40 depending on the Environment temperature.I measured the Power consumption and it was not so bad (0.7 Ampere with display on) this should last for 3 hours and some hundreds of pictures. Unfortunately the camera switches of at a battery voltage of 1.2 volts. At this time the Bateery is still 70% full!Another point is that the camera freezes with battery-voltage below 1.2 V per cell and you have to reset the camera by opening the batt-compartement door.Conclusion: The powerconsumption is very little, but the power-management of the camera together with NiMH Batteries is terrible.Imagine a car that stops with a fuel level of 2/3 - unbelievable!I dont undestand how a company like olympus can bring a camera to the market that does not manage to work properly with the most common NiMH Batteries.","Date":"June 3, 2003"}

However, I have had continuous battery problems with it.  I've downloaded firmware and even sent it back to the manufacturer.  It takes about 2 pictures and then powers down.  It is beyond frustrating especially when you're trying to get a candid shot.  I've also had a lot of problems with the candid shots in that you never capture what you think you have because it doesn't respond fast enough.I've even had problems with scanning through the pictures on the camera.

{"Title":"Disappointing!","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R37QA2KE0BR6F","Overall":"bad","Content":"After reading reviews on several 2M pixel cameras, I decided to buy the Nikon 2100 for my daughter. While the unit has 3X optical zoom and is conveniently small, there are several significant shortcomings that made me return the camera:- In Auto mode, there is a 2-4 second delay from the time you depress the shutter release until the camera focuses and takes the picture. I found this unacceptable. I confirmed with Nikon technical support that this cannot be changed when in auto mode. (My Fuji 2600 has almost no delay and it is 2M, 3X, and auto-focus also.)- The LCD monitor comes on by default whenever you turn the camera on. I prefer to use the viewfinder and only rarely use the LCD panel to take shots. There may be a way to change this but I could not easily find out how.- The manual is confusing. There are three modes for selecting and changing options - Set-up, Menu, and direct buttons for some features. The manual doesn't clarify which mode to use for various options. Confusing.- The CRV3 battery that comes with the unit is almost impossible to install. You have to force it into the camera and force the battery cover closed. The battery cover is quite flimsy and feels like it might break. (It didn't.)- The Image Quality/size selection is quite limited (no 960 x 1280).","Date":"June 14, 2003"}

After taking the camera home I came to realize the reviews I had read on-line were very misleading.I have been a digital camera users since the early 90's and have had owned a number of different models (HP, Canon, Casio, Olympus) this being my first Nikon.After bringing the camera home I proceeded to set the camera up for my first picture, doing so I can into a few problems, first being power.  The camera comes with one Panasonic CV battery (not a rechargeable).  The battery was dead leaving me no choice but to load the camera with lithium AA's.  To reduce the size of the camera it only held two AA's or one CV-3,  the battery life of the AA was approx. 1 min. or 3 pics.After a little frustration and approx. 6 sets of batteries I went out and purchased a CV-3 replacement.  The new battery worked fine but the camera did not,  the auto focus on the camera took a very, very, very long time to lock in on the image (3-4 second).  During this time the subject would have moved or ran away.  After doing some investigating I came to realize the Nikon was known for the delayed shutter,  I found this very hard to work with.  After a night out with the family and several attempts of capturing a good, quality photo I gave up.The following day I took the camera back and purchased a Canon A70, a step up from my A20.  I love the canon, it is very quick to snap the picture and had a great battery life (with my lithium rechargeable AA's).  The Nikon 3100 may take good pictures but if you have to wait 4 seconds for the camera to snap you better make sure your subject is either tied down or sleeping..If you decide to purchase the camera after reading this review,  I have one suggestion \"Keep the Receipt\".","Date":"November 6, 2003"}

And it's easy to hold in one hand.  But that's about the only thing you'll enjoy about this camera.  While the fact that it runs on two AA batteries might seem like a convenience, this camera runs through batteries so quickly that I always carry two extra pairs--of the expensive electronics-quality alkalines.  The rechargeable batteries it comes with only hold a charge for ten or so pictures.  And when the batteries run low, this camera is maddeningly slow as it records images onto the CF card and recharges the flash.  The red-eye reduction is also quite slow and I have missed quite a few good pictures due to these delays.  When I'm out with the family and want to take a few pictures, I almost always end up paying more attention to this camera than my kids.  The pictures are decent but sometimes have a blue-ish or white-ish quality.  I originally bought this camera for my wife; she'd have nothing to do with it and now it's mine.

With the 775 I consistently got very nice snapshots. I've owned this camera for about 8 weeks and I'm still struggling to get decent photos. Night shots are almost impossible. Maybe my memory card is too slow, but it takes forever to get setup for the next picture.The redeye feature doesn't work and the shutter lag is too long.I sprung for rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and I'm pretty satisfied with their life, but it took about two weeks before they would really keep a charge.","Date":"December 11, 2003"}

I got it right after it came on the market and at that time the reviews were all good. I was really pleased with it except for the way it eats batteries.  In cold weather I can only get two photos on recharged batteries, and where I live it is cold much of the year. I liked the small size and The picture quality was really great. Everyone admired the photos I took with this camera.  But the on-off control has broken and fallen off.  And no wonder; the fault was with a very cheesy thin plastic part that broke because it couldn't take the wear and tear of being turned on and off.  For what it cost, I should have had much more use from it.  The other downsides to this camera were that I had to buy as extras all the cords, transformer, case, memory cards  and other accessories needed to make it functional.  Nothing came with it except a small 8mb memory card.  Now I'm stuck with a couple hundred dollars worth of accessories that are all useless with another camera.

I took about one hundred photos recently at Walt Disney World at night mainly of my children.  Only five of the pictures were any good.  The night mode focuses to infinity leaving your subject blurry. Without the night mode the flash is so weak it's useless. The red eye reduction takes forever to fire the picture which means your subjects (children) have moved leaving a terrible shot.  All the indoor photos proved to be poor also. The camera is just not quick enough to fire. If you have small children and are going to try to photograph them, I would avoid this camera.I gave it two stars because it is easy to use and compact, but that's not why you buy a camera.

All pictures taken were unnaturally blue and no amount of ajusting of color fixed this.  The horizontal lines also returned a day after they returned the camera.

The pictures appear to come out nice and the menus are pretty easy to navigate through.Supplying a 16 MB card with the camera is a crime (10 highest resolution pics).  Be prepared to buy a 128 MB card right from the start.  This model should ship standard with at least 32MB and most likely 64 MB.  But cards are relatively cheap these days [money amount]for 128 MB so not a big deal.However I have to agree with PC World magazine this camera is too slow especially when taking photos in lower light conditions.  The action that you want to capture will be long over before this camera takes the shot.  It takes a pre-flash and then 1-2 seconds later takes the actual shot with another flash.  I couldn't even get a shot of my Lab trying to take a treat out of my wife's hands and I tried 3 times.  Never had this problem with my last camera which was an Olympus.  Also when preview the pics on the LCD the photos start out blurry and then after a second or so they focus in. So I will be returning this camera in a day or two and going possibly with a Canon Powershot A70, which is a top rated camera for the same price.  The Canon according to PC World has better quality images and fast snap speeds.  Still researching a replacement so not a 100% sure on the Canon.","Date":"September 1, 2003"}

After about a year I started having a lot of trouble with this camera, I couldn't get it to turn on or take pictures at all.  I called Sony's service center and they wanted $120 just to look at it.  I'm not the only person I've heard of to have these problems with this camera.  I would suggest finding another model or you will be shopping for another one not long after the warranty expires.","Date":"January 26, 2006"}

{"Title":"Worthless Warranty","Author":"Chaits","ReviewID":"R3QGQ9JVHSZZ0B","Overall":"bad","Content":"I purchased this camera less than a year back, and it was a pretty good companion while it lasted. As such I did not have many issues with the camera, other than the fact that the flash usually took too long to recharge, for example, if I could get a snap of my nephew giving a piece of b'day cake to mom, then definitely the flash wudnt recharge in time to get a snap of the dadz cake feeding :(But my main complain is that I had problems with the camera shutter. It just wouldnt open. As the camera was in warranty, I spoke with the people at Sony, only to be told that they would charge $120 to even take a look at the camera, their so called Labour charges... Well, then what exactly is the point of the warranty? With the new cameras costing around 100, this was exceptionally ridiculous...Well, I am done with Sony cameras for sure...","Date":"January 27, 2006"}

{"Title":"Stay away from Sony Digital Cameras","Author":"N. Palikhya","ReviewID":"RBYNJVI2V9SQG","Overall":"bad","Content":"Don't buy a Sony. Period. Sony may make some great electronics but they suck when it comes to digital cameras. I bought a Cybershot DSCP72. The pictures were ok except at night or in low light. At 6 months, the flash stopped working. Now I can only take pictures when there is ample light. What good is that?I had the worst experience with customer service. They kept trying to evade the issue and kept telling me it was the batteries. They told me that only parts were convered by the warrenty and it would cost me $139 just to get it looked at to see what was wrong with it. I wonder how much it would have cost to fix it on top of the $139. Sony was very unaccomodating. I am never going to buy another Sony digital camera, if any electronic gadget at all. I did not get any response when I sent an email complaining either. I am so disappointed with Sony.So in summary do not buy a Sony digital camera. And if you do, do not expect to get much out of customer support when things go south with your camera.

{"Title":"Very disappointed","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R1QHKT1H8UDOSC","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've had this camera for about a month and I have to say I'm very disappointed with the way it handles artificially lit conditions (like nighttime football games).  The automatic exposure control seems to vary widely from one shot to the next under these conditions, and it's very difficult to get a nighttime picture that isn't blurry.  The only way I've been able to make it behave is to go to manual settings, and even then the pictures aren't as sharp as my old 1.3 Megapixel Olympus in full automatic mode.  Also, I found the greens to be oversaturated as reported by several other users.  Daytime photos are generally good, although they can be overexposed.  I'm not a novice photographer, but this camera sure makes me look like one.  On the plus side, the size is great, the movie mode works well, transfers to the computer couldn't be easier, and battery life is reasonably good.  Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the serious problems with the automatic exposure control. My recommendation:  There are much better performers for a lot less money.  Choose one of them instead.","Date":"October 27, 2003"}
{"Title":"Good while it lasted","Author":"Thomas Landis","ReviewID":"R2UEYW749L7SAD","Overall":"bad","Content":"Let me begin by saying that I have bought into Sony's proprietary technology for quite a while now.  As an owner of a Vaio desktop, a Clie handheld and a Sony Digital HandyCam, it was obvious that when it came time to upgrade to a quality digital still camera, I was going to buy a Sony Cybershot.  So after reviewing the options, which at the time consisted only of the P10, the V1 and the then-new U series of super compacts, I chose this model in the spring of 2004.  Initially, my experience was good.  I was upgrading from the 1MP camera that was part of my Sony Digital HandyCam so the image quality to me was astounding.  Other advantages were:- Easy point & shoot right out of the box...it did not require my wife to read the manual in order to begin taking stills.- Unlike my previous digital still experiences, this camera performs well in low-light situations.  The integrated flash is capable of lighting small rooms.- Battery capacity is ample and the features, although some difficult to use, are comprehensive.  Disadvantages:- STARTUP TIME...don't expect this camera to be able to power-up and take a candid shot within 8-10 seconds.  By the time you get this puppy ready to fire, the moment is gone.- The menu tree is cumbersome and not altogether intuitive.  Changing advanced settings is difficult unless all you want to do is switch modes (Program AE, etc.)- As with most still cameras (Sony & the like), the included MemoryStick is way too small.  So the purchase of an additional MS is obligatory.My biggest beef with this camera, and the reason it earns only two stars is that it seems FRAGILE.  After only 5-6 months of use, it began to occasionally have startup/shutdown problems.  By the end of 2004 (~9 months of use) the auto focus was beginning to fail on a regular basis.  Now, outside the 6-month warranty window, I am forced to pay $200 to $300 for LABOR ALONE to have the camera fixed, parts still covered under the original warranty.  But still, this is a cost prohibitive solution.So now I am at the crossroads with my Sony products.  My PDA is approaching the end of its useful life and I find myself without a digital still camera that is capable of taking any pictures in focus -- remember the cyber-shots do not provide for manual focus.  Perhaps it is time to consider a Canon product or other comparible vendor?","Date":"January 24, 2005"}

I bought it because of the good review, all the features, light weight, small and most of all because is a 'SONY'First we were pretty impressed with it. The only problem we had was the standard memory card given was way to small. We can take only about 30 shot each time. Then after a month the picture turn blurry and fuzzy sometimes. So far we took only 250 pictures with it.Then last month the flash gave up on us. We read the manual and tried to fix the problem but nothing help. We call the SONY help line and they can't solved the problem either. If we want to get it repair we have to send it all the way to TEXAS as they don't have any customer service or repair technician here in LA or California. And it will cost us $171.00 excluding S/H for the workmanship. What made me mad was I paid $420.00 for this camera and it is not cheap. I expected much more from this camera for the amount I paid. If the camera cost only $200.00 I won't be so heart sick about it.We decided not to repair it because with the cost of the repair we can buy a BRAND NEW CAMERA that works much better than a \"SONY'.

In my opinion the camera it's self really isn't anything to write home about. The lens is junk, my pictures always are pixelated. Compare a Sony picture with an Olympus, Minolta, or Canon, even with a lower amount of Megapixels the quality will beat sony at the highest setting. And if you reduce the Megapixels with Sony the images just degrades and the shutter speed is horrible. If a person moves slitely there is a blur. My choice after seeing and talking to friends is 1) Minolta 2) Olympus 3)Canon ... though the Canon is getting better and better with their newer rechargable battery.

{"Title":"What they dont tell you...","Author":"James M. Koury","ReviewID":"R1ADT47SFBRNJN","Overall":"bad","Content":"Since everyone is telling you all the good stuff, I thought I would focus on what I found wrong with the camera (I would actually rate it a 3-3.5.  I just rated it a 1 for the article because I am focusing on what I didn't like).One of the most annoying features (and technically embarrassing for Sony) is that the internal viewfinder and LED do NOT crop the photo the same way.  As an example, take a picture of a horizontal line on a wall, and position the camera so that the line is at the top edge of the photo.  If you use the LED on the back of the camera, the line in the photo will appear about where it should be.  However if you take the same picture using the internal viewfinder, the photo will show the line about 15-20% of the way below the top edge of the photo.  Therefore, on bright days when you have to use the internal viewfinder, whatever you shoot photos of appear much lower in the photo than how you actually cropped it.  It is very annoying as you try to compensate by guessing.  This is very sloppy engineering.  Other annoying features include:The wide angle/telephoto control makes exaggerated adjustments that make fine adjustment difficult.  This is very annoying when trying to make fine cropping adjustments.You cannot delete photos off the stick using Windows Explorer.  If you want to delete all the photos off the stick, you have to drill down several levels into the camera menu.To turn on \"Red Eye Reduction\", you have to turn off the camera mode, and go several levels into the menu mode.  This is very annoying when you have people waiting to take their picture.  There should be a direct access button to this common feature.There is little photo quality consistency.  While some outdoor photos look fantastic, seemingly similar conditions produce washed out photos.Why am I keeping it?  You still have to love all the features that they DO pack into something this small. You gotta love the size!!!","Date":"December 13, 2003"}
{"Title":"Shutter delay makes this camera unusable.","Author":null,"ReviewID":"R3QHIP8W0HRM24","Overall":"bad","Content":"I received this camera yesterday and began trying it out.  I tried to take pictures of my cat and my daughter under medium light conditions (indoors at night, but well lit).  The shutter delay made taking pictures impossible.  I depressed the shutter half way and waited, but my cat ran out of the room (frightened by the bright orange autofocus helper light) before the camera could get ready to take the picture and my 3 year old looked away.  The average shutter delay for these conditions was around 3sec(which is completely unacceptable).  The autofocus has such a hard time with lighting that half of the pictures turned out blurry.  I would not recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take candid pictures of real subjects.  It's almost impossible even using burst mode to capture those \"once in a lifetime\" shots.  Also when I called SONY tech support for help I wasted a bunch of time with an automated system and finally got to a guy with a thick accent that was difficult to understand.  He basically read page 21 out of the manual to me.  What a joke!This could be a good camera if the shutter delay was shorter.  On still life objects the camera gave impressive results and great special effects - like the sepia mode.  Also the movie capture is very cool if you can get the proper lighting.I would not buy this camera again.  I am actually returning it.","Date":"December 17, 2003"}

But with the flash the pictures look like they were taken of people in a pitch black room with no light, except the flash lighting them up. Horrible.I called Sony customer care, which has so far been excellent, and they told me to send the camera in for repairs. (...)","Date":"May 12, 2004"}
{"Title":"do NOT buy this camera","Author":"Deborah White \"whitepearlman\"","ReviewID":"R34JUVBOS1QU80","Overall":"bad","Content":"I bought this camera in August 2003.  In September the LCD screen broke for the first time.  This occurred after I traveled by plane with the camera in a SONY camera case, carried onto the plane with me, not in the overhead compartment.  It was still under warranty and we got it fixed.I had a baby in Jan 2004.  While home on maternity leave, taking lots of pictures everyday, the LCD cracked again.  This was with what I consider normal use at home.  I believe it cracked b/c I placed it (I did not DROP it) on the table with the LCD screen facing down.  I handled this camera with care.  I am not a klutz.When I examined the structure of the camera, I saw that the LCD has no protective \"frame\" around it.  It just sticks out from the camera, open to any insult, however minor it might seem.  Other sony cameras have a metal frame around the LCD (think of it as a picture in a frame, vs a picture in glass without a frame).  Anyway, I am so angry because this was a pretty expensive camera and I think there is a major design flaw here.  Take my advise, save yourself a lot of money and aggravation, look at the camera you buy in person and make sure it has a metal frame around the LCD screen","Date":"May 13, 2004"}

I tried to buy a camera from Sony's website. The deal never went through, although I gave my credit card details. Amazingly, Sony, in spite of not being able to sell the product, nevertheless reserved the total amount of the deal from my credit card for nearly three weeks! Hours of phone calls could not fix the situation -- Sony only said that my credit card balance would eventually get corrected. Sony could not deliver the product, yet they took my money for three weeks. Because of this, my travel booking got cancelled due to credit card balance being over the limit.Never, never, never buy a Sony! They are crooks!

The manual states I should get 75 images with the supplied alkalines.I installed Quest 1300mah NIMH rechargables, like everyone suggests, and got about 9 images and one movie before the batteries died. The manual states I should get 200 images with rechargables.I'm thinking of buying the new 2200mah rechargables, but I'm already disappointed with the camera's use of power and I'm not sure the 2200s will even get me 20+ images.I'm seriously thinking of returning this item....UPDATE:(2/3/04)I did buy some 2200 mAh batteries and with the LCD defaulting to off and using the eyepiece, I can say that the camera is usable, but only for occational use.

Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular \"vacation\" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities.

If this doesn't happen to you, then you'll probably be very happy with this camera. If it does, then don't expect them to honor the warranty. In my case, they wanted to charge me $105.00 to fix it, claiming there was \"impact damage\" to the camera (there was no impact). What's really annoying is that, even in this day and age, the only way to contact the service facility is to phone, wait on hold for 15 minutes, then have to leave a voice mail that they promise to \"promptly\" return. I left 3, they returned one (2 business days later) and left me a voice mail. My letter to company headquarters has been totally ignored for over a month.

It was returned to us as \"repaired\" but the problems were never fixed.Problems:(1) The camera often comes on with blurs of colored stripes across the screen. It will not take a picture except of the colored stripes. There is no rhyme or reason to when or why this happens. I've missed many great shots because of this problem.(2) At least 1/4 of my pictures in Europe were ruined because the A60 didn't adjust properly for backlighting. I didn't realize there was a problem until I had some pictures printed after I got home. Diagonally the pictures were completely whited out. Sometimes the camera worked fine using the same angles. Photography is my hobby.

Canon will repair this widely seen CCD defect for free even if your camera is out of warranty.See the A70 support page on Canon's website or search for \"PowerShot A70 CCD failure\".[...]Unfortunately, Canon isn't making this offer conspicuous on its website and is not contacting customers proactively. I only learned of it on an independent camera review website.I had contacted Canon Support about terrible noise problems in photos I'd taken (often discovered only later, when reviewing photos on the computer), and at first they failed to reply, let alone inform me of the free repair program. After discovering the recall notice, I contacted them again to request free repair, and they've agreed to repair my camera.In other respects, I've been very happy with the PowerShot A70's features and performance, but not very impressed with some design defects and this CCD problem. The only mitigating factor with the CCD defect is that several other manufacturers' cameras have been affected by the same problem, though they've dealt with their customers better in addressing it. Olympus offers to repair cameras with CCDs that may be defective, regardless of whether the camera is currently exhibiting problems.This issue, combined with a Canon camcorder that is now unreliable due to a widely-seen recorder section problem, severely undermines Canon's reputation for quality. This is especially disappointing for me because I believe Canon's products are often functionally superior, and I previously had Canon film cameras that were bulletproof.","Date":"March 23, 2006"}
{"Title":"Prospective Canon A-Series buyers, please read!","Author":"Hunakai","ReviewID":"RW43NJ5AOZX1L","Overall":"bad","Content":"PLEASE CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING A CANON 'A' SERIES CAMERA. Slightly more than a year ago I bought a Canon PowerShot A70, having read many excellent reviews of it and having compared it with other 3MP cameras then on the market. Until a few days ago (when its warranty had lapsed by several weeks) the camera was a joy; all the good things said about it in its many reviews had proven true. But then, one afternoon, out of the blue, an 'E18!' error: the camera's optical unit failed, the lens would not retract, and the camera became completely nonfunctional. To no avail I tried the few remedies suggested by Canon tech support on line, by e-mail, and over the phone (where responses were quick, courteous, but completely ineffectual). The telephone tech rep then informed me that I could send the camera, at my expense, to Canon, who would repair it for anywhere from $100 to $200. I asked him if lens-unit failure was a common problem with the camera (already, from the dozens of reports I'd read on the web, I knew it was), and, quite candidly, he replied that it was. He added that this was true with ALL PowerShot 'A' series cameras, so that I could not buy a subsequent model (e.g., A75 or A80) with any confidence that the 'E18' problem would not occur with it. Please read the negative reviews of this camera and consider that the problems described may affect your camera (and those of the rave review writers) several weeks or months into ownership. For over 40 years I had been a highly satisfied user of Canon products (most of them, unlike the new digital cameras, made in Japan). No longer, alas, since I shall not buy another Canon camera.","Date":"July 24, 2004"}

Hmmm...tooks some pictures, and the problem is not in the LCD, it's in the camera. I tried the universal repair method of tapping it on the top and sides, and lo and behold, it works again. Some more taps, and squiggly lines, and occasionally not working. Looks like there is something loose inside.Call Canon to see about a repair, thinking it will probably take them 10 seconds to fix it by re-fastening something inside, and they  tell me it will be a minimum of $100, or $150 to replace with a newly refurbished A70 with 6 month warranty. Whaaa...?Check online prices for new A75 with more features, and see that they are available for not much over $180. Easy decision.I also see that Olympus and Kodak and Nikon also have products in the same price range. Wonder how their reliability is?So my plan is to buy a new camera from somebody that is not Canon, and take my A70 apart myself and see if I can diagnose the problem. Probably a loose connector is my guess.Buy something else. This camera will break your heart, and do it out of warranty.","Date":"November 4, 2004"}

I couldn't look at old pictures I had taken.  Furthermore, since the camera needs to be in replay mode to download pictures, I couldn't even get them onto my computer.  I sent the camera back for repair ($10+ shipping that Canon doesn't cover) and they repaired it in about 3 weeks.  Problem solved.  Or was it...* A month after that, horizontal lines started to appear on LCD, and also on the pictures I took.  Annoying, but I dealt with it.  Some pictures were so distorted, it looked like LSD rather than LCD.  After a while, the display would totally give out and remain black about 50% of the time.  The resulting pictures were also black.  I sent the camera in again for repair ($10+ shipping).  This time Canon fixed it and sent it back within a week.Canon gets halfway decent marks for doing the repairs smoothly, and the camera itself is great.

{"Title":"Let's Sue!","Author":"Ana","ReviewID":"R3S37RXSI94L71","Overall":"bad","Content":"I had the e18 error two months after purchasing this camera.  I got it fixed because I had no choice and had just spent $299 purchasing the stupid camera.  This cost me $120.  Now, 14 months after I purchased it, the camera has the black and purple lines on the LCD.  I have a four month old baby that I'd like to take pictures of but can't.  I am so mad!!  I will never ever buy another Canon product.  Let's sue them for a faulty product.  Just wanted to update this review to post the following reply from Canon about my problem:We are sorry to hear of the difficulty you have experienced with the LCD screen on your PowerShot A70.  Please note, Canon USA does not monitor, confirm, endorse, or attest to the accuracy of any information posted on third party websites.  Itseems many customers are overwhelmed by the barrage of information (or misinformation) being posted on unregulated, non-Canon websites.  Unfortunately, this is not something over which Canon has any control.  We are able only to confirm the performance of the camera based on our own testing.  Canon USA has not released any service notifications regarding an issuewith the LCD screen.  Since the camera is more than one year old, it is out of warranty.  We have two options available: you may send the camera in for repair, or you may participate in our PowerShot Upgrade program.  The standard labor cost to make the repair will range from $100 to $200. Parts may be an additional cost.  Cameras damaged by impact, liquid, or sand may have a considerably higher repair cost, depending on theresults of the Factory Service Center's evaluation.So even though this has happened to many people and on many websites there are similar complaints about this model, Canon won't take responsibility.  If you've experienced problems, I suggest you call them.  A better suggestion, don't buy Canon products.  The repair and upgrade program they refer to are both jokes.  $100-$200 to repair a camera that now costs $180?  Ha! or a $150 for a refurbished camera that will likely break again.","Date":"October 10, 2004"}

Apparently, it's quite common.My only recourse was to mail this camera to Canon, since it had been more than 30 days since I bought it from Amazon.  What a pain that was - with a newborn at home.  The camera came back in about 3 weeks, took exactly 2 pictures, then broke again the same way.  I called Canon and raised as much heck as I could, but in the end had to mail it back to them again.  The best they could do was send me a shipping label.  So, I took my 3 week old son out to a UPS depot to mail it.  Not my idea of fun.I am currently waiting for it to return again.

That is over a third of what it cost.  There are two many people out there complaining about the same E18 error coming up all of a sudden and rendering the camera inoperable. Follow up on 9/17/2003:  I asked the folks at the service center how the E18 error could be caused by the impact when it continued to work after I dropped it (causing the scuff mark).  They told me that any outer damage to the camera renders the warranty void even if the scuff marks are not related to the E18 error.

My options were either to junk the camera and lost $300 investment in it or agree to their demand. I would have expected Canon to repair it for free because the camera was discovered to be non-functional within 13 months of the purchase and at the time of discovery had not been used for over a month.

After having come to terms with my misfortune, I returned the camera to the shop and promptly obtained a replacement. Dissapointment then turned to downright disgust, as the function button on my substitued A70 completely failed to work-nothing, not a whisper. Holding my head in my hands, I once again returned to the shop and after much deliberation I decided to give it one more shot (excuse the pun), assuming that the laws of probability would prevent any additional grief; alas, as the shop assistant was telling me how they had sold thousands with no problems, the third camera showed the exact same symptoms as the first-only one of the shutter blades closed properly.Now it is likely that my misfortune could never be equalled but a word of warning to those purchasing this model: you may want to buy it in a shop to prevent yourself from having to send anything to a mail-order company in timbuktu and never seeing your camera again.

If it were not now, after 13 months of ownership, simply taking up space in a box in my closet (I keep hoping some recall will take place, but doesn't look that way).  Really too bad, I thought this camera had everything.I am not a big camera user.  I would say I used this camera once or twice a month to take a few pictures of something.  The camera was always stored in a nice padded holder...never dropped, never mishandled.  And yet, six months in, the lens stuck and I received my first E18 error.  After some jiggling, I managed to get it to retract and that was that.  A month later, same problem...same resolution.  This would happen about half the time after that, and a call to Canon told me it was probably dust (every time?) and to use canned air.  I did so, and it would resolve itself.  I skipped using the camera the eleventh and twelth month of ownership (i.e. within warranty), and on the thirteenth (OUT of warranty) the camera REALLY began acting up.  It was always hit and miss as to whether the camera would work at all...eventually the lens would retract and I might get to use it.  In my naivete, I tried new batteries *roll eyes, I was desperate, ok?*  I had two good usages with no problems, then took the camera to Disney World.  First time out of the bag the camera froze, and has remained so since.  Fixing it will cost me almost the price of the camera to start with.Given A70's demand when it came out, I felt lucky to be able to get my hands on one..beware what you wish for, right?  A search for \"Canon\" and \"e18\" online absolutely ASTOUNDED me with the huge number of complaints on this issue of the lens sticking.  I wish I'd known this beforehand.  Clearly there is a problem, and while a flawed product is forgivable, Canon's lack of interest and response in taking care of it will keep me from buying a Canon product again.Before buying, I truly urge you to consider and do your research before you buy a Canon product, this is not just occuring on the A70's.  If you are absolutely determined, I highly urge you buy an extended warrenty as these errors are occuring on average within the first 18 months of ownership.","Date":"January 28, 2005"}

It takes wonderful pictures and is easy to use.  I have used the video function numerous times and it works great.  When I bought the camera, Consumer Reports recommended this camera.HOWEVER, this camera is apparently designed to \"fail\" between 1 and 2 years of use, depending on how often you use it. After exactly 2 years of use (4,217 pictures), my camera also now gives me the black/purple screen that numerous other consumers have complained about.  When the camera decides to be operational, the majority of the pictures now come out blurry.  This camera has turned from the best camera I have ever used to an unreliable piece of junk.","Date":"December 20, 2005"}
{"Title":"CANON customer service stinks!!!","Author":"Rose Gardener","ReviewID":"R2N3ZMTXFA5VFA","Overall":"bad","Content":"WARNING!  CANON CUSTOMER SERVICE STINKS!  Our experience indicates that if you buy a Canon, you should be prepared to pay for the camera a second time in repairs.  This is regardless of extended warrantees.  BEWARE!This is the second Canon Powershot camera we have owned.  We have had problems with both and in both cases Canon has refused to repair the camera without paying a very high flat fee.  The first time the problem occurred after the warrantee period, so we paid it - about $150.  Supposedly the camera was then covered for a 3 month further period.  Within one month the camera completely failed to work again.  We called Canon service long distance from China, where we had taken the camera, but they refused to repair it saying that the warrantee was not in effect because the problem was a different one than the one they had previously repaired.  We swore we would never buy another Canon.  But, STUPID US!, we read reviews that said Canon was best in our desired type and price range, so we purchased a Canon A70.  It is still within the first year warrantee period, but now again Canon refuses to fix it unless we pay the flat fee - this time $100 plus shipping and handling!  They say that the reason is that the camera was dropped.  We know that there is a small dent on the side of the camera, but we do not want or need that fixed.  The problem is that the camera does not take pictures, its obvious and essential function.  This problem developed months after the small dent in the corner of the camera.  We have tried calls and so far Canon has refused to fix the camera.  WE WARN YOU NOT TO BUY CANON!  DO NOT BE AS STUPID AS WE HAVE BEEN!","Date":"February 5, 2005"}

I'm in Iraq right now and my wife was using our camera the other day taking pictures of the kids and it stopped working.  After going through all the troubleshooting, she still can't get it to work (won't turn on at all).  My initial thought is that it will cost well over $100 to fix and the camera really isn't worth much more than that now.  The camera is about two and a half years old and I figured for what I paid for it it should have lasted a lot longer.  So, I went from having a great camera to not having one at all.

In any case this seems very frustrating forcamera to only function for about a year and a half.Another issue is that if you purchase the wide angle adapterlens it will not work with the flash. I believe this is a designflaw. The lens is so wide it blocks the flash, and creats acurved dark area on the images.One last issue is that the view screen cover is plastic orsomething and is very easily scratched.

After a couple of years with the camera and several thousand exposures, some observations:- Optical viewfinder is junk - but this seems to be common in cameras of this price range. Shows only about 70% of view, and mine is also off about 10 degrees in rotation.- Picture quality is excellent as long as the \"ASA\" is kept on Auto or at or below 100. \"Auto ASA\" will net shutter/apertures at ASA 50 equivalent. At ASA 200 and 400, there is lots of noise and the camera will overexpose pictures taken in daylight.- Picture quality as \"high ASA\" speeds (200,400) has deteriorated over time. Beware if you are buying used. Pictures taken in low light are filled with noise, streaks, and \"sparkles\".- Power management is poor. Batteries die without warning (I've never seen the \"low battery\" indication), and camera has gotten \"stuck\" a couple of times in a mode where it seems to think even fresh batteries are no good; it has recovered after a few minutes with the batteries removed. Can take about 120 no-flash pictures on a set of 2000 maH NiMhs, with LCD mostly on. Battery life on alkalines is shorter than high-capacity NiMh's.- Autofocus has failed on about 1% of pictures.","Date":"May 27, 2004"}

Very disappointed, I sent it off to Canon on 11/10/03 to be repaired and here it is 12/20/03 and they still have not repaired it.  The factory repair staff has been nice enough and apologetic, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that I've been without my new camera 6+ weeks and will likely not have it back for the holidays.  It's bad enough when something like this breaks after 6 months, but even worse that they can't seem to fix it after having it for weeks and weeks.  If you buy one of these, just hope it doesn't break - you may not see it again for months.Update 12/22/03: Just received it back from Canon and, while it seems to take pictures now, there are two new problems: (1) The zoom only works occasionally (it worked fine when I sent it in) -the whole mechanism seems loose now. (2) One of the pixels in the viewfinder is shot.  So, after the holidays, back to Canon it goes.  I hope to at least get them to pay for postage.  Reducing this to one star - don't bother.

This seemed like a good feature at first with not having to recharge the battery all the time, but it also made the camera have a delay while taking pictures. The delay was long enough for me to miss many great shots. The batteries just aren't strong enough for a fast flash.My next camera will probably be a Pentax Optio M50. It is great for casual shots like when the family gets together. It is also only around $200 at the time of this review.

I take flower and plant closeups as a hobby and the focus zones for the lens are unpredictable and uncontrollable even in manual mode. About 60-70 percent of the closeups I take come out Completely Useless because the camera has chosen to focus on an element in the frame that I did not want to emphasize. For example, a leaf to the side will come out sharp, while the flower itself is an utter blur, even on \"macro\" mode, although the frame was composed with the flower at dead center. What's worse, when the image is previewed on the screen on the camera back, it appears to be fine!It does an adequate job with meta-pictures (whole scenes) but try to zoom in on an interesting insect or a tender bloom and you will soon go bald as a rock with frustration over the results. I used to take film pictures and got quite practiced at it, so this camera really annoys me because it refuses to behave like a standardized photographic instrument -- that is, when you point the lens at something and have it dead center in the frame, the lens is supposed to look for edges on that dead-center object and calculate focus accordingly.This piece of \"equipment,\" however, has a mind of its own, so you wind up with lovely background foliage and a muddy blur of color in the middle where a sharp image of a bloom should be.In short, if your photography makes any sort of technical demands and requires a sharp instrument to assist, Buy Something Else.If all you're looking for is a good snappy camera to take pictures of groups of friends or wide vistas, this camera will probably be fine.","Date":"September 19, 2006"}

{"Title":"Repair is too expensive","Author":"Ian R Ollmann \"Ian Ollmann\"","ReviewID":"R31O1NAXEOHUGQ","Overall":"bad","Content":"I've owned this camera for two years now. It has its issues. It wastes a lot of battery power by constantly pushing out and pulling in the lens every time the camera is turned on and off. It has a automatic power saver feature that autoshuts down the camera to make sure this happens regularly.  It also continuously projects movie like images on the LCD screen of what the camera sees -- nice power wasting feature. I only need it to do that when I am actually taking a picture, not all the time. As you might imagine, you'll get tired of changing the batteries. Low light pictures were never very good.The camera comes with a bewildering array of options but I found that 95% of them I never used.  There is a dial on top with a dozen special settings for various pictures. In my two years I've only used one. The same goes for the various image sizes, compression levels, etc. The one time I actually needed a feature, it failed:My mistake apparently was to attempt to delete pictures on the compact flash card using my computer's file browser. After I reinserted the CF card back in the camera, the camera refused to take pictures. I had the camera reformat the flash card and still wouldn't take pictures. I tried another CF card and it wont take pictures on that either. New batteries didn't help. Canon says that the repair will cost $200. Gee, thanks guys. The camera cost that much.The fact of the matter is that I feel that these cameras are too feature laden and kinda buggy. I really would prefer a digital camera that took digital pictures. Period. The computer can do everything I need. I don't need the pile of features to complicate the use of the thing. Ultimately, I feel that all this stuff has left Canon with a camera that is simply not robust.  Buy if you want, but understand that once it breaks, you are buying a new one, and all those features just make the thing break sooner.","Date":"February 20, 2005"}
{"Title":"Subject to Change (defective Camera)","Author":null,"ReviewID":"RUVOKWKO8EEGP","Overall":"bad","Content":"I received my A70 yesterday and was happy with the ease of use and apparent quality of photos taken. I was very impressed with the Software, I used PhotoStich to create a QuickTime VR very easy to use and impressive.When using the camera today after 15 shots the power switch failed, started but would not turn off (until auto shut off kicked in) than would not power up again.So it is going back ... for a replacement which will take over a week due to the way \"the store\" handles returns. But at \"this price\" it is hard to complain.Will update review when I have a working A70. But for now make sure you purchase this product only from a sell with a no hassle return policy.For a new product it is troubling when something a important and the power button fails after one day.This looked like a great camera on the spec sheet I only hope Canon Quality has not gone down the toilet.","Date":"April 11, 2003"}
{"Title":"Great Camera, Bad Company","Author":"John Bronson","ReviewID":"R1CG5J13JETMII","Overall":"bad","Content":"It's a great camera, but hope you never need support. The Canon support structure is bad and nearly non-existent. Very difficult to get to them. I have major problems with my Windows 98SE system and their TWAIN driver and after a week and four or more tries I finally got an email response that said it's a windows problem and they won't help (WON'T not CAN'T). The TWAIN driver doesn't work with my OS and it maybe my old hardware as well as the OS but everything else I try works. It's just their attitude and difficulty getting them to respond. By the way, the camera works okay on Windows XP. Just beware if you have older Hardware or OS - Support is basically not available or helpful and the TWAIN driver may not work or it may hang your system.","Date":"January 14, 2004"}
